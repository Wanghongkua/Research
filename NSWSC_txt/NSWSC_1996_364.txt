Regina versus F J Beattie [1996] NSWSC 364 (20 August 1996) 
REGINA versus FRANK JOHN BEATTIE /96 
TUESDAY 20 AUGUST 1996 
IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL 
GROVE J, JAMES J, HAMILTON AJ 
JUDGMENT 
GROVE J: The court is in a position to give judgment now and I will ask James J to give the first judgment.

JAMES J: Francis John Beattie appeals against convictions, after a trial conducted in the District Court before Judge Court QC and a jury, on one charge of supplying prohibited drugs, namely amphetamine, an offence under <case> of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act, and two charges of possessing a firearm whilst unlicensed, being a .22 calibre pistol and a .45 calibre revolver, which were offences under [s 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fa102/s5.html) of the [Firearms Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fa102/). On each charge the appellant was sentenced to a sentence of imprisonment for three years, consisting of a minimum term of two years three months and an additional term of nine months, all the sentences to be served concurrently and to date from 4 December 1995, the date on which during the trial the trial judge revoked the appellant's bail. In the event of his appeal against conviction being unsuccessful, the appellant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by Judge Court.

The trial was conducted in November and December 1995 and hence the [Evidence
Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) applied to the trial. Section 424A of the Crimes Act was not applicable.

The Crown case at the trial consisted of evidence given by six police officers, of whom the highest in rank was a Det Sgt Brown, and two others of whom were Detectives De Leau and Fitzgerald. The following statement of the
Crown case is taken from the evidence of some or all of those police officers.

At about 6pm on 16 February 1993, a number of police officers, including
Brown, De Leau and Fitzgerald, went to the vicinity of a house in Bay Street,
Rockdale. At about 9.45pm the appellant arrived at the premises. The appellant was stopped outside the premises by the police. The police knocked on the front door of the house, which was opened by a woman, who appears to have been
Anna Medley, the owner of the house and a person with whom the appellant had a relationship. The police produced a search warrant which they had obtained.
The evidence of Det Sgt Brown continued as follows: "I then went to the upstairs section of the house with the accused and
Detective De Leau. In a bedroom I said, 'We've been told you have a gun. Where is it?' He said, 'It's in my bag downstairs, I'll get it for you'. I then went with Beattie and De Leau to a room at the front of the house where I saw
Beattie indicate to a sports bag. He said, 'It's in the side pocket'. I then removed a silver .22 calibre Jennings brand pistol from this bag. I said, 'Is it loaded?' He said, 'yeah, but it is not cocked'. I then removed a magazine containing six projectiles from the weapon and I said, 'Have you got a licence for this?' He said, 'No'. I said, 'Your're under arrest for possession of an unlicensed pistol..." "I said, 'Where do you live?' He said, 'Flat 5 'Belinda' Queens Road,
Brighton. I said, 'Would you have any objection if we have a look there?' He said, 'No, there's nothing there anyway'. I said, 'Your've told us this is just your girl's place, do you have any drugs here?' He said, 'No'. I said, 'Which of these are yours?' At the same time I indicated to a number of bags on the floor. He said, 'Those two'. At the same time he indicated to the black shopping bag that the pistol had been removed from and a green shopping bag with 'Oxford Shops' written on the side...." "A short time later, again in company with De Leau and the accused, I went to premises at flat 5, 14 to 16 Queens Road, Brighton Le Sands. Just prior to leaving the Bay Street address, I saw Detective Parlett place the black sports bag and the Oxford shopping bag in the boot of the police car that I was occupying.

Upon arrival at the Queens Road address, I had a conversation with a man named
Bruce Beach. I then said to the accused, 'Which is your room?' and he said, 'Through here'. In company with De Leau and the accused, I then went to a bedroom of the apartment where I said to the accused, 'Have you got anything here you shouldn't have that you want to declare now?' He said, 'There's some speed in there, but it's at least 12 months old'. I then saw the accused rummage through a clothes basket and produce a cylindrical cream coloured container which he handed me. I then opened this container and saw a plastic bag containing white powder together with a smaller plastic bag which contained a beige coloured powder. Underneath that was a plastic bag which contained numerous empty resealable plastic bags. I said, 'I want you to understand that your're not obliged to say anything further unless you wish, but whatever you do say will be recorded and may later used in evidence. Do you understand that?' He said, 'Yes'. I said, 'Is there anything else here you shouldn't have? He said, 'No that's it'.

I then saw De Leau locate a set of scales on the top of some cupboards and he said to Beattie, 'What are these for?' The accused said, 'I'd forgotten they were there'. I also saw De Leau locate a canister from which he removed eight projectiles. De Leau said, 'What are these for?' He said, 'I think they go with the gun I had in my bag'. I said, 'What were you going to do with the amphetamines?' He said, 'I don't know. Use it. It's been there for ages'".

The police and the appellant then went to the Drug Unit office at Surry Hills.
Det Fitzgerald gave evidence that at the Drug Unit office he searched the green Oxford Shops shopping bag which had been taken from the house at
Rockdale and found a .45 calibre revolver in it. Det Fitzgerald handed the revolver to Det Sgt Brown. Det Sgt Brown approached the appellant with the revolver and asked: "What's this for?" The appellant said: "The guns are for my own protection." 
The appellant declined to be interviewed in an electronically recorded interview and declined to make a written statement. He later agreed to participate, and participated, in an electronically recorded interview in which he stated that he did not wish to be further interviewed.

The events and conversations of the evening as alleged by the police had been recorded by Det De Leau in his notebook. The appellant was shown the notebook and asked to sign the notes. The appellant said: "I don't like the idea of signing anything." 
I turn now to the defence case at the trial.

At the trial the appellant made an unsworn statement. He said that on the evening of 15 February 1993 he had gone to a greyhound meeting to cash a cheque with a friend named Jenkins. At the meeting Jenkins gave, or rather lent, the appellant the sum of $6,500 or $7,000 in cash. The appellant put the cash in a bag worn around his waist, known colloquially as a bumbag. The appellant then went to 90 Bay Street, Rockdale. After arriving there he was surrounded by police. Sgt Brown took from him the bumbag containing the cash.
The appellant was taken inside the house by the police. Inside the house Sgt
Brown showed him a pistol. The appellant was told that the pistol was his. Sgt
Brown said something along the lines: "You're gone." 
The appellant was then taken to the flat at Brighton. Inside the flat a police officer produced a cylindrical container which the appellant had never seen before. Later at the police premises at Surry Hills the police produced another firearm (the revolver). The appellant had never seen it before but he was told by the police that it was his. After the appellant had been charged with various offences, his property was taken from him. Later some of his property was returned but not the bumbag or the cash which had been in it.

At the trial the appellant alleged that the police had stolen the cash which had been in the bumbag. The appellant called a number of witnesses including his girlfriend, Anna Medley, and Mr Glen Jenkins, the man from whom he had allegedly borrowed the money.

In his summing-up the trial judge said that the issue on the first count was "one of possession", that is whether the Crown had proved that the appellant had been in possession of the drugs. Likewise on the second and third counts, his Honour told the jury that the issue was whether the appellant had been in possession of the firearms.

In his summing-up the trial judge said that the defence case was very simple: "The accused quite simply says and quite directly says that both the drugs and the two firearms were, to use the colloquial expression, 'planted' on him."
The trial judge noted in his summing-up that the Crown relied on admissions allegedly made by the appellant and that the appellant denied that the admissions had been made and that the appellant said that the police officers had perjured themselves and given false evidence.

It is convenient now to turn to the ground of appeal against conviction which was put in the forefront of the written submissions and the oral submissions made on behalf of the appellant. This ground was that the trial judge had erred in refusing to give the jury a warning pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).

The trial judge gave a concise summing-up in which he did not give the jury any warning about the disputed evidence of the alleged admissions. After the conclusion of the summing-up, counsel for the appellant asked the trial judge to give a further direction. In the transcript of the summing-up in the appeal papers, which incorporates the subsequent exchanges between counsel and the trial judge, counsel for the appellant is recorded as saying that he had a copy of "[section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) subsection 1F" of the "Jury Act" and as seeking a "McKinley judgment". The transcript is marked as being a draft and it is obvious that it was never settled. It was accepted on the hearing of the appeal that the statutory provision counsel was referring to was [s (1)(f)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) and that what counsel was applying for was a direction in accordance with McKinney v
The Queen <case>; [(1990-91) 171 CLR 468] and/or a direction in accordance with [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).

In response to a question from the trial judge as to precisely what direction was being sought, counsel for the appellant said that the Crown case depended entirely on the evidence of police officers, that that evidence consisted of (or included) evidence of alleged oral admissions by the appellant, that there was no independent witness to the making of those alleged oral admissions and that in those circumstances the jury should be given a warning to scrutinise the evidence of the police officers carefully.

The Crown Prosecutor then submitted that there was independent evidence of the making of the admissions, that independent evidence being the evidence of the finding of the drugs in the flat at Brighton. Counsel for the appellant pressed his application that the trial judge give a "McKinley judgment" (a
McKinney direction) and the trial judge said: "I will give that direction." 
After the jury had returned to the courtroom, the trial judge told them: "Members of the jury, there is one direction which I did not give to you. I have been persuaded I should give it to you and quite correctly persuaded, and it is this. The Crown case, in a number of respects, depends upon admissions allegedly made to police officers by the accused. He of course disputes having made those admissions.

What I should point out to you is this, those admissions were allegedly made by the accused when he was on his own. Other police were allegedly present.
You should take that into account bearing in mind that in relation to those alleged admissions he had no means of disputing what was allegedly said. There were police there. He was, even on the Crown case, on his own. You should take that into account before acting upon those alleged admissions and satisfy yourselves, if it be the case, that there is some corroboration or some independent evidence of what he then said".

These directions do not fully comply with the directions required to be given in cases where McKinney versus The Queen applies. Counsel for the appellant then said that the direction he had asked for was a direction that the evidence of the alleged admissions might be unreliable and he said that he renewed his application for such a direction. Counsel referred to subs (2) and "the warning in the Act", which were clearly references to [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).

The trial judge declined to say anything further to the jury. The trial judge simply said: "I note the application. I decline to add to the remarks I have already made." The trial judge gave no reason for his decision to refuse the application.
 [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) provides that: "This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable including the following kinds of evidence ...".

The kinds of evidence which are listed in sub-section (1) include: "(a) evidence in relation to which Pt...3.4 (Admissions) applies and "(f) oral evidence of official questioning of a defendant, that is questioning recorded in writing not signed or acknowledged by the defendant." 
It was not disputed on the hearing of this appeal that the evidence by the police officers of the admissions allegedly made by the appellant was evidence to which [Pt .4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.4) of the Act applied and, therefore, within para (a) of subs (1) of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) and was also evidence of questions asked and answers given in the course of official questioning which was recorded in writing (in Det Le Leau's notebook), not signed or acknowledged in writing by the appellant and was, therefore, within para (f) of subs (1) of [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) It was accepted, correctly in my view, that if evidence is of a kind such that it falls within one or more of the paragraphs of subs (1) of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html), then it is evidence to which [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) applies, without the need for any further enquiry into whether the particular evidence may be unreliable.

The further provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) are as follows: "(2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to: warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.

The judge need not comply with subsection(2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.

It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information.

This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury." 
In the present case, as the evidence by the police officers of the making of the disputed oral admissions was evidence to which [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) applied and as there was a jury and as counsel for the appellant had requested a direction in accordance with [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), the trial judge was obliged to give directions in accordance with [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) , unless there were "good reasons for not doing so".

In declining to give the directions asked for, the trial judge did not state any reasons for declining to give the directions. It may be that it is not essential that in all cases in which a judge is of the opinion that there are good reasons for not complying with subs (2) of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) the judge should expressly state what he considers those reasons to be. There is no express requirement in the section itself that the reasons be stated. It may, for example, be quite obvious, in the particular circumstances of an individual case, that evidence which happens to fall within one or other of the paragraphs of subs (1) and is therefore evidence to which [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) applies, is not unreliable. However, in most cases at least, a trial judge should, in my opinion, state what he considers to be the good reasons for not complying with subs (2). The judge's attention will necessarily have been drawn to the matter, because of the need for a request by a party that the directions be given, before any obligation under the section to give the directions arises.

In the present case, the trial judge clearly had not complied with subs (2) of [s 165](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html), either in the principal summing-up or in the further directions he had already given and the trial judge, when requested to give directions in accordance with [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html), peremptorily refused the application without stating any reason for the refusal.

The terms of the transcript of the exchanges between the trial judge and counsel are such that I doubt whether the trial judge addressed the question whether there were good reasons for not complying with subs (2) of [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html)
However, assuming that the trial judge did so and decided that there were good reasons, and even if the power of a trial judge to decide that he need not comply with subs (2) is to be characterised as a discretionary power, I consider that the trial judge erred in law, either in deciding that in the present case there were good reasons for not complying with subs (2) or, alternatively, in not stating what the reasons were which he considered to be good reasons, in a case where it was not obvious that there were good reasons for not complying with subs (2).

In my opinion, in the present case it was not the position that there were good reasons for not complying with subs (2) of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) and a proper consideration of the question raised by ss(3) would have required the conclusion that directions in accordance with subs (2) be given. The evidence in question was evidence of alleged admissions by the appellant in the course of questioning by the police where the only other persons present were police officers. The appellant denied that he had made the admissions. The appellant had declined to sign what purported to be a record of the questioning in a police officer's notebook. The appellant had declined to be interviewed in an electronically recorded interview, except for the purpose of having it recorded that he did not wish to be interviewed.

It was true that there was evidence of the finding of the drugs and of the finding of the firearms but this evidence did not corroborate the making of the disputed admissions, as distinct from being evidence having a tendency to prove the guilt of the appellant and, furthermore, this evidence was given by members of the same group of police officers as gave evidence of the disputed admissions and hence was not evidence independent of the witnesses who had given evidence of the admissions.

It was the appellant's case, as the trial judge stated it in the summing-up, that the drugs and the firearms had been planted on him and had been planted on him as part of the same scheme pursuant to which the evidence of the admissions had been fabricated, that is a scheme to steal the appellant's money and to fabricate evidence of criminal offences by the appellant in the form of evidence of alleged admissions by the appellant and in the form of evidence of the alleged finding of illicit substances in his possession, so as to prevent the appellant complaining, or successfully complaining, about the theft of his money.

A particular matter which might have caused the evidence to be unreliable was that evidence was given by the police officers that the appellant said of eight projectiles which had allegedly been found: "I think they go with the gun I had in my bag." Yet, there was evidence that seven of the eight projectiles did not match either gun allegedly found in the appellant's possession.

The case was a case in which the trial judge had concluded that he should give at least a modified McKinney direction. A further matter is that in his brief summing-up the trial judge had severely criticised counsel for the appellant at the trial because of some of his cross-examination of the police officers.

In my opinion, the appeal against conviction should be upheld on this ground, that the trial judge erred in not giving directions in accordance with [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).

It is also submitted that the trial judge erred in not giving full directions in accordance with McKinney versus The Queen. However, it is unnecessary to consider this submission in the light of the conclusion I have reached that the trial judge erred in not giving directions as required by [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).

Although I have already decided that the appeal against conviction should be upheld, it is appropriate for me to deal with two of the other grounds of appeal against conviction. The first of these grounds was that the trial judge erred in refusing to allow cross-examination of police officers in relation to complaints made against them. As I have already stated, Det Sgt Brown was the highest ranking of the police officers who gave evidence and he was the first of them to give evidence. At an early stage of the cross-examination of Det
Sgt Brown, counsel for the appellant at the trial was permitted, without objection and without any intervention by the trial judge, to put to Brown that a number of complaints had been made against him about his conduct as a police officer. Brown agreed that a number of complaints had been made against him but said that none of the complaints had been substantiated.

Later in the cross-examination, it was put to Brown, without objection, that his name had been mentioned at the police Royal Commission by a number of witnesses. After a number of further questions about things which had allegedly happened at the Royal Commission, Brown was asked which of two persons named Bayeh had made allegations at the Royal Commission that Brown had tried to "set him up". At this point, the trial judge intervened: "Mr
Coorey, (counsel for the accused) what is the relevance?" His Honour asked how it would assist the jury for counsel to put to the witness that some person in some other inquiry or proceeding had made allegations against the witness.
Counsel for the appellant said that the witness might admit that a complaint against him was true, although counsel did not expect the witness to make such an admission. Counsel also said that the jury might not accept the witness's denial. Counsel was permitted to ask a further question. The transcript then continues: "Q. Right. But the complaint is that you only charged him because you were trying to protect another drug dealer, a man named Con, that's the allegation.

Q. Were you receiving moneys in any way in relation to Mr Bayeh? 
HIS HONOUR: I reject the question.

COOREY: Q. Were you involved in any plan to fabricate evidence against Mr
Bayeh? 
HIS HONOUR: I reject the question.

COOREY: Q. Were you accused by a witness described as KX11 of being involved with drugs? 
HIS HONOUR: I reject the question.

COOREY: Q. Did you ever receive moneys from Mr Bayeh or any person associated with him, in relation to anything to do with drugs? 
HIS HONOUR: I reject the question. There's no relevance Mr Coorey.

COOREY: Q. Detective, did you, in a case with officers known as Landy and
Young, seize $30,000 out of the possession of a Mr Leon Thiess? 
HIS HONOUR: I reject the question.

COOREY: Q. Did you and other police seize the sum of $14,000 from a Mr Craig
Allan Wright? 
HIS HONOUR: Yes, I reject the question. Can we deal with this present case Mr
Coorey?" 
On the hearing of this appeal, evidence was admitted in the form of an affidavit by counsel for the appellant at the trial of the further related questions counsel would have asked if the last two questions had not been disallowed.

On this appeal it was accepted that the questions about what was the nature of a complaint that had been made at the Royal Commission and whether some witness at the Royal Commission had made an accusation of improper conduct as a police officer against the witness were objectionable and had been rightly rejected by the trial judge. However, it was submitted that at least the last two questions which were disallowed were proper questions and that the trial judge had erred in rejecting them.

The trial judge appears to have rejected the questions on the ground that they were irrelevant and did not relate to the present case. However, in my opinion, an affirmative answer to either of the questions would have related to the credibility of the witness. Under [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s55.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), evidence is not taken to be irrelevant only because it relates only to the credibility of a witness. There is no need for evidence which is capable of affecting the credibility of a witness to be evidence about the facts in issue in the proceeding in which the witness is giving evidence. Under [Pt .7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.7) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), there is a general rule that evidence which is relevant only to a witness's credibility is not admissible but this rule does not apply to evidence adduced in cross- examination, if the evidence has substantial probative value. In my opinion, an admission made by the witness in an answer to either of the questions I am now dealing with would have had substantial probative value on the question of the witness's credibility and the fact that the witness might have been unlikely to make any such admission did not affect the admissibility of the questions.

I am also of the opinion that the questions, being questions whether the witness had on other occasions as a police officer in the company of other police officers illicitly seized sums of money, were relevant within [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s55.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). Any admission in answer to either of those questions could rationally have affected the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings, namely, whether Brown had illicitly seized money of the appellant's, the existence of that fact being capable of rendering it more probable that the evidence against the appellant had been fabricated.

In written submissions, counsel for the Crown did not really seek to uphold his Honour's rejection of the questions on the ground given by his Honour, that is that the questions were irrelevant. It was, however, submitted that the questions were unduly annoying, offensive and repetitive within [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s41.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) and that, having regard to the answers already given by the witness, were unlikely to elicit any evidence of any value to the appellant.

A difficulty with these submissions is that the trial judge did not purport to be exercising the power conferred by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s41.html) when he disallowed the questions. Furthermore, a judge should be slow to reject an otherwise admissible question on the ground that the judge anticipates that the answer the witness will give will not assist the questioner's case. I do not consider that the questions were unduly annoying, offensive or repetitive and, in my opinion, they should have been allowed. I would uphold this ground of appeal too, although if this was the only ground of appeal on which the appellant had succeeded, a serious question would have arisen as to whether the proviso in <case> of the Criminal Appeal Act should have been applied.

The only other ground of appeal it is necessary to refer to is the ground that the verdicts of the jury were unsafe and unsatisfactory. It is the only ground which, if established, would entitle the appellant to have the verdicts of guilty quashed absolutely, as distinct from having a new trial ordered.

The principles to be applied by the Court of Criminal Appeal in deciding whether a verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory were dealt with authoritatively by the High Court in M versus The Queen [(1994) 181 CLR 487.] 
Having made my own independent examination of the evidence, I consider it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of all three offences and I do not experience a doubt about the guilt of the appellant of the kind referred to by the High Court in M. Six police officers gave evidence. The drugs and the two firearms and other objects which the police said had been found in either the premises at
Rockdale or the premises at Brighton were produced at the trial and became exhibits. The appellant did not give sworn evidence. It was a case in which the advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the evidence given was important. Although some weaknesses in the Crown evidence as recorded in the transcript were suggested, these weaknesses were not such as to lead me to have a doubt of the kind referred to in M.

I would propose that the appeals against conviction on the three counts be allowed, that the convictions be quashed but that there be a new trial on all three counts.

GROVE J: I agree.

HAMILTON AJ: I also agree.

GROVE J: The orders of the court, therefore, will be as proposed by James J.
