JUDGMENT (EX TEMPORE)
By interlocutory process filed 4 March 2014, in proceedings 2003/85453 in respect of Valusi Proprietary Limited (in liquidation), and in proceedings 2001/58773 in respect of FAI Investments Proprietary Limited (in liquidation), the liquidators of the HIH Group seek orders concerning the final distribution of assets in the respective liquidations and approval of their remuneration, with a view to the ultimate deregistration of each company, and the release of the liquidators after the final winding up steps are taken. 
This application is the seventh in a series of similar applications regarding companies in the HIH Group which have previously considered by Barrett J, as his Honour then was, in FAI Car Owners Mutual Insurance Company Proprietary Limited <case>; [(2009) 262 ALR 552], and later decisions. Two issues arise in the present application that have not been addressed and considered in the judgments given at earlier stages, on which I shall comment in due course. 
In respect of Valusi, the liquidators seek a direction pursuant to (Cth) [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 479(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s479.html), that they are justified in making an in specie distribution and assignment of the right of the company to prove in the liquidation of United Body Works Queensland Proprietary Limited in the sum of $1,500,000 to three creditors of the company, by entering into a deed of assignment in a form that is in evidence. Valusi's only asset of significance is its right to prove in the liquidation of United Body Works. It has two creditors, HIH Casualty and General Insurance and FAI General Insurance Company, both of which are in liquidation, subject to schemes of arrangement, and are also companies in the HIH Group. The applicant liquidators are also their liquidators. In other words, what is proposed is, instead of awaiting the realisation and liquidation of United Body Works, the right to prove in that liquidation is to be transferred to the creditors jointly.
One novel issue that arises is that what is proposed is the transfer of a debt due to the company to multiple creditors. As is pointed out in Marcus Smith QC and Nico Leslie, The Law of Assignment, (2nd ed 2013, Oxford University Press) at 49, generally it is not possible to divide up a single right and then separately assign the parts. This is because a debt is regarded as indivisible, so that an assignment by way of division is not possible as to do so would create multiple debts which would increase the legal burden of the debtor. See also G J Tolhurst, and Elizabeth Peden, Commercial Issues in Contract Law: Papers from the Commercial Law Quarterly 20th Anniversary Conference, (2008) chapter 4.
If the debt were to be divided pro rata to the claims of the two creditors, and assigned in two parts in that way, that principle would be offended. In order to avoid that consequence, what is proposed is that the debt be assigned to the two creditors jointly, who have as between them agreed to lodge a single proof of debt in the liquidation, but upon receipt of a dividend to direct payment pro rata according to their various entitlements. This it seems to me an entirely acceptable way of addressing the situation.
I am satisfied that the remuneration claimed of $25,367 plus GST to 1 November 2013 and a further $9,710 until deregistration is reasonable. For reasons explained in previous judgments, non-compliance with the publication requirements of regulation 5.6.65 ought not invalidate the proposed declaration of a final dividend, since given the publication that has taken place to date and the notoriety of this liquidation, it is improbable in the extreme that any other creditor would now emerge.
In respect of FAI Investments, a direction is sought that the liquidators are justified in distributing in specie 14,999,999 shares held by the company in FAI (NZ) General Insurance Company Limited, a New Zealand company, to its three creditors pro rata, and also in assigning to the three creditors pro rata, to their admitted liabilities, the rights of the company to prove in the liquidation of three other companies in the FAI Group.
So far as the assignment of the rights to prove in the other liquidations is concerned, the observations I have made in respect of the assignment of a single debt to one or multiple creditors are equally applicable.
So far as the shareholding in the New Zealand company is concerned, (NZ) Companies Act 1993, <case>(d), provides that, with effect from the commencement of a liquidation of a company, unless a court orders otherwise, a share in the company must not be transferred. The liquidator of the New Zealand company has agreed in a document which I will admit as AX101, to apply to the New Zealand court for the transfer of the shares in question, and also that if any of the creditors to whom they are to be transferred are deregistered before the transfers are effected, then to transfer the respective number of shares at the direction of that creditor.
While the transfer will not be able to take place until the New Zealand court has made the requisite order, it seems to me, on the basis of the New Zealand liquidators' agreement, that the liquidators will be justified in distributing the shares in that manner once the New Zealand order is obtained.
In the case of FAI Investments, I am satisfied that the remuneration of $23,815.51 to 1 November 2013 plus GST and a further $9,710 until deregistration is reasonable. As in previous cases, an application for the court's approval is made without having previously approached any creditors meeting, in circumstances where the only creditors are companies in the HIH Group, and for reasons given on the earlier applications, that is an appropriate course. To the extent that they are liquidators of contributories and creditors, the liquidators consent to the claim. The amount is supported by comprehensive reports from the liquidators setting out the work done in each case.
