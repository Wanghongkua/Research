JUDGMENT (EX TEMPORE)
HIS HONOUR: The company Paris Ricki Pty Limited was wound up by order of the Court made on 29 November 2013. By application filed on 24 February 2015, its sole director Malcolm Downie applies for an order terminating the winding up. The evidence establishes that the winding up appears to have resulted from the failure of those of the registered office to inform the controlling minds of the company of the service of the documents that initiated the winding up process. The evidence establishes that the company is amply solvent and that, as a result of the orders proposed to be made, the only creditor will be paid in full and the liquidator's remuneration will also be paid.
The liquidator's remuneration has not yet been approved, and the Court is asked to approve that remuneration. The difficulty is that (Cth) [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 473(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s473.html), has the effect of requiring that, before the Court can approve remuneration, the creditors must be given an opportunity to do so at a meeting of creditors, and that such a meeting must be convened in accordance with [s 473(4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s473.html) As Drummond J said in Re Interchase Corporation Ltd (in prov liq) <case>; [(1993) 11 ACSR 569] (at 574): 
Before the Court can act under [s (3)(b)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s473.html) the liquidator must first have acted in accordance with [s (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s473.html) to convene a meeting of creditors for the purpose of fixing his remuneration.
If no creditor attends either in person or by proxy, or if a meeting actually takes place but the prescribed resolution is not passed, the pre-condition to the court being empowered to act will be satisfied. But unless that occurs the court, in my opinion, has no power to fix the liquidator's remuneration.
In this case, a meeting has been convened for Monday 27 April, and the requisite notice sent to the only creditor. That creditor has communicated that it agrees to the remuneration sought in the amount of $58,864.85. It is improbable, if the creditor is paid out as a result of these orders, that it will be bothered to attend a meeting on 27 April, and it can be foreseen that it is unlikely that such a resolution will then be passed.
However, I think the better view is that the doctrine of unanimous assent can be taken to apply when the sole creditor has indicated, albeit in advance of the meeting, that it agrees to the proposed remuneration. Accordingly, it can be taken that there is a resolution of creditors for the purposes of [s 473(3)(b)(i).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s473.html)
The liquidator consents to the orders proposed.
The Court orders that: * (1) The winding up of Paris Ricki Pty Limited (in liquidation) ACN 089 935 099 ("the company") be terminated on and from 21 April 2015.

These orders are to be entered forthwith.
