JUDGMENT
In February or March 2014 the Plaintiff made a claim on the Fidelity Fund of the Law Society in relation to properties he had bought and sold in 1997. He had engaged the services at that time of a solicitor Michael Damianos. The Plaintiff claimed that the solicitor failed to account to him in relation to the sale and purchase of the properties.
On 17 July 2014 the Fidelity Fund Management Committee considered the material provided by the Plaintiff and resolved as follows: 
RESOLVED 
To refuse to allow further time on the grounds, and for the reasons, set out below. 
Triable issue 
Grounds: 
There is no triable issue of failure to account by Mr Damianos in relation to the proceeds of sale of 3 properties, being 17A Beatrice Street, Hurstville sold by Frank Shalhoub, 6/35-39 Judd Street, Cronulla sold by Julian Shalhoub and 15/35-39 Judd Street, Cronulla sold by Sammy Shalhoub. 
Reasons: 
The 3 properties were sold in October and November 1997. The claimants received no paperwork from Mr Damianos regarding the sales. Mr F Shalhoub stated that in 2007-08 he was advised that Mr Damianos' instruction files for the sales could not be located. The Receiver no longer retains any of Mr
Damianos' instruction files. After 16 years, the proceeds of sale cannot be traced to establish their application. 
Excessive delay 
Reasons: 
The delay is excessive in notifying the Society. 
Grounds: 
The 3 properties were sold in October and November 1997. On this basis, the notification is about 16 years late. 
No satisfactory explanation  
Reasons: 
There is no satisfactory explanation for the delay in notifying the
Society. 
Grounds: 
This excessive delay has not been adequately explained by the claimants. Mr
F Shalhoub was requested to advise what steps they took in the 10 years 1997 to 2007 regarding their sale proceeds but have pointed to none. Mr F Shalhoub states that he contacted a lady (apparently the Receiver, Miss Sayer, or a member of her staff) in 2007-2008 who was unable to locate the sale files. No other steps have been identified until 2014 when Mr F Shalhoub contacted the
Office of the Legal Services Commissioner, which directed him to the Society. 
Striking a balance 
Reasons: 
Upon striking a fair balance of the competing interests, it would not be just to allow the claim to proceed. 
Grounds: 
The prejudice to the Society overrides the public interest in the claim being determined at this stage.
On 12 August 2015 the Plaintiff filed a Statement of Claim against the Law Society claiming these orders: . An order pursuant to [Section
D(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s90d.html) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) granting the Plaintiff leave to make a claim against the fidelity fund maintained by the defendant out of time.  . An order that the defendant's decision dated 17 July 2014 refusing the plaintiff's claim against the fidelity fund be set aside.  . An order that the defendant pay the Plaintiff the sum of $745 000.00 by way of compensation out of the Fidelity Fund.
On 3 March 2016 the Law Society filed a Notice of Motion seeking orders that the Statement of Claim be struck out, alternatively, that the proceedings be dismissed pursuant to r 13.4 [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) . On the same day the Plaintiff filed a Notice of Motion seeking leave to file an Amended Statement of Claim in the form annexed to the Notice of Motion. The relief claimed in the proposed Amended Statement of Claim was as follows: . A declaration that the Defendant failed to determine the Plaintiffs' claim pursuant to [Section
D(3)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s90d.html) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/).  . A declaration that the Defendant's failure to determine the Plaintiffs' claim under [Section
D(3)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s90d.html) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) is an appealable decision.  . Appeal allowed.  . An order that the Defendant's decision dated 17 July 2014 refusing the plaintiff's claim against the fidelity fund be set aside.  . An order pursuant to [Section
D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s90d.html) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) that the defendant pay the Plaintiffs the sum of $1,383,000.00 by way of compensation out of the Fidelity Fund.  . An order that the defendant pay interest on that sum from 1 January to date and continuing.  . In the alternative, an order pursuant to [Section (7)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s80.html) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) extending the time in which the Plaintiff can make a claim against the
Fidelity Fund.  . Further in the alternative, an order pursuant to either [Section (4)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s87.html) or [Section (2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s88.html) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) extending the time in which the Plaintiffs can make a claim against the
Fidelity Fund.  . In the alternative, an order that the Plaintiffs' claim be determined on its merits by the Defendant pursuant to [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s80.html) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/).
This judgment concerns both of those Notices of Motion.
Subsequent to the filing of the Motions the Plaintiff, in answer to a letter from the Law Society seeking particulars of the proposed Amended Statement of Claim, indicated that further changes were to be made to that document and enclosed a further proposed Amended Statement of Claim. That document, which was an annexure to the affidavit of David Paul Courtenay said to have been sworn on 9 March 2016 but apparently sworn on 11 March 2016, amended the monetary amount in prayer 5 to $943,000 and the date in prayer 6 to 1 January 2000. There were two amendments to the pleading. The second is of some significance for the present Motions. It concerns particular (a) under paragraph 15 and I will mention it when dealing with the pleading.
Somewhat unsatisfactorily there was no affidavit from the Plaintiff setting out the background to the claim on the Fidelity Fund. The parties appeared content to work on the basis that what was contained in the Statement of Claim and the proposed (further) Amended Statement of Claim (hereafter referred to as "the Amended Statement of Claim") supplemented by factual material in the Defendant's submissions formed the basis upon which the Motions were to be determined. In this regard, it should be noted that the proposed Amended Statement of Claim is seriously deficient in a number of respects. It does not clearly set out the factual basis upon which the claim on the Fidelity Fund was made and there is a general vagueness in relation to dates that are of significance for the purposes of the [Legal Profession Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) .
The background can be summarised as follows.
In November 1996 the Plaintiff acquired land in Folio Identifier 2/863092 being 17A Beatrice Street, Hurstville for an amount of $105,000. He sold this land on about 17 October 1997 for $320,000.
On 21 November 1997 Julian Shalhoub purchased the property in Folio Identifier 6/SP55783 being Unit 6, 35 Judge Street, Cronulla for $188,000. At some time it was sold for $210,000.
On 26 November 1997 Sammy Shalhoub purchased the property in Folio Identifier 15/SP55783 being Unit 15, 35 Judge Street, Cronulla for $188,000. It was sold for $215,000.
A fourth property being the property in Certificate of Title Volume 5333 Folio 18 was either bought or sold by the Plaintiff or one of his sons. The matter is not made clear in the pleading. It seems that no claim has yet been made on the Fidelity Fund in relation to this property. In the letter earlier referred to at [6] the solicitors for the Plaintiff accepted that a claim must first be made before this property can form part of the present proceedings.
Mr Damianos is said to have acted for the Plaintiff and his sons in relation to these properties but it is not said on which precise transactions he acted. According to the pleading Mr Damianos was instructed to act and there was one further contact between him and the Plaintiff when he informed the Plaintiff that everything was fine. That was the last contact the Plaintiff had with Mr Damianos. The pleading then says in paragraph 10: 
The Plaintiff has never received any of the sale proceeds from the sales of any of the properties and was not able to locate [Mr Damianos].
The pleading then makes reference to the Plaintiff's limited education and work. It also provides some information about his poor health from 2003 to 2010.
Paragraph 15 then pleads: 
The Plaintiff has attempted to contact the Defendant a number of times since but he did not receive any assistance from the Defendant about what he could do about MD's failure to account to him for the sale proceeds of the properties.
The particulars under that paragraph relevantly read: a) The Plaintiff first contacted the Defendant about MD and his failure to account to him for the sale proceedings during 1999. He was not advised by
The Defendant did not advise the Plaintiff to make a claim on the Fidelity
Fund at this time. He was only informed that MD was out of business. The
Plaintiff believes that he spoke to Jean Sayer (JS) at this time.  b) The Plaintiff then contacted the Defendant in about 2003 on another matter and again enquired about MD, his disappearance and his failure to account to the Plaintiff for the proceeds of the sales of the three properties. On this occasion the Plaintiff recalls being told by the Defendant that MD was bankrupt and to forget about it. The Defendant did not advise the
Plaintiff to make a claim on the Fidelity Fund at this time.  c) The Plaintiff then contacted the Defendant in about 2007 and spoke to JS again. The Plaintiff again informed JS about the fact that MD had disappeared and never accounted to him for the sale of the three properties. JS initially could not find any records of the sales of the properties, but the records were subsequently found. It was at about this time that the Plaintiff was informed that MD had been struck off. The Defendant did not advise the
Plaintiff to make a claim on the Fidelity Fund at this time.

The time referred to in bold in (a) above previously read (in the first form of the proposed Amended Statement of Claim) "in about 1998". This change means an even longer period after any failure to account by Mr Damianos before any contact was made with the Law Society, as is alleged.
Subsequent to the service of the Statement of Claim correspondence ensued between the solicitors for the parties. Some matters pointed out by the solicitor for the Law Society appear to have brought about the proposal by the Plaintiff to amend the Statement of Claim. In particular the proposal is that the Plaintiff's son Julian Shalhoub be added as a second plaintiff, seemingly, because one of the properties was bought and sold by him. On the other hand, there is no explanation for why Sammy Shalhoub has not been added as a Plaintiff when one of the properties was purchased and sold by him.
The prior explanation for the Plaintiff alone making the claim was that all of the funds were provided by him including for the purchase of properties in the two sons' names. However, whether because the Plaintiff now accepts that the doctrine of advancement would operate on any resulting trust arising from the provision of funds to the sons or for some other reason, Julian has been added as a Plaintiff. It is hard to see why there is any distinction between Julian and Sammy whereby Julian has been added as a plaintiff but Sammy has not.
One of the matters pointed out in the correspondence by the solicitor for the Law Society concerned [s 80(7)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s80.html) of the [Legal Profession Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/). That appears to have brought about the relief sought in paragraph of the proposed Amended Statement of Claim but not the abandonment of the relief formerly in prayer 1 of the Statement of Claim and now found in prayers 1, 2 and 5 of the proposed Amended Statement of Claim.

Submissions
The Defendant submitted that the relief sought in the existing Statement of Claim and in all but prayer 7 of the proposed Amended Statement of Claim was misconceived. This was because the Fidelity Fund had not refused or denied the Plaintiff's claim. Rather, it had refused to allow further time to make the claim pursuant to the provisions of [s 80(7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s80.html) of the Act. The Defendant submitted that all the Plaintiff could seek from this Court at the present time was an order giving leave to make the claim out of time pursuant to [s 80(7)(d).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s80.html)
In relation to the relief sought under [s 87(4)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s87.html) or [s 88(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s88.html) of the Act, the Defendant said that the time for that relief had not yet arrived. Moreover, [s 88(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s88.html) was concerned with dishonest default and nothing was pleaded to suggest that there was such a default as defined in [s 79B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s79b.html) of the Act.
The Plaintiff submitted that the Fidelity Fund had refused the claim giving the Plaintiff the right to appeal to the Supreme Court under [s 90D(3).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s90d.html) If in fact it was correct to say that the Fidelity Fund had not considered the claim then the Plaintiff's rights lay under [s 90D(3)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s90d.html) because of the failure by the Council to determine the claim within the prescribed time.
The Plaintiff submitted that [s 63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s63.html) of the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) gives power to the Court to enable it to grant the relief that is contained in the proposed Amended Statement of Claim.

Legislation
Although the [Legal Profession Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) was repealed by the [Legal Profession Act 2004](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lpa2004179/) the parties agree that this matter is governed by the 1987 Act because the failure to account is said to have occurred prior to the repeal of that Act. Clause 22A of Schedule 9 (Savings, transitional and other provisions) to the 2004 Act appears to enable the present proceedings to be brought under either Act. The provisions under consideration are relevantly identical. I shall discuss the matter relying on the provisions of the 1987 Act.
The Act relevantly provides: 
A Meaning of "failure to account" 
In this Division, a reference to a failure to account is a reference to a failure by a solicitor to account for, pay or deliver money or other valuable property received by, or entrusted to, the solicitor or an associate in the course of the solicitor's practice (in the case of an associate, being money or valuable property under the direct or indirect control of the solicitor). 
This section applies only to a failure to account that arises from an act or omission of the solicitor or associate: for which the solicitor or associate has been convicted of a crime or an offence involving dishonesty, or  which the Law Society Council has found to be dishonest.

A finding by the Law Society Council under subsection (2) (b) that an act or omission is, or is not, dishonest is final and conclusive. 
This section applies whether the money or other property was received by the solicitor or associate as trustee, agent, bailee or stakeholder or in any other capacity. 
This section applies whether the failure to account, or the act, omission, conviction or finding of dishonesty, took place before or after the commencement of this Act. 
B Meaning of "dishonest default" 
In this Division, a reference to a dishonest default is a reference to a dishonest act or omission (other than a failure to account) by the solicitor in the course of the solicitor's practice, but only if: a final judgment debt has been obtained against the solicitor as a result of the dishonest act or omission, and  the judgment debt is not fully satisfied.

A dishonest act or omission is an act or omission: for which the solicitor has been convicted of a crime or an offence involving dishonesty, or  which a State or Commonwealth Court has, in the course of delivering a final judgment, found to be dishonest, or  which the Tribunal has found to be dishonest in connection with a final determination of the Tribunal.

A judgment debt is fully satisfied if the solicitor provides adequate security to cover the relevant judgment debt or pays the relevant judgment debt by agreed instalments. 
This division does not apply to a dishonest default unless the relevant judgment debt remains unsatisfied for at least 3 months after it was obtained (or an agreed instalment remains unpaid for at least 3 months after it was due to be paid).  ...  Claims against Fidelity Fund 
The Fidelity Fund is held, and is to be applied, by the Law Society for the purpose of compensating persons who suffer pecuniary loss because of a failure to account or a dishonest default. 
Without limiting subsection (1), a claim lies against the Fidelity
Fund for the purpose of compensating persons who suffer pecuniary loss: occurring wholly in this State from a failure to account or a dishonest default (whether or not in the course of practising in this or another State) of a solicitor who is a local legal practitioner or a contributing interstate legal practitioner, or  occurring both in this State and in another State or a Territory from a failure to account or a dishonest default (whether or not in the course of practising in this or another State) of a solicitor who is a local legal practitioner, or  occurring both in this State and in another State or a Territory from a failure to account or a dishonest default (in the course of practising in this
State) of a solicitor who is a contributing interstate legal practitioner, or  occurring in this State or another State or a Territory, or both, in circumstances in which it cannot be determined precisely where the loss occurred, from a failure to account or a dishonest default (whether or not in the course of practising in this or another State) of a solicitor who is a local legal practitioner, or  occurring in this State or in another State or a Territory, or both, in circumstances in which it cannot be determined precisely where the loss occurred, from a failure to account or a dishonest default (in the course of practising in this State) of a solicitor who is a contributing interstate legal practitioner, or  in any other circumstances in which an agreement or arrangement under section 48ZC provides that a claim is payable.

Without limiting subsection (1), a claim lies against the Fidelity Fund for the purpose of compensating persons who suffer pecuniary loss occurring wholly in this State from a failure to account or a dishonest default (whether or not in this State) of a locally registered foreign lawyer who has paid a contribution required to be paid in accordance with regulations under section
A. 
A claim against the Fidelity Fund is to be made in writing in the form approved by the Law Society. 
If a claim is made against the Fidelity Fund, the Law Society Council must: investigate the claim, and  determine the claim by wholly or partly allowing, compromising, settling or disallowing it.

If a solicitor has failed to account or made a dishonest default, the
Law Society Council may wholly or partly disallow a claim: if satisfied that the claim does not have sufficient connection with practice as a New South Wales solicitor in Australia (for example, because the claim arises from the receipt or entrustment of money or valuable property that was received by or entrusted to a solicitor outside Australia and the act or omission giving rise to the claim occurred outside Australia), or  if the person who made the claim knowingly assisted in or contributed towards, or was a party or accessory to, the act or omission from which the failure to account or dishonest default arose, or  if satisfied that the negligence of the person who made the claim contributed to the loss, or  if satisfied that the conduct of the transaction with the solicitor was illegal, and the person who made the claim knew or ought reasonably to have known of that illegality, or  if satisfied that proper and usual records were not brought into existence during the conduct of the transaction (or were destroyed), and the person who made the claim knew or ought reasonably to have known that such records would not be kept or would be destroyed.

Subsection (4) does not limit the Law Society Council's power to otherwise disallow a claim. 
A person is not prevented from making a claim just because, after the act or omission by a solicitor from which the failure to account or the dishonest default arises, the solicitor: being a natural person, dies or ceases to be a legal practitioner or interstate legal practitioner, or  (Repealed)  ceases to practice as a solicitor, or  ceases to hold a current practising certificate or interstate practising certificate.

If the amount of a claim against the Fidelity Fund does not exceed $2,500 or such other amount as may be prescribed, the Law Society Council may allow the claim after waiving compliance with such of the provisions of this
Division as it thinks fit. 
A claim does not lie against the Fidelity Fund unless the prospective claimant notifies the Law Society of the failure to account or dishonest default: in the case of failure to account--not later than 3 months after the prospective claimant becomes aware of the failure, or  in the case of dishonest default--not later than 3 months after the prospective claimant becomes aware that there has been a failure to satisfy the relevant judgment debt for the period required before a claim can be made, or  if the Law Society Council allows further time after the period of 3 months referred to in paragraph (a) or (b)--within the further time allowed, or  if the Supreme Court allows further time after the Law Society Council refuses to do so--within the time allowed by the Supreme Court.

Note. There are constraints on the making of claims against the Fidelity
Fund in respect of certain mortgage work carried out by solicitors. See Part ...  Final date for making claim on failure to account 
If the Law Society Council considers that there has been, or may have been, a failure to account by a solicitor, it may publish a notice in the form approved by the Attorney General that fixes a final date on or before which claims relating to the failure to account must be made. 
The final date fixed by the notice for making a claim must be a date that is at least 3 months later than the first or only publication of the notice. 
The notice must be published: in a newspaper published and circulating in the district in which the solicitor is, or was, practising or carrying on business, and  in a newspaper published and circulating in Sydney.

A claim arising from a failure to account and made after the final date fixed by the notice is barred unless: the Law Society Council allows further time, or  the Supreme Court allows further time, if the Law Society Council refuses to do so.
 ... 
The Law Society may, after such date as it may fix in each case, pay from the Fidelity Fund successful claims arising from a failure to account.  Final date for making claim on dishonest default 
If the Law Society Council considers that there has been, or may have been, a dishonest default by a solicitor, it may give to any prospective claimant a copy of the approved claim form and notification of the date (being not less than 3 months) by which the claim must be made. 
A claim arising from dishonest default by a solicitor and made after the date so notified to the claimant is barred unless: the Law Society Council allows further time, or  the Supreme Court allows further time, if the Law Society refuses to do so.

The Law Society may, after such date as it may fix in each case, pay from the Fidelity Fund successful claims arising from a dishonest default.  ... 
D Proceedings against Law Society 
An action does not lie against the Law Society in relation to the
Fidelity Fund except: with the leave of the Law Society Council, or  as provided by this section.

If the Law Society Council wholly or partly disallows a claim, it must (without delay) give written notice of the disallowance to the claimant. 
A claimant may appeal to the Supreme Court against: a decision by the Law Society Council to wholly or partly disallow a claim, or  a decision by the Law Society Council to reduce the amount allowed in respect of a claim, by virtue of section 80A, or  a failure by the Law Society Council to determine a claim within such period as is prescribed by the regulations.

On an appeal under this section, the Supreme Court may make such order as it thinks fit. 
If the Law Society Council wholly or partly disallows a claim relating to a failure to account in respect of which a solicitor or an associate has been convicted of an offence involving dishonesty: the claimant may take proceedings in the Supreme Court as for a debt due by the Law Society, and  in any such proceedings, the defences that would have been available to the solicitor are available to the Law Society.

Any such claimant may take proceedings instead under subsection (3).

Consideration
The Plaintiff does not seek to maintain the original Statement of Claim filed. The single issue for determination on the Plaintiff's Motion was whether the Plaintiff or Plaintiffs should be entitled to file an Amended Statement of Claim seeking relief other than an order under <case>(d) of the Act.
No particular arguments were addressed to the form of the pleading which, as I have noted earlier, is somewhat deficient. Moreover, a number of matters pleaded could not be said to be material facts within the meaning of the Rules. Some of the paragraphs detailing the medical condition of the Plaintiff and others ought to be particulars. On the other hand, dates of notification of the Law Society would seem to me to be material facts if the Plaintiffs are seeking an order under <case>(d) to justify further time being allowed.
The evidence of what was decided by the Fidelity Fund is clear. It was not a disallowance of the claim. It was a refusal to allow further time after the period of three months to notify the Law Society of the claim.
Section 80 governs the making of the claim and the basis for allowing and disallowing a claim. The section contains its own limitation provision in sub-s (7). That sub-section is a gateway provision. A claim does not lie against the Fund unless it is made in the time stipulated or in any further period allowed by either the Law Society Council or by this Court.
The appeal provisions in <case> are only available where there has been a decision by the Law Society Council to wholly or partly disallow a claim, to reduce the amount allowed by virtue of <case> or where there is a failure to determine the claim within the time. If a claim does not lie under <case>, there is no claim either to determine or to disallow.
In Fincorp Investments Limited versus Trazmar Pty Limited <case> a claim was made on the Fidelity Fund by Trazmar Pty Ltd but the claim was not made within the statutory time limit. The matter was governed by the [Legal Profession Act 2004](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lpa2004179/) . There was some doubt about whether the 1987 Act or the 2004 Act applied but Schmidt J noted at [6] that it was common ground between the parties that the provisions of the two Acts were relevantly the same. I am satisfied from my examination of the two Acts, as noted earlier, that the provisions of the two Acts are relevantly the same. In that case, Trazmar said that it had a right of appeal under <case> of the 2004 Act (the equivalent of <case> of the 1987 Act) because the Law Society had both refused an extension of time under <case>(b) (the equivalent of <case>(c) of the 1987 Act) and also determined the claim on the merits.
The notification by the Law Society was that the application for the extension of time had been refused. Grounds were given for the refusal of the extension of time. Reasons were then provided which concluded with the following: 
The Committee indicated, for the benefit of the claimants, that had it allowed further time, it would, nevertheless, have wholly disallowed the claim. While the Committee may have concluded that there had been failure to account or default in relation to the title deeds in question, the following matters would have lead the Committee to disallow the claim:- ...
Trazmar pointed to those reasons to argue that the claim had been considered on its merits. It may be seen, therefore, that Fincorp was a stronger case for the claimant to argue that there had been a disallowance of the claim and not just a refusal to permit the claim to be brought out of time.
Justice Schmidt said: [33] ... The reasons given included an explanation that one of the reasons for the refusal of the extension application, was the view reached as to the merits of the claim. That was plainly a relevant consideration. After all, there would be no point in granting an extension in respect of a potentially worthless application. There was, nevertheless, neither a decision, nor even a purported decision made by the Law Society, as to the merits of Trazmar's claim. Nor was it advised that such a decision had been made.  [34] That approach was consistent with the statutory scheme, which did not empower the Law Society to determine the merits of a claim which was time barred.  [35] On the face of the relevant minutes recording the Law Society's decision, no decision was purported to be made as to the merits of the claim.
The reasons given as to the merits, supported the decision to refuse the extension of time application. That approach is consistent with the scheme of the Act. At the time that Trazmar first approached the Law Society in 2009, a claim did not lie under the 2004 Act in respect of the alleged default, because: 
Firstly, it had not made a claim within the time specified in <case> and had sought no extension of that time, with the result that the claim was barred (see <case> (2)) ; and 
Secondly, it had not made a claim within the extended period which flowed from the operation of <case>, given the Law Society's advertisement under s ...  [39] It follows that, despite the advice Trazmar received from the Law
Society as to its views of the merits of the claim, the fact remains that on the proper construction of the 2004 Act, the Law Society had no power to make any decision as to the merits of Trazmar's claim, the application for an extension of time having been refused. In the result, there can be no appeal brought to this Court under <case> in respect of the merits of the claim. Such an appeal depends on the Law Society having made a decision under <case>, either to wholly or partly disallow Trazmar's claim, or to reduce the amount allowed in respect of its claim. Under this statutory scheme, a decision which rests on other grounds, such as those provided in <case>, for example, does not give rise to a right to appeal (see <case>).  [40] The Law Society having refused to exercise the discretion it was given by <case>(b) to allow Trazmar further time to bring its claim, it has no power to determine the merits of the claim, unless its refusal is successfully appealed to this Court under <case>(c). Until that occurs, Trazmar's claim is barred. It is not entitled to have the claim investigated by the Law
Society under <case>; to have it determined by the Law Society under <case>; or to have any payment made to it out of the Fidelity Fund. Such payments are governed by the provisions of <case>, which provides: Payments for defaults 
The Fidelity Fund is to be applied by the Law Society Council for the purpose of compensating claimants in respect of claims allowed under this Part in respect of defaults to which this Part applies. 
An amount payable from the Fidelity Fund in respect of a claim is payable to the claimant or to another person at the claimant's direction.
 [41] To construe <case> of the Act as obliging the Law Society to investigate a claim which is barred, does not accord with the purpose of the Act. If the claim is barred, it is one which an applicant has no right to pursue under s
On the proper construction of this statutory scheme, only claims in respect of alleged default which are not time barred, need be investigated by the Law Society.
I entirely agree, with respect, with the reasons of Schmidt J. Further, they are entirely applicable to the statutory scheme under the 1987 Act which is relevantly the same as that under the 2004 Act.
The Plaintiff submitted, however, that Schmidt J's attention had not been drawn to [s 63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s63.html) of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) nor to the first instance decision of Greg James J in Glenorcy Pty Limited versus Law Society Of New South Wales <case> [Section 63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s63.html) provides: Final determination 
The Court shall grant, either absolutely or on terms, all such remedies as any party may appear to be entitled to in respect of any legal or equitable claim brought forward in the proceedings so that, as far as possible, all matters in controversy between the parties may be completely and finally determined, and all multiplicity of legal proceedings concerning any of those matters avoided.
Glenorcy concerned an appeal under <case> of the 1987 Act from a disallowance of claims made by the Fidelity Fund. At issue was the nature of the appeal under <case> - see at [28] and [31]. One part of that dispute concerned whether, if error was demonstrated, the matter should be remitted to the Law Society or whether the Court could make a decision on the material before it.
Greg James J said at [32]: [32] Section 90(4) (scil, <case>) confers full power on the court, just as is conferred elsewhere in the Act where similar words are used and is conferred under other Acts, again where similar words are used. I do not see that there is any reason, having regard to my view of the proper construction of s.80(4) and my view that the concept of insufficiency to which it refers involves a matter of fact rather than a matter of subjective opinion why I should not decide the question. All the necessary materials are before me. For the court to determine the matter accords with the principles in House , accords with the general law relating to review of an administrative decision and accords with [s.63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s63.html) of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) which provides:-:- 
The court shall grant, either absolutely or on terms, all such remedies as any party may appear to be entitled to in respect of any legal or equitable claim brought forward in the proceedings so that, as far as possible, all matters in controversy between the parties may be completely and finally determined, and all multiplicity of legal proceedings concerning any of those matters avoided.
The Plaintiff in the present case sought to rely on that passage to argue that [s 63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s63.html) empowered the Court in the present case to consider the merits of the claim by construing <case> as permitting a challenge to what was said to be the disallowance by the Fidelity Fund of the Plaintiff's claim.
In my opinion, what is said in Glenorcy is of no assistance to the Plaintiff in the present case. There was a properly brought appeal under <case> in that case. [Section 63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s63.html) is a facilitative provision to prevent formalities and failures to adhere strictly to procedures from inhibiting the final determination of claims so that all necessary orders can be made. So, for example, the section would allow in Family Provision proceedings orders and declarations about the proper construction of a will: Langley versus Langley <case>.
[Section 63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s63.html) cannot be construed as overriding or removing limitations in other specific provisions providing an appeal to this Court.
The Defendant submitted that it would be inappropriate, in any event, for the Court to exercise any jurisdiction in respect of the claim other than an extension of time, having regard to the definition of "failure to account" in <case>(b). The starting point for this is <case> which provides that the Fidelity Fund is to be held and applied by the Law Society for the purpose of compensating persons who suffer pecuniary loss because of a "failure to account" or a "dishonest default". The definition of "failure to account" is contained in <case>. The only failure to account that is compensable is one that arises from an act or omission of the solicitor for which the solicitor has been convicted of a crime or an offence involving dishonesty (not the position in the present case) or which the Law Society Council has found to be dishonest. Sub-section (3) then goes on to provide that a finding by the Law Society Council that an act or omission is, or is not, dishonest is final and conclusive.
The other way a person can be compensated is if there is a dishonest default but that requires, as <case> makes clear, a final judgment against the solicitor as a result of the dishonest act or omission, and the judgment debt is not fully satisfied. That is not the position in the present case.
In Vassiliadis versus Law Society of NSW [(1997) 41 NSWLR 383] the alleged failure by the solicitor was not one that fell within the definition in <case> nor the definition in <case>. That is, the solicitor had not been convicted of an offence involving dishonesty and the Law Society had not found the act to be dishonest. In that case the Law Society informed the claimant that it had disallowed the claims on the ground that there was insufficient evidence and documentation produced to establish entrustment of the monies, that the solicitor failed to account and that the solicitor was dishonest. An appeal was brought under <case> of the Act.
Sheller JA (with whom Dunford and Sperling AJJA agreed) said (at 387): 
However, whatever may be the ambit of the appeal, the ultimate question remains the same, namely whether the claimant is entitled to compensation from the Fund having suffered "pecuniary loss because of a failure to account". The
Act stated clearly what was meant by failure to account. Relevantly, it could only be a failure arising from an act or omission of the solicitor or associate which the Law Society Council had found to be dishonest. A challenge on appeal to such a finding would have led nowhere. If the Council had not found the act or omission to be dishonest, the fact that the Court did so find would not bring the failure within the definition of failure to account.
Equally, if the Council had found that the act or omission was dishonest, the fact that the Court found otherwise would not take it outside the definition.
In short, the Fidelity Fund could only be applied for the purpose of compensating persons who suffered pecuniary loss "because of a failure to account". Unless that definition was satisfied there was no basis upon which the Court could intervene to uphold a claim.
In the present case there has been no finding by the Law Society Council of dishonesty. In those circumstances any appeal under <case> would be doomed to fail: Whitfield versus The Law Society of New South Wales (Unreported - 4 December 1998, Greg James J); Barber versus The Law Society of New South Wales <case> at <case>; Law Society of New South Wales versus Glenorcy Pty Ltd <case>; <case>.
No basis has been pleaded to justify relief under <case> of the Act. Although sub-s (4) appears to permit a claim within three months of the date of publication of the notice referred to, it is not alleged anywhere in the pleading that such a notice has been published In any event, the claim that may be made is one that arises from a failure to account. Reliance on <case> contains the same difficulties as has just been discussed in relation to <case> because of the requirement by the Law Society Council to make a finding of dishonesty.
The relief sought under <case>(b) is similarly misconceived because there has been no dishonest default within the definition of that term in <case> and no pleading of any factual matters concerning Mr Damanios as are contained in <case>.
The result is that the only relief which may be sought by the Plaintiff in the present circumstances is relief by way of an extension of time under <case>(d) of the Act.
The existing Statement of Claim should be struck out. Leave should be refused to the Plaintiff to file the proposed Amended Statement of Claim. However, the Notice of Motion should be adjourned to permit the Plaintiff, if he so desires, to amend that Motion to file an Amended Statement of Claim in accordance with these reasons.
