JUDGMENT:  - 4 - 
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION  
WARD J  
FRIDAY 5 FEBRUARY 2010  /281250 EXPRESS BUSINESS FINANCE PTY LTD versus PAMELA BARCELON AND DOMINIC FRANK MONACO HER HONOUR: In these proceedings the plaintiff has commenced, by way of statement of claim, proceedings against two defendants, Mr Dominic Monaco and Ms Pamela Barcelon. The plaintiff is a financier. The plaintiff lent moneys to Mr Monaco secured by an unregistered mortgage over certain property. That property was owned by Mr Monaco and Ms Barcelon as joint tenants.  There has been no appearance before me on this application by Mr Monaco. Ms
Barcelon is represented by Counsel. She does not object to relief being granted of the kind which is now sought by the plaintiff, namely an order pursuant to [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) for the appointment of trustees for the sale of land (following on from the declaration sought that the plaintiff is a co-owner of the land within the meaning of [s
F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66f.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/)) and an order vesting the land in the trustees for sale.
 The plaintiff has relied upon the principal affidavit of a director of the plaintiff, Mr Anthony DuVernet, sworn 22 October 2008, dealing with the circumstances in which the loan was granted, together with affidavits of Ms
Susan Sydes, a legal secretary, and Mr Paul Dillon, the solicitor with conduct of this matter on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has also tendered an affidavit verifying the consent of the proposed trustees (sworn by Mr John
Biddle), and affidavits of fitness as to the proposed trustees sworn by Mr
Timothy Castle and Mr Peter Harkin, respectively.
 A notice to admit facts was served by the plaintiff on Ms Barcelon (Exhibit
D) and Ms Barcelon responded thereto making admissions as to a large number of factual matters (that response being admitted as part of Exhibit D).
 No evidence has been filed on behalf of Ms Barcelon. The only issue as between the plaintiff and Ms Barcelon has been as to the costs order which should be made in relation to the proceedings. In that regard, Counsel for Ms
Barcelon (Mr Rollinson) has submitted that, rather than an order that the costs be paid out of the proceeds of sale without more, there should in addition to such an order be a direction that in the first instance the costs of the plaintiff and of Ms Barcelon be paid out of the share of the proceeds of sale attributable to the share of Mr Monaco in the land, on the basis that these proceedings were generated by the actions of Mr Monaco in purporting to mortgage the whole of the land to the plaintiff, whereas in reality all Mr
Monaco was in a position to do was to mortgage his half share of the land to the plaintiff.
 The plaintiff resists such a direction and says that it would have been necessary in any event (without the consent of Mr Monaco which it does not have), for the plaintiff to commence these proceedings in order to seek an order of the kind presently sought and that until recently there was no indication by Ms Barcelon that she would consent to the appointment of trustees for the sale of the land.
 Mr Rollinson submits that Ms Barcelon was justified in defending the proceedings in the first instance because the relief then claimed against her under the original Statement of Claim was for possession of the land and because, on the facts as now conceded by the plaintiff, Mr Monaco was the sole author of the litigation which would have been necessary in any event.
 I have had the benefit of the Statement of Facts and Contentions submitted in advance by the plaintiffs. Reliance is placed on the principle stated in
Fisher & Lightwood, Law of Mortgages (9th edition) at p 244 that, in the situation where there is a mortgage purportedly signed by husband and wife but with the wife's signature forged by the husband, the mortgagee nevertheless obtains an equitable mortgage of the husband's aliquot share (accepted in
National Commercial Banking Corporation of Australia Limited versus Hedley (1984) BPR 9477, per Hodgson J; Katsaitas versus Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1987) BPR 12,049, per Young J, as his Honour then was; and Westpac Banking
Corporation versus Sansom (1994) 6 BPR 13,790).
 An equitable mortgage may be created by an agreement in which there is shown to be an intention to create a security and where valuable consideration is given, provided the agreement is specifically enforceable (Westfield Holdings v Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd [(1992) 32 NSWLR 194], at 200 per Young J).  Here, Ms Barcelon asserts that her signature was forged on the relevant loan and security documents. Mr Monaco admitted that in his record of interview with the police on 10 December 2008 (a transcript of which was in evidence before me) and the plaintiff does not dispute this.
 I am satisfied on the evidence before me that the plaintiff holds an equitable mortgage over Mr Monaco's share of the land (National Commercial
Banking Corporation; Katsaitas) and that I should grant the relief sought by the plaintiff, namely a declaration that, by the loan agreement the mortgage and annexure A to the mortgage, Mr Monaco granted an equitable mortgage to the plaintiff over the land; a declaration that the plaintiff is a "co-owner" of the land within the meaning of [s
F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66f.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) (New
South Wales); an order that Mr Barry Taylor and Mr Andrew Fletcher Needham of
HLB Mann Judd, Level 19, 207 Kent Street, Sydney, be appointed trustees of the land pursuant to [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/); and an order that the land be vested in such trustees subject to any encumbrances affecting the entirety of the land but free from any encumbrances affecting any undivided share or shares of the land to be held by the trustees upon a statutory trust under Division 6D of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/index.html#p4) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/).
 In relation to costs, I order that the costs and expenses of the sale of the land be met out of the proceeds of sale of the land. I order that the costs of the plaintiff of the proceedings be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the land with a direction that in the first instance the plaintiff's costs are paid out of the share of Mr Monaco and I order that the second defendant's costs of the proceedings also be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the land but without directing out of what portion of the proceeds of the land those costs should be borne.
 I further make an order for costs against the first defendant of the proceedings brought by the plaintiff.
