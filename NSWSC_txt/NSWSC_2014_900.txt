JUDGMENT
By summons filed 7 December 2013 the Commissioner of the AFP sought a restraining order and ultimately forfeiture of moneys in two Citigroup accounts. On 17 December restraining orders in respect of the money were made.
The Commissioner now applies under [s 49](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s49.html) of the [Proceeds of Crime Act 2002](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/) (Cth) for forfeiture of the money. [Section 49](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s49.html) provides that the court must make an order that the property is forfeited to the Commonwealth if certain conditions set out in this section are met. Relevantly, those conditions are: that it is a responsible authority applying, and I find that that is so. 
Secondly, the restraining order must have been in force for at least six months. I have already referred to the fact that the restraining order was made on 17 December 2013. 
The requirement that the court be satisfied that the property - to use a general term - derives from indictable offences or is associated with them, as [s 49(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s49.html) requires, does not need to be satisfied if no application has been made under Div 3 of [Pt 2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/index.html#p2)-[1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/index.html#p1) for the property to be excluded - subs (3). I am satisfied on the evidence that, although it was indicated at an earlier time that such an application would be made by Knightsbridge North Lawyers, no such application has in fact been made by them. They have not appeared this morning when called. 
Finally, the court must be satisfied that the authority has taken reasonable steps to identify and notify persons with an interest in the property. I am satisfied from the affidavit of Trenton Andrew Schmidt sworn 29 January 2014 that all reasonable steps have been taken to identify and notify any person who has or might have an interest in the property.
In those circumstances, I make orders 1 to 4 contained in the Short Minutes of Order. I note that there is no order as to costs. I grant liberty to apply. * * *
