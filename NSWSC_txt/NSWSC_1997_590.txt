Last Updated: 4 March 1998 
Lawcover Pty Limited versus The Commissioner of Police for New South Wales /97 November 1997 
Hodgson CJ in Equity 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division 
NO 1447 OF 1997 LAWCOVER PTY LIMITED V THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE FOR NEW
SOUTH WALES 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: On or about 17th January 1997, pursuant to a search warrant issued on the same day, the defendant, The Commissioner of Police for New South Wales, seized certain documents from the plaintiff, Lawcover Pty. Limited. In these proceedings, brought by Lawcover against The Commissioner of Police and commenced on 20th February 1997, the plaintiff seeks declarations that some of the documents are the subject of legal professional privilege, and that some of them do not fall within the terms of the search warrant; and also seeks consequential orders. 
OUTLINE OF FACTS 
The circumstances giving rise to the search warrant arise from attempts to settle certain proceedings in this Court.

The first such proceedings were commenced in 1980 by Tectran Corporation Pty.
Limited ("Tectran") and an associated company against Raybos Australia Pty.
Limited ("Raybos") and Dr. L.J. Rajski alleging breaches of contract.
Initially, Allen Allen & Hemsley ("AAH") were the solicitors acting for the Tectran interests. Further proceedings were commenced in 1985 by Raybos and Dr. Rajski against the Tectran interests and AAH, for alleged conspiracy and abuse of process. AAH ceased to act for the Tectran interests, and Blake
Dawson Waldron ("BDW") commenced to act for them. AAH were represented by
Minter Ellison, Solicitors. In 1986, proceedings were commenced by Raybos and
Dr. Rajski against BDW.

Apart from those proceedings, there were various other related civil proceedings commenced during 1985 to 1988, and also various contempt proceedings brought in the Court of Appeal between 1985 and 1987 by Raybos and
Dr. Rajski.

In 1988, the Director of Public Prosecutions commenced criminal proceedings against two officers or employees of Tectran for alleged perjury in evidence given by them in an interlocutory hearing of one of these proceedings.

In 1993, settlement negotiations commenced between the parties to the civil proceedings. It seems that such negotiations had come to an end without any concluded agreement being reached, at least by the end of 1996.

It appears that by April 1996, Dr. Rajski had made complaints to the Police that certain conduct of AAH and/or BDW relating to the settlement negotiations involved criminal offences; and these complaints gave rise to an investigation headed by Detective Inspector Grimmond.

Detective Inspector Grimmond obtained the search warrant in question on the basis that it had been alleged that certain conduct of AAH amounted to fraudulent misappropriation, and that certain conduct of AAH and BDW amounted to an attempt to pervert the course of justice.

ISSUES 
Lawcover initially claimed (on behalf of itself, underwriters, and AAH) legal professional privilege and/or common interest privilege in relation to most of the documents seized.

It took the same objection, and also an objection based on s.131 of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ea80/), to certain documents tendered in the case before me. The claims of legal professional privilege, common interest privilege and s.131 privilege were opposed by the defendant inter alia by an allegation of improper purpose. I indicated that I would rule on the admissibility of these documents, so far as it was necessary to do so, in my judgment in the proceedings.

However, during the hearing, Mr. Jacobson QC for Lawcover indicated to me that the declarations and orders were no longer sought in relation to certain of the subject documents, namely those numbered 1-73 inclusive in the plaintiff's amended list of documents; and those have been inspected on behalf of the defendant. In the result, the case has been contested only in relation to documents 74-238 in the plaintiff's amended list. Having looked at those documents for the purpose of determining admissibility of evidence before me, and also for the purpose of coming to a decision of the case, it does seem clear that the vast majority of them could not possibly be considered as being in furtherance of any improper purpose. However, there are four documents that could conceivably relate to alleged improper purpose, and I do in any event have to come to a view as to the applicability of legal professional privilege and common interest privilege. Accordingly, it is necessary for me to consider the admissibility of the documents whose admissibility was in contest, although in the result I do not find it necessary to come to a final conclusion concerning most of them.

In considering the admissibility of evidence in proceedings before me, it is necessary for me to have regard to [ss.118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s118.html), [119](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s119.html), [125](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s125.html), [126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126.html) and [131](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), which are in the following terms: . Evidence is not to be adduced if, on objection by a client, the court finds that adducing the evidence would result in disclosure of: a confidential communication made between the client and a lawyer, or a confidential communication made between 2 or more lawyers acting for the client; or the contents of a confidential document (whether delivered or not) prepared by the client or a lawyer, for the dominant purpose of the lawyer, or one or more of the lawyers, providing legal advice to the client.
 . Evidence is not to be adduced if, on objection by a client, the court finds that adducing the evidence would result in disclosure of: a confidential communication between the client and another person, or between a lawyer acting for the client and another person, that was made, or the contents of a confidential document (whether delivered or not) that was prepared, for the dominant purpose of the client being provided with professional legal services relating to an Australian or overseas proceeding (including the proceeding before the court), or an anticipated or pending Australian or overseas proceeding, in which the client is or may be, or was or might have been, a party.
 (1) This Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence of: a communication made or the contents of a document prepared by a client or lawyer (or both), or a party who is not represented in the proceeding by a lawyer, in furtherance of the commission of a fraud or an offence or the commission of an act that renders a person liable to a civil penalty, or a communication or the contents of a document that the client or lawyer (or both), or the party, knew or ought reasonably to have known was made or prepared in furtherance of a deliberate abuse of a power.

For the purposes of this section, if the commission of the fraud, offence or act, or the abuse of power, is a fact in issue and there are reasonable grounds for finding that: the fraud, offence or act, or the abuse of power, was committed, and a communication was made or documents prepared in furtherance of the commission of the fraud, offence or act or the abuse of power, the court may find that the communication was so made or the document so prepared.

In this section: "power" means a power conferred by or under an Australian law.
 If, because of the application of [section 121](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s121.html), [122](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s122.html), [123](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s123.html), [124](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s124.html) or [125](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s125.html), this Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence of a communication or the contents of a document, those sections do not prevent the adducing of evidence of another communication or document if it is reasonably necessary to enable a proper understanding of the communication or document.
 (1) Evidence is not to be adduced of: a communication that is made between persons in dispute, or between one or more persons in dispute and a third party, in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of the dispute, or a document (whether delivered or not) that has been prepared in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of a dispute.

Subsection (1) does not apply if: the persons in dispute consent to the evidence being adduced in the proceeding concerned or, if any of those persons has tendered the communication or document in evidence in another Australian or overseas proceeding, all the other persons so consent, or the substance of the evidence has been disclosed with the express or implied consent of all the persons in dispute, or the substance of the evidence has been partly disclosed with the express or implied consent of the persons in dispute, and full disclosure of the evidence is reasonably necessary to enable a proper understanding of the other evidence that has already been adduced, or the communication or document included a statement to the effect that it was not to be treated as confidential, or the evidence tends to contradict or to qualify evidence that has already been admitted about the course of an attempt to settle the dispute, or the proceeding in which it is sought to adduce the evidence is a proceeding to enforce an agreement between the persons in dispute to settle the dispute, or a proceeding in which the making of such an agreement is in issue, or evidence that has been adduced in the proceeding, or an inference from evidence that has been adduced in the proceeding, is likely to mislead the court unless evidence of the communication or document is adduced to contradict or to qualify that evidence, or the communication or document is relevant to determining liability for costs, or making the communication, or preparing the document, affects a right of a person, or the communication was made, or the document was prepared, in furtherance of the commission of a fraud or an offence or the commission of an act that renders a person liable to a civil penalty, or one of the persons in dispute, or an employee or agent of such a person, knew or ought reasonably to have known that the communication was made, or the document was prepared, in furtherance of a deliberate abuse of a power.

For the purposes of subsection (2)(j), if commission of the fraud, offence or act is a fact in issue and there are reasonable grounds for finding that: the fraud, offence or act was committed, and a communication was made or document prepared in furtherance of the commission of the fraud, offence or act, the court may find that the communication was so made or the document so prepared.

For the purposes of subsection (2)(k), if: the abuse of power is a fact in issue, and there are reasonable grounds for finding that a communication was made or document prepared in furtherance of the abuse of power, the court may find that the communication was so made or the document was so prepared.

In this section: a reference to a dispute is a reference to a dispute of a kind in respect of which relief may be given in an Australian or overseas proceeding, and a reference to an attempt to negotiate the settlement of a dispute does not include a reference to an attempt to negotiate the settlement of a criminal proceeding or an anticipated criminal proceeding, and a reference to a communication made by a person in dispute includes a reference to a communication made by an employee or agent of such a person, and a reference to the consent of a person in dispute includes a reference to the consent of an employee or agent of such a person, being an employee or agent who is authorised so to consent, and a reference to commission of an action includes a reference to a failure to act.
 in this section: "power" means a power conferred by or under an Australian law.

In considering the ultimate issue in the case, concerning the application of legal professional privilege to documents seized under a warrant, there is a question whether the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) is applicable at all. The Act is expressed as applying to evidence sought to be adduced in legal proceedings. It seems clear that it applies in processes ancillary to Court proceedings, such as questions of inspection of documents produced in answer to a subpoena or Notice to Produce: see Telstra
Corporation v. Australis Media Holdings [(1997) 41 NSWLR 227.] In that case, McLelland, C.J. in Eq. suggested that it would be anomalous and confusing if different principles applied to processes ancillary to Court proceedings from those applicable to the adducing of evidence in Court. In
DPP v. Kane, 10th September 1997, unreported, Hunt, C.J. at C.L. suggested (pp.17-18) that similar considerations applied to any privilege claimed to arise in circumstances independent of judicial proceedings.

Whether or not this is so may depend on the circumstances in which the question arises. As regards cases such as the present, search warrants have the purpose not only of obtaining evidence for use in Court proceedings, but also of enabling the Police to pursue their investigations of offences. It may accordingly be appropriate that claims of legal professional privilege in relation to warrants should have to satisfy the common law "sole purpose" test rather than the statutory "dominant purpose" test, in order to prevent police having access to documents for the purpose of investigation. For reasons which will appear, it is not necessary for me to decide that matter in this case.

ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE 
I have reserved for consideration in my judgment in the case the question of admissibility of three documents or classes of documents which were tendered before me.

First, there is a statement made by Dr. Rajski and documents associated with it. Dr. Rajski's statement was initially objected to on the ground that it was hearsay; but Dr. Rajski was available for cross-examination, and Mr. Jacobson did not suggest he would be prejudiced if Dr. Rajski's statement was put on affidavit and Dr. Rajski made available for cross-examination. In the event,
Mr. Jacobson did not require that such an affidavit be prepared, and did not press the hearsay objection. The statement and associated documents were also objected to on the ground that they related to communications and documents made in connection with without prejudice negotiations to settle legal proceedings. This gave rise to questions under [s.131](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), which I will deal with shortly.

The next matter objected to was an annexure to Detective Inspector Grimmond's affidavit which comprised the grounds on which the warrant had been applied for and issued. This was objected to on the basis that any probative material in it was hearsay.

Finally, there was the document MFI2, an internal memorandum of AAH concerning terms of settlement said to have been agreed in principle with Dr. Rajski and
Tectran. This was objected to on the ground of legal professional privilege, and also on the basis that it was a document prepared in connection with without prejudice negotiations for settlement, and so was excluded by [s.131](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).

Submissions 
Both sides provided outlines of submissions on the issue of loss of legal professional privilege by reason of what might generally be called improper purpose: these submissions were directed to the ultimate issue before me, but they also have relevance to the question of admissibility of Dr. Rajski's statement and associated documents, and also MFI2.

Briefly, Mr. Johnson SC submitted that communications between a legal adviser and client which facilitate the commission of crime or fraud are not privileged: R. v. Cox & Railton [(1884) 14 QBD 153]; Attorney-
General (NT) v. Kearney [(1985) 185 CLR 500.] At common law, it appeared that what was necessary was to make out a prima facie case:
O'Rourke v. Darbishire [(1920) AC 581]; Baker v. Evans [(1987) 77 ALR 565]; Australian Federal Police v. Propend Finance (1997) 71
ALJR 327. Under the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), [s.125](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s125.html) required the Court to determine whether there were reasonable grounds for finding that the relevant communication was made in furtherance of the fraud or offence. On the question of whether hearsay material could be relied on, the High Court was divided in Propend; Dawson, Toohey, and Kirby JJ. held that hearsay was admissible, while Brennan, C.J. and McHugh, J. and Gaudron,
J. held that it was not; and Gummow, J. did not address the issue.

As regards the improper purpose, Mr. Johnson pointed to s.319 of the Crimes
Act, which makes it an offence to do an act "intending in any way to pervert the course of justice". It was an attempt to pervert the course of justice for a person to pay money to a complainant to induce the complainant to seek to have criminal charges dropped: see R. v. Arley [(1993) 1 WLR 364]; R. v.
Panayiotou [(1973) 1 WLR 1032]; The Queen v. Rogerson <case>; [(1992) 174 CLR 268]; Meissner v. The Queen <case>; [(1995) 184 CLR 132.] The persons negotiating with Dr. Rajski and Raybos offered them inducements to join in approaching the DPP to seek to have perjury charges dropped; and also to withdraw contempt proceedings, which were criminal proceedings: see Raybos Australia v. Jones [(1985) 2 NSWLR ] at ; Witham v. Holloway [(1995) 183 CLR 525.] If
Lawcover was not a party to this illegality, then presumably money was obtained from Lawcover without disclosing the illegal purpose, and that could amount to a fraud on Lawcover: see Jones v. Dumbrell <case>; [(1981) 1 VR 199]; Ray v. Sempers <case>; [(1974) AC .] Mr.
Johnson submitted that an intention to deceive Lawcover might be inferred from the fact that correspondence on behalf of Raybos and Dr. Rajski indicated that the proposal to include a term about having criminal charges dropped was an obstacle to settlement, and this was never passed on to Lawcover.

Mr. Jacobson submitted there was no substance in the assertion that privilege should be displaced because of misconduct; but submitted that, in any event, it was not necessary for the Court to decide this, because the only documents to which this submission could conceivably apply are documents in respect of which legal professional privilege has now been waived. Certainly, he submitted, documents created prior to 16th September 1994, when the in- principle agreement was reached, and documents which related solely to the merits and prospects of the parties in the proceedings between them, could not on any view fall within the alleged improper purpose.

The submissions did not deal with some peculiar problems associated with [s.131](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), which I mention below. This is because the without prejudice objection was only taken towards the end of the hearing, when the hearsay objection to Dr. Rajski's statement had been overcome.

Decision 
In relation to Dr. Rajski's statement and the associated documents, and also
MFI2, it is necessary to consider the effect of [s.131](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).

Before doing so, I note that at general law, the "without prejudice" privilege apparently operated only as between the parties to the negotiations and their agents, only in respect of the particular dispute being negotiated, only in relation to statements relevant to that dispute, and only in relation to statements reasonably incidental to the negotiations to settle: see Barden v.
Barden <case>; [(1921) 21 SR 588];
Field v. Commissioner for Railways for NSW <case>; [(1957) 99 CLR 285.] It had apparently never been claimed in criminal proceedings; see Cross, On Evidence, 3rd. Aust.Ed., 13.73.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) is not so limited. It has specific exceptions, some of which I will mention in a moment; but otherwise, it appears to apply in all proceedings (not just those in respect of which a settlement was being negotiated), whenever communications have been made or documents prepared in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of any legal proceedings. In general terms, waiver of the privilege requires the consent of all parties to the communications.
 [Section (2)(j)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) does provide for an exception in relation to improper purpose. However, this exception only applies to communications made, or documents prepared, "in furtherance of the commission of a fraud or an offence or the commission of an act that renders a person liable to a civil penalty"; and accordingly, does not seem to apply to communications to which any such communications or documents respond, or communications which themselves respond to any such communications or documents. If the other communications tended to contradict or qualify the evidence comprised in the communications or documents affected by the improper purpose, or if the latter communications or documents were likely to mislead the court unless the other communications were admitted, then [s.131(2)(e)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) and (g) would apply to make the other communications admissible; but there is no provision which makes those other communications admissible simply because they are reasonably necessary to enable a proper understanding of the communications or documents affected by the improper purpose. That is, there is not, in association with [s.131](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html), any provision similar to [s.126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/).
 [Section (2)(j)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) is curious also because it makes the documents affected by the improper purpose admissible even if the parties who are entirely innocent of the improper purpose object to the admission of the documents; while making inadmissible the communications or documents emanating from the "innocent" parties, even if the innocent parties consent to their admission, so long as the "guilty" party objects to the admission of such documents.

If that analysis is correct, the result would be that, even if communications made or documents prepared by parties negotiating with Dr. Rajski and Raybos were made or prepared with the appropriate improper purpose, this would only make admissible the particular communications by those other parties and documents prepared by those other parties: communications made and documents prepared by or on behalf of Dr. Rajski or Raybos, in connection with the settlement negotiations, would still have to be excluded if the other parties objected, even though these other parties had made their communications and prepared their documents with an improper purpose. Furthermore, this would mean that the very question of improper purpose would have to be considered without regard to the communications and documents prepared by and on behalf of Dr. Rajski and Raybos. It is apparent that this would be a highly unsatisfactory situation.

For reasons to which I will come, I will not have to finally decide whether this is correct, or attempt to apply this view in this case. However, the question may arise squarely should prosecutions be brought against parties who negotiated with Dr. Rajski and Raybos. Since the views I have expressed seem to be virtually compelled by the wording of [s.131](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html),
I would recommend that immediate consideration be given to amending [s.131](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) to deal with this unsatisfactory situation. It would appear to be a more reasonable approach to limit the exclusion of without prejudice communications to the proceedings which those communications were intended to settle; and/or to make the effect of improper purpose merely to remove the right of the "guilty" party to object to the admission of any of the without prejudice communications from either side. At the very least, there should be a provision equivalent to [s.126](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s126.html) applying to [s.131(2)(j).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) 
As appears from the above, my tentative view is that, even if communications made and documents prepared by AAH and others negotiating with Raybos and Dr.
Rajski had been made and prepared "in furtherance of the commission of a fraud or an offence" within [s.131(2)(j)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html), this would not prevent [s.
s.131](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) from excluding from evidence the communications from or on behalf of Raybos and Dr. Rajski, which were not so made; and those latter communications could not then even be considered in deciding whether those negotiating with Raybos and Dr. Rajski did have an improper purpose. Furthermore, I do not believe I should make a finding of a prima facie case of improper purpose against AAH or others without giving them an opportunity to be heard. As appears from my discussion of the documents now in issue, no more documents would be made available to the defendant even if I were to find improper purpose in those negotiating with Raybos and Dr. Rajski, and even if I were to admit Dr.
Rajski's statement and associated documents, and MFI2. In those circumstances,
I consider it appropriate not to make a ruling on their admissibility.

As regards the remaining piece of evidence, the grounds for the issue of the warrant, one issue to which that evidence could go would be that arising under [s.125(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s125.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), namely whether there were "reasonable grounds" for finding that a communication was made or document prepared in furtherance of the commission of a fraud or offence or an act that renders a person liable to a civil penalty. I do not think that wording authorises the admission of hearsay evidence as being part of the reasonable grounds for making such a finding. In my opinion also, there is a majority of the High Court in Propend against the admission of hearsay evidence. Although Gummow, J. did not expressly deal with that question, his view that the question of improper purpose had to be approached on the basis of the Briginshaw standard of proof carries with it, in my opinion, the view that hearsay evidence would not be admissible.

However, I think the document on the basis of which the warrant was in fact issued should be admitted as part of the history of the case; but I make an order under [s.136](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) so as to prevent statements in that material operating as evidence by way of hearsay pursuant to [s.60](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s60.html) of the Act.

ULTIMATE ISSUE: DEFENDANT'S ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS 74-238 
Category 2 
Category 2 documents in the plaintiff's list of documents, being documents -90, are described as being "correspondence or notes of communications from/to Minter Ellison, to/from Lawcover or Mr. Bowden as solicitor for
Lawcover". Minter Ellison were solicitors for AAH in the proceedings, and in my opinion, it is a fair inference from the material that Mr. Bowden, although employed by Lawcover, was a solicitor acting for Lawcover in connection with
Lawcover's possible liability arising out of the proceedings. Apart from document 74, and documents 78-9 and 81-2, I think all the documents in this category are clearly covered by legal professional privilege, which clearly is not lost by virtue of any improper purpose.

Document 74 is a letter from Minter Ellison to Mr. Bowden giving advice as to the prospects of success in the legal proceedings brought by Dr. Rajski and
Raybos. It was submitted in effect by Mr. Johnson that there was no common interest as between AAH and Lawcover which could have the effect that this letter was the subject of either legal professional privilege or common interest privilege: see Ampolex v. Perpetual Trustee Co. Canberra [(1995) 37
NSWLR 405], Farrow Mortgage Services v. Webb [(1996) 39 NSWLR .](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281996%29%2039%20NSWLR%20601 "View LawCiteRecord" ) The interests of AAH and Lawcover in relation to the proceedings were at least potentially conflicting.

However, Lawcover had acknowledged that it was liable for the costs incurred by AAH in relation to a successful defence of the proceedings (see document 6) and the only question outstanding as between AAH and Lawcover was a question of interpretation of the policy and its application to legal costs previously incurred by AAH. The letter of 21st July 1993 came as a result of a request from Mr. Bowden that AAH ask Minter Ellison to provide this advice to
Lawcover.

In my opinion, the advice was provided for the sole purpose of providing legal services in connection with legal proceedings in which AAH were and Lawcover and the underwriters could be parties. I think the advice was obtained by AAH for itself and Lawcover: I do not think it is necessary to determine whether
Lawcover can be regarded as a client for the purpose of this advice, although
I do think this is a plausible view. It is enough that in relation to the subject matter of the advice, AAH and Lawcover did have a common interest, with no potential for conflict.

Turning to documents 78-9 and 81-2, these relate to messages received by Mr.
Bowden or by his office from Minter Ellison, concerning the settlement negotiations and the money provided by Lawcover in connection with those negotiations.

In my opinion, they are documents prepared in connection with settlement negotiations within [s.131](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) of the Act, and there is no basis on which, in my opinion, their preparation by Mr. Bowden or his office could be considered to have been in furtherance of any improper purpose of Mr. Bowden or his office. This means that they would be excluded from evidence in Court proceedings by [s.131](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html), but that does not necessarily mean they would be excluded from inspection by the Police.

In addition, in my opinion, they were prepared by Mr. Bowden in his office for the sole purpose of providing legal services to Lawcover and the underwriters in connection with the proceedings in question. There is no evidence of improper purpose by Mr. Bowden or Lawcover which could displace the legal professional privilege to which Lawcover and/or the underwriters would be entitled, either under [s.125](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s125.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) or at general law.

Categories 3, 4 and 6 
Category 3 in the plaintiff's list of documents, being documents 91-205, is described as describing "correspondence or notes of communications from/to
Lawcover (or Mr. Bowden as solicitor for Lawcover) to/from underwriters or representatives of underwriters". In my opinion, Mr. Bowden was acting as solicitor for Lawcover and possibly also the underwriters: whether or not he was solicitor for the underwriters, in my opinion legal professional privilege attaches to all these documents, except for documents which do no more than relate to payments of money (not including provision of a sum towards the proposed settlement moneys). Accordingly, the whole of this category is privileged, except for documents 93, 112, 193, 195 and 196.

Category 4 is described as comprising "documents prepared by or on behalf of
Lawcover and Mr. Bowden, as solicitor for Lawcover or (b) underwriters, or (c) representatives of underwriters for the purposes of the Allens/Rajski proceedings or for the purpose of obtaining legal advice and (d) briefs to and advice from Counsel for the underwriters instructed by solicitors retained by
Lawcover". Category 4 includes documents 206-226.

These documents are clearly privileged, except for Counsel's memoranda of fees, documents 212-214.

Category 6, documents 229-238, is described as "correspondence or notes of communications from/to Lawcover to/from Ebsworth & Ebsworth.

Ebsworth & Ebsworth were solicitors for Lawcover and the underwriters, and in my opinion, these documents are clearly privileged.

Category 5 
Category 5, documents 227 and 228, is described as "correspondence from/to
Minter Ellison to/from John Basten QC". There is no legal professional privilege in connection with these documents, but they appear to be documents which would be excluded from evidence before me by [s.131.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html)
However, I do not think [s.131](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) operates to prevent access to the documents by the Commissioner of Police, so
I do not propose to deny access to those documents.

Schedule 3 
Schedule 3 consists of documents 239-244, which are said to be documents not covered by the warrant. Whether or not that is so, in my opinion, documents -242 inclusive are clearly protected by legal professional privilege.

In my opinion, documents 239, 243 and 244 are outside the terms of the warrant.

CONCLUSION 
In the result, I propose to make declarations and if necessary, orders which would have the effect of denying the defendant access to any of the documents in Categories 2, 3,4 and 6, and Schedule 3, apart from documents 93, 112, 193, , 196 and 212-214.

The excluded documents are merely memoranda concerning payments, and I have excluded them because they do not seem to me to have the necessary confidentiality or relationship to legal advice or legal proceedings. However,
I would be prepared to hear further submissions on them.

As regards costs, my tentative view is that each side should bear its own costs.
