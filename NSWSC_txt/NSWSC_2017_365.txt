JUDGMENT
The plaintiff seeks a restraining order under [section 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) pending the making of orders pursuant to [sections 22](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s22.html) and [28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of that Act.
[Section 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) of the Act says that the court must make a restraining order if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects that the person whose interests in the property is sought to be restrained has engaged in serious crime-related activity, stating the ground on which the suspicion referred to therein is based, and the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion.
The application is supported by an affidavit of Katie Elaine Bourne sworn 4 April 2017. Ms Bourne, who is an authorised officer, deposes to a suspicion that the defendant has engaged in serious crime-related activity or activities, being the commission of the offences of cultivating a prohibited drug contrary to [section 23(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s23.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/) and supplying a prohibited drug contrary to [section 25(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of that Act. Those offences fall within the definition of "serious criminal offence" under [section 6(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
Ms Bourne deposes to the fact that her suspicion is held principally by reading the fact sheet prepared by the police after the arrest of the defendant and from an e-mail exchange she had with a police officer as well as a search of the record of the COPS data base in relation to the defendant showing that he was charged with the offences specified in the fact sheet.
Ms Bourne sought confirmation from the officer whom she believed prepared the fact sheet that the officer had done so, that the fact sheet was true to the best of the officer's knowledge and belief and was prepared on information obtained by police as a result of the investigation. The officer replied in the affirmative to those questions.
I have read the fact sheet and I am satisfied that Ms Bourne has inspected the records of the Commission and has ascertained that property believed to be owned by the defendant is in fact owned by him, notwithstanding that the name of the registered proprietor is a name similar to, but not identical with the defendant. I am satisfied that Ms Bourne's belief in that regard is reasonably held by reason of what appears in the e-mail from the police officer and a further e-mail that came from that officer concerning the circumstances of the purchase of that land.
The plaintiff seeks that the order be made without prior notice to the defendant. It does so based on what Ms Bourne says in paragraph 8 of her affidavit that she is aware that in the absence of a restraining order it is possible for people to attempt to enter into unregistered mortgages of real estate very quickly thereby attempting to defeat the operation of the Act.
I am satisfied that the orders should be made without prior notice to the defendant. The defendant has rights under [section 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10c.html) of the Act to seek a review of these orders.
