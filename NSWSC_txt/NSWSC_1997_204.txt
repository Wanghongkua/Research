Amp Workers' Compensation Ltd versus D E Lam Trading Pty Ltd Matter No /97 [1997] NSWSC 204 (20 May 1997) ` 
AMP Workers' Compensation Ltd versus D E Lam Trading Pty Ltd` ` 1583/97` `20 May 1997` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` /97 - AMP WORKERS' COMPENSATION LTD versus D E LAM TRADING PTY LTD 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an application to set aside a winding up under Part 40 Rule 9 of the Supreme Court Rules. Santow J declined to do that on 2 May because he wanted some evidence as to the company's solvency. The evidence that the court now has is equivocal: the company may be solvent; it may not be. 
However, it seems to me that as everybody consents, there is no real sense in going into that borderline question and, in the circumstances of this case, I should merely make the order as asked.

So, I set aside the order made by the Registrar on 24 April 1997 winding up the company. Order that the defendant company pay the costs of the Liquidator as assessed or agreed.

MATTER STOOD IN LIST.

UPON RESUMPTION.

In lieu of the orders I said earlier, I just make orders in accordance with the short minutes.

Stand over to the Registrar's list on 27 May 1997.
