HUGH STANLEY McKENSEY & 2 ORS versus CHRISTOPHER MICHAEL HEWITT & ANOR 
CA 40845/97 July 1998 
Meagher JA 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Appeal 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: His Honour Mr Justice Einstein heard some litigation in a partnership dispute. The appellants and the respondents were partners of that partnership. The order which his Honour made was that the current appellants, McKensey, Lewis and Hicks pay 70 percent of the current respondents' costs, the current respondents being Messrs Hewitt and Nelson. Messrs McKensey, Lewis and Hicks now seek an order for a stay of that order. 
I decline to grant such stay. The principal reason why I have taken this attitude is that the respondents have made an offer, which is still open to the appellants, that on receipt of the costs they will pay them into a controlled account to await the ultimate decision in the appeal. Further details of the offer will be made available to the Court in a document to be provided by Mr Ashhurst, learned counsel for the respondents. That offer seems to me to be perfectly fair and one which gives to the appellants that to which they are entitled to on the decision.

The order of the Court therefore will be: on the first and second respondents,
Messrs Hewitt and Nelson, by their counsel Mr Ashhurst an undertaking to the
Court to behave in accordance with the letter of offer to which I have referred, this application is dismissed, with costs.
