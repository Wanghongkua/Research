CATCHWORDS: WORKERS' COMPENSATION - Employer liable to pay compensation -Injury deemed to have occurred at the last employment "to the nature of which the injury was due" - Hearing loss - [Workers' Compensation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) [s 17](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html) - No extraterritorial operation - Last employer in NSW liable 
EX TEMPORE/RESERVED: RESERVED 
ALLOWED/DISMISSED: DISMISSED WITH COSTS [Section (1)(c)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html) of the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) provides that for a gradual loss of hearing, or further loss of hearing, compensation is payable by: "the last employer by whom the worker was employed in an employment to the nature of which the injury was due before he or she gave the notice".
 
The respondent worked with the appellant for 12 years from 1976 to 1988, working in a noisy environment. He then moved to the Northern Territory where he worked in another noisy environment in a refrigeration business. On returning to NSW in 1990, the respondent re-commenced working with the appellant, but only for a brief period. He then returned to the Northern
Territory and worked again in the refrigeration business. The trial judge held this was a noisy employment to the nature of which the injury was due. The trial judge held that the appellant was liable to pay compensation to the respondent for his hearing loss as that was the last employment to which [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html) applied.

The appellant submitted that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html) only operated if the last employment to the nature of which the injury was due was in New South Wales. In this case, the last such employment was in the
Northern Territory.

HELD: 
The [Workers Compensation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) does not have extra-territorial operation so as to make the Northern Territory employer liable as the last employer under [s 17](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html)

JUDGMENT 
HANDLEY JA: I agree with Beazley JA.
 
SHELLER JA: I agree with Beazley JA.

BEAZLEY JA: This case raises a simple point, namely, the proper construction of [s 17](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html) of the [Workers Compensation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/).

The facts may be recounted briefly. The respondent commenced employment with the appellant in 1976, initially as a cleaner and later as a welder's assistant, which involved working in a noisy environment. In 1988, he moved to the Northern Territory where he had two different employments including one in his son's refrigeration business, T&G Refrigeration.

The respondent returned to New South Wales and recommenced employment with the appellant on 25 July 1990. However, he resigned on 14 September 1990. During this period he worked in the same noisy conditions as previously but was provided with ear muffs. After leaving the appellant's employment, the respondent returned to the Northern Territory and again worked for some three years in his son's refrigeration business. During the course of that employment, he occasionally went into his son's workshop where a grinder was in use. However, these visits were brief. He also undertook part time work at
Tennant Creek High School, performing what might be described as grounds maintenance work. On occasions, he mowed the school lawns but said the mower was no noisier than a motor vehicle.

The trial judge found that the employment with T&G Refrigeration was an employment to the nature of which the injury was due and that with Tennant
Creek High School was not.

The trial judge held that the appellant was liable to pay compensation to the respondent as, under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html), it was the last employer by whom the respondent was employed in an employment, the nature of which the injury was due. The appellant challenges that determination. There is no issue as to injury.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html) provides: "If an injury is a loss, or further loss, of hearing which is of such a nature as to be caused by a gradual process, the following provisions have effect: for the purposes of this Act, the injury shall be deemed to have happened. . .
 . . .
 where the worker was not so employed at the time when he or she gave notice of the injury - on the last day on which the worker was employed in an employment to the nature of which the injury was due before he or she gave the notice; . .
 compensation is payable by - where the worker was employed by an employer in an employment to the nature of which the injury was due at the time he or she gave notice of the injury - that employer; or where the worker was not so employed - the last employer by whom the worker was employed in an employment to the nature of which the injury was due before he or she gave the notice;" 
Counsel for the appellant submitted that upon its true construction, [s (1)(c)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html) should be read as if there were inserted into its provisions the words which are bolded as follows: "compensation is payable by - . . .the last employer by whom the worker was employed in an employment to the nature of which the injury was due but only if the last such employment was in New South Wales before he or she gave notice." 
Counsel acknowledged that the affect of this construction was that a worker, who had suffered a hearing loss in New South Wales, but whose last noisy employment was with an employer located outside New South Wales could not use the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html) to claim compensation from the New South Wales employer. He submitted that the worker, in that case, would be required to prove, through the combined operation of [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s4.html), [9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s9.html) and [66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html), the extent of the loss caused by the employment in New South Wales and that the employer against whom the claim was made, actually caused the loss for which the claim was made.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html), as the appellant's case recognised, provides an easy path to compensation for a worker suffering from hearing loss of gradual onset. All that is necessary, under the section is for the worker to prove that the last employment (in respect of which that employer is sued) is one to which the nature of the disease is due. It is not necessary to prove that that employment brought about or contributed to the disease: see Smith versus Mann <case>; [(1932) 47 CLR 426] at 440; Russo versus World Services and Constructions Pty Ltd [[1979] 1 NSWLR 330] at 332. As Sheller JA said in Rico Pty Ltd versus Road Traffic
Authority [(1992) 28 NSWLR 679] at -690, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html) proceeds on a series of fictions or assumptions, upon which a worker's entitlement to recover an award under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) is based.

In the present case, the last noisy employment was in the Northern Territory.
However, the Act does not have extra-territorial operation so as to make T & G Refrigeration liable as the last employer under [s :](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html) see Mynott versus Barnard <case>; [(1939) 62 CLR 68.] That being so, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html) operates so as to make the appellant the last employer. In other words, the appellant is the last employer to whom the legislation applies and is thus liable to pay compensation. This construction of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html) is confirmed by this Court's decision in Russo versus World Services and
Constructions Pty Ltd [[1979] 1 NSWLR 330.] In that case, the Commonwealth was the last noisy employer and the respondent the noisy employer before that. It was held that, as the Commonwealth was not bound by the provisions of the New South Wales legislation, the respondent was the last noisy employer for the purposes of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html) and thereby liable to pay compensation.

Given the fictional basis upon which [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s17.html) proceeds, the construction for which the appellant contends involves the implication of language for which there is not only no warrant, but which runs counter to the very purpose of the section. If follows that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.
