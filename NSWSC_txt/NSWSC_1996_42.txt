JUDGE1
HUNT CJ at CL This is a Case stated for the opinion of this Court by Judge
Gallen of the District
Court pursuant to [s 5B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/).
It arises out of an appeal to that Court from the Local Court, brought pursuant to [s 122](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s122.html) of the [Justices Act 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), by the appellant in this Court (Wayne Stephen Roome).
The respondent was convicted in the Local Court on 19 May 1994 on three charges - having a high range prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood, possession of an unlicensed firearm and stealing.
The magistrate imposed sentences of imprisonment of, respectively, six months, six months and three months, the first two to be served concurrently and the third cumulatively. He also ordered, pursuant to [s 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s5.html) of the [Periodic Detention of
Prisoners Act 1981](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/), that those sentences be served by way of periodic detention.
The respondent failed to report for any detention periods as required by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s9.html) of that Act, and as a result the term of his sentence was, by virtue of [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s21.html), extended by the maximum period allowed of two weeks. Application was then made pursuant to [s 25(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s25.html) for the cancellation of the orders that the three sentences be served by way of periodic detention. That application (which was heard in the absence of the appellant) was successful; the magistrate ordered that all the periodic detention orders be cancelled and a warrant was issued, pursuant to [s 26](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s26.html), for the detention of the appellant to serve what [s 26](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s26.html) describes as "the unexpired portion of the sentence to which the order (for periodic detention) applied by way of full-time imprisonment".
The magistrate also ordered that the appellant serve fortytwo weeks by way of full-time imprisonment.
The appellant was subsequently arrested in accordance with the warrant.
His appeal to the District Court followed, and an appeal against the severity of the original sentences was added. The judge held that the magistrate had correctly cancelled the periodic detention order in relation to the cumulative sentence of imprisonment for three months, and he held that he (the judge) had no power pursuant to [s 27(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s27.html) of the [Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/) and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s5.html) of the [Sentencing Act 1989](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/) to set minimum and additional terms.
The first question posed for this Court's determination is whether the judge erred in ruling that the magistrate was correct in cancelling the periodic detention order for the cumulative sentence of imprisonment for three months. The form of the question appears to raise a question of fact as to whether the magistrate was correct in cancelling the order. That is not an issue which can be determined by this Court. In the light of the way in which the matter has been argued, the question would have been better expressed as whether the judge was correct in ruling that the magistrate had power to cancel that particular periodic detention order. That is a question of law which will assist the judge in determining the fate of the appeal to the
District Court. ((1) cf Regina versus Alexander William Madden (CCA, 15 December , unreported) at 5.) That is the question which I propose to answer.
In order to determine that question, it is necessary to refer to some relevant dates. Each of the two concurrent sentences of imprisonment for six months commenced on 27 May 1994, and therefore concluded on 26 November 1994.
The decision by the magistrate to cancel the orders that all three terms of imprisonment be served by way of periodic detention was made on 15 September , or during the currency of the concurrent six months sentences. If only to emphasize the point, that was before the cumulative three months sentence had commenced.
[Section 25(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s25.html) is in the following terms: "25. (1). If an order for periodic detention is in force in respect of a person, the court that made the order may cancel the order.
on application by the person or the Commissioner, or without application, if it appears to the court that there is good reason for doing so." 
That subsection does not make it clear whether the court is permitted to make such an order - whether on application or without application - whenever "it appears to the court that there is good reason for doing so". The manner in which it is set out suggests that the phrase quoted governs the power of the court to cancel the order where no application for such an order has been made, and that it was not intended to be descriptive of the circumstances in which the order may be made once the court comes to consider whether the periodic detention order should be cancelled whether on application or without application. In other words, it suggests that an application by the
Commissioner of Corrective Services cannot be granted simply because "it appears to the court that there is good reason for doing so". Subsection (3), however, provides that: "(3) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the court may, on the application of the Commissioner, cancel the order if the court is satisfied that the person is not serving his or her sentence in accordance with the order." 
That subsection seems to suggest that there is some generality in subs (1), which assumes that the words which I earlier quoted were intended to be descriptive of the circumstances in which the periodic detention order may be cancelled. This point of construction does not need to be resolved in the present case because the application by the Commissioner was expressly made upon the basis of the appellant's failure to report for detention periods as required, and thus that subs (3) was the source of the magistrate's power.
((2) This information comes from documents provided to this Court by consent.
It should have been contained in the Stated Case, as this Court may not (without consent) have regard to matters outside the Stated Case: Thomas versus The
King <case>; [(1937) 59 CLR 279] at 431;
Regina versus Alexander William Madden (at 6).) The attention of the Legislature is drawn to the ambiguity which nevertheless arises in relation to subs (1) and which is of importance to the day-to-day administration of this Act.
There were therefore two basic matters which had to be established before the magistrate could cancel the periodic detention order relating to the cumulative three months sentence pursuant to [s 25:](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s25.html) (1) that the order to be cancelled was "in force" at the time, and (2) that the appellant was not serving his sentence in accordance with that order. If the magistrate was not satisfied as to both those matters he had no power to cancel the order.
It is submitted by the appellant that that order was "in force", notwithstanding that the cumulative three months sentence had not yet commenced, because the order nevertheless had legal effect at the time when the cancellation order was made. Reliance was placed upon the decision of the
Federal Court in Commonwealth versus Crowe, ((3) [(1992) 111 ALR 193] at 202-203) that an agreement entered into pursuant to the terms of the [National Health
Act 1953](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/nha1953147/) may be "in force" even before the date specified as the date of its commencement where it is in existence and even though its central provisions remained executory and conditional in character.
The Crown (represented by counsel instructed by the Commissioner of
Corrective Services) submits that the periodic detention order is "in force" only when the appellant is serving the particular sentence to which the order related. ((4) This submission is, of course, contrary to the stand which the
Commissioner must be assumed to have taken when applying to the magistrate to have this particular periodic detention order cancelled.) It points to the provisions of subs (3) as indicating that the cancellation order can only be cancelled once the appellant has faded to serve his sentence, and that such failure cannot occur until the sentence in question has commenced. The appellant replies that, notwithstanding the provisions of subs (3), the interpretation for which the Crown contends has what is described as the "absurd" and "anomalous" result that, where there are a number of cumulative sentences of periodic detention, only the order relating to the first (or current) sentence can be cancelled but not the subsequent orders not yet in force.
For myself, I see nothing absurd or anomalous in such a result.
Rather, I see an irony in an argument being put on behalf of a prisoner that the
Commissioner can have the order made in his favour - that he may serve his sentence by way of periodic detention - cancelled for his failure to serve that sentence before there has been any such failure, although I hasten to add that I can understand the tactical reasons why such an argument is being put in the present case. The appellant's argument necessarily assumes that, because he failed to report for the first of the sentences, he will probably fail to report when the second of the cumulative sentences commences, thereby warranting what is effectively a conversion of the leniency of a sentence to be served by periodic detention into a greater severity of a full-time custodial sentence. ((5)
Regina versus Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR at 73-74). A conversion in such circumstances could be regarded as being akin to preventive detention.
((6) cf Kable versus DPP [(1995) 36 NSWLR 374] at 377-379, 395, 395-395).
In any event, it is not only the terms of <case> which militate against the interpretation for which the appellant contends. The interpretation for which the Crown now contends is, in my view, inevitably dictated in the light of the consequences of a periodic detention order being cancelled. Section 26, as I have said, permits a warrant to be issued for the detention of the prisoner "to serve the unexpired portion of the sentence to which the order (for periodic detention) applied by way of full-time imprisonment". Section 27 also provides that, where a periodic detention order is cancelled, the "unexpired portion" of the sentence to which the order applied is deemed to be a separate term and, unless minimum and additional terms are set, the whole of that "unexpired portion" must be served by way of full-time imprisonment commencing at the time when the cancellation occurs or (if the periodic detainee is not before the court) when he is apprehended to serve that separate term. Those provisions emphasize, by their references to the "unexpired portion" and by the immediate commencement of the separate term, that the order being cancelled must relate to a sentence which is currently being served.
Together with the other requirement to be satisfied before a periodic detention order may be cancelled (that the periodic detainee was not serving his sentence in accordance with the periodic detention order), those provisions lead me to the opinion that such an order is "in force" only when the sentence to which it relates has commenced.
In my opinion, therefore, the magistrate had no power to cancel the periodic detention order relating to the cumulative three months' sentence which had not then commenced. I propose that the first question be answered "Yes".
The second question posed for this Court's determination is whether the judge erred in ruling that the three months sentence ordered by the magistrate to be served cumulatively could not on an appeal to the District Court be ordered to be served concurrently with the two concurrent six months sentences. The judge held that, because all the periodic detention orders had been correctly cancelled, the three months sentence had to remain a cumulative one. He did not explain why, or why he could not reconsider the whole structure of the sentences on a severity appeal against those sentences.
If the cancellation of the periodic detention order relating to that sentence had validly been made - that is, if the order had been cancelled during the currency of that sentence - <case>(c) provides, as I have said, that the unexpired portion of that sentence is deemed to be a separate term of imprisonment, and it is to commence at the time when the order is cancelled or (if the periodic detainee is not before the court) when he is apprehended to serve that separate term of imprisonment. No question of when the separate term of imprisonment commenced would therefore arise. As in my opinion the magistrate had no power to cancel the periodic detention order relating to that sentence, this second question must be considered upon the basis that that order remains in existence. The judge, of course, did not consider this issue upon that basis, but an answer to this question remains one which will assist the judge in determining the fate of the appeal to the District Court.
Section 444(2) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) permits a sentence to be imposed which commences at the expiration of another sentence being imposed at the same time, but it does not require sentences to be cumulative. There are quite extraordinary problems concerning cumulative sentences arising out of the terms of [s 9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s9.html) of the [Sentencing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/), ((7) See, for example, Regina versus Arnold [(1993) 30 NSWLR 73)] but it is not suggested that that section prevented the judge on a severity appeal to order that the three months sentence be served concurrently with the two concurrent six months' sentences. An appeal to the
District Court pursuant to [s 122](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s122.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) is a hearing de novo, and the judge in the District Court must decide for himself or herself what penalties are to be imposed, not whether those imposed by the magistrate were appropriate. ((8) Budget Nursery Pty Ltd versus FCT [(1989) 42 A Crim R 81] at -87). This was, both in form and in substance, a severity appeal against the original sentence as well as an appeal against the cancellation of the periodic detention order.
There is no longer any express provision in the [Periodic Detention of
Prisoners Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/) which prevents an order being made that a sentence be served by way of periodic detention and to be served concurrently with a sentence to be served by way of full-time custody. [Section 5(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s5.html) had made just such a provision when the legislation was first enacted. It was deleted in 1989 at the same time as [s 5B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s5b.html) was inserted. [Section 5B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s5b.html) permits a sentence ordered to be served by way of periodic detention to be served wholly or partly concurrently with, or cumulatively upon, any other sentence which has also been ordered to be served by way of periodic detention, a provision which is expressed not to affect the operation of <case> of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). That does not deal with the situation where the other sentence is a full-time custodial one. [Section 24(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s24.html) was amended at the same time to provide that, if a prisoner serving a sentence by way of periodic detention is subsequently convicted of an offence and sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding one month, the court must cancel the order for periodic detention unless an order is made that the second sentence also be served by way of periodic detention, and it may do so if the sentence is one month or less. [Section 20](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s20.html) permits the
Commissioner to grant leave of absence to a periodic detainee if he is in custody.
Those provisions suggest that although there is no longer any express prohibition against sentences of both types being served together except where the full-time sentence is of short duration, the Legislature has continued to recognize that it is inappropriate that both types of sentence be served wholly or partly concurrently. As that part of a prison in which the periodic detainees are kept is necessarily separate from those in which the full-time prisoners are kept, a periodic detention order simply could not be complied with by a prisoner serving a full-time sentence. The limitation to a period of one month when both types of sentence can be served concurrently suggests that the Legislature contemplates that a periodic detainee subject to such a short full-time sentence will ordinarily be granted leave of absence for that period. I should add that no assistance as to the intentions of the
Legislature can be gained from the Minister's
Second Reading Speech. ((9)
Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 11 October 1989, pp 10862-10863).
Nevertheless, there is no longer any express provision prohibiting one sentence being served by way of periodic detention and another being served concurrently by way of full-time custody. If the judge intends to make them concurrent, he should, in my opinion, substitute a full time custodial sentence for the periodic detention sentence. ((10) I express no opinion as to whether it would be appropriate in the present case to make the appellant's sentences all concurrent. This Court has no power pursuant to [s 5B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) to determine such a question.) I propose therefore that the second question also be answered "Yes".
In the light of the answers which I have already proposed, the third and fourth questions posed for this Court's determination raise the same issue -whether the judge erred in ruling that minimum and additional terms could not be set.
[Section 27(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s27.html) provides that, where a periodic detention order has been cancelled, the court may direct that the unexpired portion of the sentence to which the order related is to be taken to consist of a minimum term and an additional term in accordance with [Pt 2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/index.html#p2) of the [Sentencing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/). That Act provides, by <case>, that a court may not set such terms where they would together not exceed six months. In the present case, as I have said, the two concurrent six months terms were extended, by operation of [s 21(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s21.html) of the [Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/), by the maximum period allowed of two weeks. It is agreed between the parties that that extension must be regarded as part of the sentence imposed, and not (as the judge thought) as a separate punishment for non-attendance. That agreed approach is, in my opinion, correct. The prohibition imposed by [s 7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s7.html) of the [Sentencing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/) would not, therefore, have applied to the extended concurrent sentences of six months and two weeks.
[Section 27(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s27.html) applies, as I have said, to the unexpired portion of those extended concurrent sentences. [Section 21(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s21.html) also adds one week to the sentence for each week that the periodic detainee fails to report (whether or not leave of absence has been granted), thus reversing the effect of the decision of the High Court in Whan versus McConaghy ((11) <case>; [(1984) 153 CLR 631] at [Section 21](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s21.html) was amended in 1992 as a result of my decision in Regina v
Albert Allan Nolan (17 July 1992 unreported) when, in reliance upon Whan v
McConaghy, I demonstrated the defects in its predecessor and the invalidity of the previous practice of the Department of administratively extending the term of imprisonment when the prisoner failed to attend: Hansard, Legislative
Assembly, 17 November 1992, p 9020.)
The unexpired portion of the extended concurrent sentences would therefore be the six months and two weeks less any period which had in fact been served at the time when the periodic detention order was cancelled. In this case, there was no such period served at that time. The unexpired portion therefore remained one of six months and two weeks. The magistrate's figure of fortytwo weeks was, of course, based upon the fact that he had (wrongly) cancelled the periodic detention for the cumulative sentence as well.
It was therefore open to the judge to set minimum and additional terms in accordance with [s 27(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s27.html) of the [Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/) and [s 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/s5.html) of the [Sentencing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/sa1989121/). Accordingly, I propose that each of the third and fourth questions be answered "Yes".
Finally, I propose that an order be made that the Stated Case be returned to the District Court for the hearing of the appeal to that Court to proceed in accordance with the opinions expressed by this Court. (Submissions were made as to costs.)
The appellant has sought an order for costs against the Crown (which, as
I have said, has been represented by counsel instructed by the Commissioner of
Corrective Services).
That order has been opposed on the basis that, effectively, the respondent has succeeded in its arguments before this Court.
 .
Success has not been absolute, but that does not, in any event, dispose of the application for costs. The Stated Case has been brought to this Court only because the Commissioner of Corrective Services wrongly applied for the cancellation of the three months cumulative sentence in the first place. If the Commissioner had not done so, the magistrate would not have been led into error, nor would the judge on appeal to the District Court. Even if the
Commissioner had not realized his error when before the magistrate, he should have conceded that error when the appeal was taken to the District Court, and when there had been the opportunity to give proper consideration to that issue. He should also have disabused the judge at that stage of his view that it was not open in law to him to set minimum and additional terms (as the
Crown has conceded in this Court). If the Commissioner had done so even then, this Court would not have been called upon to determine these various issues by way of a Stated Case.
In my view, the respondent should pay the appellant's costs.
The orders of the Court are as I have proposed.
ORDERS
The questions posed by the
Stated Case are answered as follows: 
QUESTION 1: Did I err in finding the learned magistrate was correct in cancelling the cumulative term of three months periodic detention when cancelling the six month term of periodic detention pursuant to [s 25(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s25.html) of the [Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 1981](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/) ? 
ANSWER: Yes. 
QUESTION 2: Did I err in finding the sentence of three months could not be served concurrently but must be served cumulatively upon the expiration of the two concurrent six month terms? 
ANSWER: Yes. 
QUESTION 3: Did I err in finding that a minimum term and additional term could not be set pursuant to [s 27(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s27.html) of the Act, notwithstanding the balance of the terms to be served by way of full-time custody amounted to forty-two weeks? 
ANSWER:
Yes. 
QUESTION 4: Did I err in finding that a minimum term and additional term could not be set pursuant to [s 27(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/pdopa1981332/s27.html) of the Act, notwithstanding the two week penalty period which was imposed, additional upon the six month sentences imposed by the magistrate at first instance? 
ANSWER: Yes. 
The Stated Case is to be returned to the District Court for the hearing of the appeal to that Court to proceed in accordance with the opinions expressed by this Court. 
The respondent is to pay the appellant's costs.
