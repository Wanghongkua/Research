The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division /94 - GOVERS V LUFF /97 - GOVERS V LUFF 
ESTATE ROBERT CLARENCE FREESTONE AND THE FAMILY PROVISION ACT 1992 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: I am currently hearing a combined motion in proceedings which have been ordered to be heard together. 
In 4552 of 1994, the plaintiff is Genevieve Marie Govers. Her mother is Marie
Lynn Govers. The plaintiff alleges that the deceased Robert Clarence Freestone was her father. Genevieve Govers was born with Downes Syndrome and is profoundly disabled.

The plaintiffs in the second suit are the aforesaid Marie Lynn Govers and her son Simon Robert Freestone. None of the plaintiffs in either proceedings took any benefit under the deceased's last will.

At the date of his death, the deceased was married to one of the defendants,
Ines Darcy. That marriage produced a child, Jacqueline Lee Freestone. It is convenient to refer to the persons I have just mentioned by their first names.

The deceased left his estate to his widow and to Jacqueline. There appears to be no doubt that Simon was a child of the deceased, and that the deceased's first wife may also be an eligible person. However, the paternity of Genevieve is disputed and especially in view of her health condition, it may very well be that an order for Genevieve would mean that no other applicant would succeed and that the benefit gift to the widow and Jacqueline under the will would be greatly diminished. I am not prejudging the matter; I am merely saying that that is a possibility. Accordingly, the defendants wish to have
DNA or blood testing performed so that they and the court can be as certain as possible as to whether Genevieve is or is not a daughter of the deceased. The evidence is that Genevieve was never part of the deceased's household so that it would not appear that she would be able to qualify under any other head of the definition of "eligible person" if she is not the biological daughter of the deceased.

Scientific evidence filed on the motion suggests that if DNA or blood testing is carried out on Genevieve and her mother, Jacqueline, Simon and Ines, despite the fact that the biological father is dead, the scientist should be able to show, at least, a 95% probability as to paternity.

Ines and Jacqueline consent to the tests being carried out, but Genevieve,
Marie and Simon oppose them. I was told, however, at the hearing, that although the evidence refers to DNA tests, the only tests that are sought to be carried out are blood tests.

I heard the motion on 18 July 1997 and stood the matter over for further submissions. Further submissions were made, but some of these were of little assistance because they referred to the [Status of Children Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/soca1996199/) which has not yet been proclaimed. When that Act is proclaimed, <case> of it will repeal the Children (Equality of Status) Act 1976 and enact provisions dealing with "parentage testing procedures". However, at least for now, I may just put that Act completely to one side.

The first question is whether the court has any power to make an order. Marie,
Genevieve and Simon are each over 18 years of age and so none of them is a child in the sense of being under age. However, the word "child" in <case> of the
Children (Equality of Status) Act 1976 means a person who is in relation to another person as his or her parent no matter what age the first person has attained. That flavour permeates through most of the Act so that an adult person can obtain a declaration of paternity for the purposes of inheriting from his or her deceased father. In <case>, the court is given jurisdiction to order blood tests in any civil proceedings in which paternity of a child falls to be determined. "Child" again in this section seems to me to mean a person of any age whose relationship to another is in question. There is some material in the Act that goes the other way. For instance, subsection (4) makes the court consider the possibility as to whether counsel should be appointed to represent the child. However, that subsection can be read as referring to children of tender years and the presence of the subsection does not act as an indicator that adult children are not intended to be covered.

Section 19 only permits the court to take blood samples from the child, the mother and the person alleged to be the father. It does not authorize the taking of blood from a sibling. In a decision on corresponding legislation in
Queensland, Re Riley [[1996] 1 Qd R 209], 211,
Williams, J held that the Act does not authorize the taking of blood from a sibling without the sibling's consent.

Mr Meek, for Genevieve, submits that <case> only applies where the father of the child is a party to the proceedings. He asks me to compare <case> of the 1996
Act. I must confess that I can find no such limitation in <case> which, as a remedial section, should be liberally construed.

At common law there was no jurisdiction to compel a person of full age and capacity to undergo a blood test against his will: S versus McC [[1972] AC ], 43 and see Re the Marriage of J and P [(1985) 80 FLR 126], 132-3 and
R versus Martin [[1992] 1 NZLR 313], 314, and also Riley's case at p 213.

The cases under the Act suggest that where there is power to make an order for blood tests in order to determine the question before the court, then unless there is something to the contrary, the test should be ordered because the court needs to know the truth. If the court makes an order, then the form of order is as set out in D versus S (1982) 8 Fam LR 571, 575-6. One reason why the court might decide not to make an order is if the distress to the "child" was so great that that distress outweighed the benefits in having the test administered. However, as D versus S itself shows, it is difficult to get within that exception.

In the instant case, an affidavit was tendered by Mr Alexis for Marie after I had reserved judgment to wait for submissions. This showed that there would be some distress caused to the child Genevieve if the testing were permitted. Mr
Meek did not oppose this affidavit being read. However, Mr McGovern for the estate, indicated that I should not read this affidavit because it was tendered too late. It seems to me that in the light of the fact that it has taken three months for submissions to come in, no-one has been prejudiced and
I should read the affidavit. However, it does not appear to me that the material in the affidavit is sufficiently weighty to outweigh the positive value in having the test administered.

Accordingly, I should order blood tests of Genevieve and Marie.

As to Simon, there is no jurisdiction under <case>. However, Mr McGovern says there is power under the Supreme Court Rules to order a medical examination, and this includes the taking of blood tests; see S versus McC at 47, per Lord
MacDermott.

There is no doubt that, apart from the restriction appearing in Rule 8 sub- rule 5, the powers under Part 25 of the Supreme Court Rules may be exercised in proceedings under the Family Provision Act (see Supreme Court Practice,
Note 25.1.1). Rule 5 permits medical examinations, and, in my view, that includes medical examinations in which a blood sample is taken and analysed.

Mr Meek, however, concentrated his submission on Rule 8 dealing with inspection of property. He cited a decision of Bryson, J in Pecar v
National Australia Trustees Ltd 27 November 1996, where His Honour held that tissue removed during an autopsy was to be considered as if it were property under this Rule. That decision is no guidance as to the status as property of blood in a living human being.

Part 25(8)(5) provides that "The Court shall not make an order under this rule unless it is satisfied that sufficient relief is not available under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s169.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/)." [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s169.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) requires that certain evidence is to be obtained in the first instance by request of the opponent and, in the second instance, by order from the court under that section. The scope of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s169.html) is delineated by [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s166.html) It seems to me that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s166.html), and thus [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s169.html), of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) has no application to a blood test.

Thus, [Rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s8.html) can be put to one side and the attention focussed on whether an order for blood test can be made under [Rule .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s5.html) As the only consequence of a person not complying with such an order is that under [Part (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p25) an application under the Act by himself may be stayed, there does not appear to be any downside in making the order. If Simon submits to the order, well and good; if he does not submit to the order, then it may be that it would be appropriate to stay his own application under the Act. On the other hand, it may be not so appropriate. That will have to be determined in due course.

Mr McGovern says that if all else fails, I should cross-vest the powers that the Family Court has under [s
W](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s69w.html) of the [Family Law Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/). I am not too sure what it is I am supposed to be cross-vesting, but it is unnecessary to consider the matter in view of the decision I have reached above. The reason why Mr McGovern seeks to rely on that section is that subsection (3)(c) clearly empowers the taking of blood or even DNA material from other relatives if that is likely to assist the court in determining paternity. I record Mr
Meek's argument that, because of [s
V](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s69v.html) of the [Family Law
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/), it is only when a court has to deal with paternity in a case arising under the [Family Law
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/), that the power in [s
W](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s69w.html) can be exercised. Again, it is unnecessary to deal with this submission.

One other matter was raised, and that is, that the executors are estopped from denying the deceased's paternity of Genevieve because of orders that were made for maintenance in the divorce proceedings between the deceased and Marie. It is put that, because of this estoppel, it is idle to order the blood tests.

Mr Meek supports this submission by reference to Gandy versus Gandy [(1885) Ch D 57] and Vanramer Pty Ltd versus Higgins [(1991) 24 NSWLR ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281991%29%2024%20NSWLR%20661 "View LawCiteRecord" ), 666-7.

It may be that at the trial and if the other evidence is not conclusive, some interesting submissions will be made as to how the deceased's name got on
Genevieve's birth certificate and what happened when the divorce was granted.
It may also be that the trial judge will hold that there is an estoppel when he has all the evidence before him. However, it would not seem to me that, as between the executors and this applicant, there is so clearly an estoppel that it is idle to order blood testing. I say this having read, not only the material, but also what appears in Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley, Res
Judicata 3rd ed (Butterworths, London 1996) para 239 and B versus Attorney
General [[1965] P 278.] The trial judge will also have to consider Mr McGovern's submission that the public interest in this type of case leaves little room for the operation of estoppels inter partes; see Thompson versus Thompson  <case>; [(1990) 99 FLR 375. (See] also Trestain versus Trestain [[1950] P 198], 202; Frost v
Frost [[1968] 1 WLR 1221]; Rowe versus Rowe [[1980] Fam 47and] Re Hill &
Gibbs [(1980) 44 FLR 406).] 
I do not believe that it would make the litigation any quicker or less expensive to determine the estoppel point now rather than at the hearing.
Indeed, I believe the contrary is the case. There may need to be facts brought out to decide the point which can only be done at the final hearing.

Accordingly, I make order 1 in the notice of motion filed on 7 July 1997 in proceedings 4552 of 1994 deleting the word "DNA" and inserting the word "blood". The costs of all parties are to be their costs in the cause.
