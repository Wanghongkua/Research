Wednesday 8 April 2009  /08 RHG Mortgage Securities Pty Limited & Ors versus Elektra
Purchase No. 19 Limited 
JUDGMENT 
The proceedings The proceedings relate to a Subscription Agreement dated 10 January 2008 entered into between, inter alia: i. the four plaintiffs [who for present purposes may be regarded as an affiliated group : namely
RHG Mortgage Securities Pty Ltd; RHG Home Loans Pty Ltd, RHG Treasury Services
Pty Ltd, Receivables Servicing Pty Ltd][for convenience generally referred to as RHG] and ii. Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank AG, Singapore Branch [HVB].
 Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement Notes in the sum of $750,000,000 were issued by the plaintiffs to HVB.
 The defendant Elektra Purchase No. 19 Ltd [Elektra], is the transferee of the interest in all of the Notes held originally by HVB and the assignee of all of HVB's rights in relation to the Subscription Agreement pursuant to two Deeds of Assignment between HVB and Lehman Brothers
International Europe [Lehman Brothers] in the first instance and between
Lehman Brothers and Elektra in the second instance [Deeds of Assignment].
 
The central issues Without being exhaustive the central issues litigated appear to involve: i. Whether under clause 14.30 of the Subscription Agreement the plaintiffs' obligations under that agreement have terminated by reason of
HVB's assignment of the Notes. This involves consideration of: 
Factual issues involving what was assigned and when, and 
Legal issues involving the construction of clause 14.30.
 ii. If the plaintiffs are successful in their argument that clause 14.30 is engaged, whether the Agreement ought to be rectified, including: 
Whether Elektra can claim that an agreement to which it was not a party should be rectified; and 
Whether HVB (a cross-claimant and cross-defendant on this issue) can claim that the Subscription Agreement should be rectified, though it has assigned all of its interests under that agreement; iii. Whether the Indemnity Amounts and Interest Amounts have been calculated "in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner" as required by clause 10.7 of the Subscription Agreement and clause 8.8(e) and (f) of the
Series Supplement, which includes the following issues: 
Whether Elektra has incurred any "currency exchange and basis swap costs associated with the Note Subscriber funding its holding" of the Notes "using financial accommodation raised in Euros" since the Notes were transferred and the Deeds of Assignment were executed, that is, whether
Elektra has incurred any relevant costs; and 
If Elektra has incurred costs, whether those costs have been calculated and claimed in accordance with the agreements; iv. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to restitution of the amounts paid to Elektra or to the controlled moneys account on the basis that the payments were made under a mistake or for a consideration which has totally failed.
 
Flow chart of relevant issues The defendants flowchart of relevant issues provides a convenient vehicle for an understanding of the ordered approach to the issues:  [&lt;img src="/scjudgments/2009nswsc.nsf/files/2009NSWSC258.gif/$file/2009NSWSC258.gif" alt="Diagram showing the defendants flowchart of relevant issues "&gt;] 
The further Deeds of Assignment Part way through the hearing HVB and Elektra executed further Deeds of
Assignment to cope with the plaintiff's contention that such deeds were necessary to assign to the respective assignees, the rights of the assignors to obtain a court order rectifying a Transaction Document to the extent (if at all) that the assignees did not already have those rights.
 By reason of the nature of the issues [and in particular the claim for rectification] the parties descended to an extraordinarily detailed analysis of the many drafts and terms sheets exchanged at a time anterior to the execution of the Subscription Agreement.
 Before setting out the background facts it may be convenient to note some areas of principle.
 
The principles concerning rectification In a recent decision [Masterton Homes Pty Limited versus Palm Assets Pty Limited & Ors <case> the principles which inform the remedy of rectification were examined principally by reference to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Ryledar
Pty Ltd versus Euphoric Pty Ltd [(2007) Aust Contract R 90-254]; <case> The principles examined in Masterton and are presently adopted for the purposes of principled approach to the issues which fall for determination.
 It seems convenient to firstly note the convenient summary of their Honours observations appearing in the headnote: i. The common intention that is required for a grant of rectification is subjective. Proof of the subjective intention of the parties to the contract is fundamental to the grant of rectification. (Campbell JA, Mason P and Tobias
JA agreeing); ii. For rectification to be granted where the parties have purposely and deliberately chosen the words of their contract, there must be clear and convincing proof that the parties held a common intention which is contrary to those words and that those words were chosen by mistake. It is less likely that the parties were mistaken as to the meaning of the words where they are clear and unambiguous, or where they had a common intention which was fundamentally inconsistent with the words they had deliberately employed.
(Tobias JA, Mason P and Campbell JA agreeing); iii. The Court cannot simply ignore the parties' true intention and rely solely upon the relevant common intention being established by correspondence and/or conduct. The whole of the objective and subjective evidence must be considered for the purpose of determining whether the party claiming rectification has established the actual and true common intention of the parties by clear and convincing proof. (Tobias JA, Mason P and Campbell JA agreeing).
 
The type of the intention relevant to rectification In examining the type of intention relevant to rectification, Campbell JA observed as follows: "[267] By contrast, the type of intention that is relevant to rectification of a contract is the subjective intention -- sometimes called the actual intention -- of the parties.
 <case>; [(1982) 149 CLR 337] at 346 Mason J said: 
The implication of a term is to be compared, and at the same time contrasted, with rectification of the contract. In each case the problem is caused by a deficiency in the expression of the consensual agreement. A term which should have been included has been omitted. The difference is that with rectification the term which has been omitted and should have been included was actually agreed upon; with implication the term is one which it is presumed that the parties would have agreed upon had they turned their minds to it -- it is not a term that they have actually agreed upon. Thus, in the case of the implied term the deficiency in the expression of the consensual agreement is caused by the failure of the parties to direct their minds to a particular eventuality and to make explicit provision for it. Rectification ensures that the contract gives effect to the parties' actual intention; the implication of a term is designed to give effect to the parties' presumed intention." (Emphasis added) 
Returning to parole evidence In examining the admissibility of parole evidence Campbell JA further observed: "[269] One way in which it can be seen that it is subjective intention that matters for rectification, concerns the evidence admissible in a rectification suit. Notwithstanding that the contract that it is sought to rectify is in writing, and notwithstanding the common law rule that parol evidence is not admissible to contradict a written agreement, parol evidence is receivable, in an action seeking rectification, to establish what was the intention of each of the parties to the contract: Ball versus Storie <case>; [(1823) 1 Sim & St 210] at 219 ; <case>; [57

 [270] It is also possible to have evidence from the draftsperson of the document stating what his or her instructions were, and that particular words were included in the document by mistake: Mortimore versus Shortall [(1842) Dr & War 363] at 370 per Sir Edward Sugden.
 [271] Lord Hardwicke explained why parol evidence was admissible in this way in Baker versus Paine (1750)1 Ves Sen 456 at 457; <case>; [27
ER 1140] at 1141: 
How can a mistake in an agreement, be proved but by parol evidence? It is not read to contradict the face of the agreement which the court would not allow, but to prove a mistake therein, which cannot otherwise be proved ...
 [272] Not only is parol evidence from the parties admissible to prove their intention, it is of considerable importance. In Fowler versus Fowler <case>; [(1859) 4 De G & J 250] Lord
Chelmsford LC said, at 273 of De G & J, 106-107 of ER: 
Upon the question of rectifying a deed, the denial of one of the parties, that it is contrary to his intention, ought to have considerable weight. Lord
Thurlow, in Irnham versus Child <case>; [(1781) 1
Bro CC 92)] says, "The difficulty of proving that there has been a mistake in a deed is so great, that there is no instance of its prevailing against a party insisting that there was no mistake." And Lord Eldon, in
Marquis of Townshend versus Stangroom <case>; [(1801) 6 Ves Jun 328)], after observing that Lord Thurlow seems to say that the proof must satisfy the Court what was the concurrent intention of all the parties, adds, "And it must never be forgotten to what extent the Defendant, one of the parties, admits or denies the intention." [and see further as to the distinction between the evidence admissible upon construction as opposed to rectification: Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v
State Rail Authority of NSW <case>; [(1982) 149 CLR 337] per Mason J at 352; Toll (FCGT) Pty Ltd versus Alphapharm P/L CLR 165 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ at -179.] 
Outward expression of accord Campbell JA dealt with this matter [at 273] and following. That analysis repays careful reading. Importantly his Honour observed as follows: "[281] In my view, when the fundamental requirement for granting rectification is a continuing common intention of the parties, it is of more assistance to concentrate on what is needed before an intention of the parties to a negotiation counts as a common intention. In my view, when that intention relates to the terms upon which they will contract with each other, it is still necessary for them to know enough of each other's intentions for it to be said that there is a common intention. They might come to know of each other's intentions in this way through those intentions being directly stated, or they might come to know of them through the various other means by which one person's intention can become known to another person. Those means can sometimes involve a process of conscious and deliberate inference. Those means can sometimes involve simply perceiving a gestalt in a series of events. Those means can depend to some extent on the people involved sharing a common understanding of how particular bodies of knowledge or markets or social institutions they are operating in work -- the experienced surgeon, or the experienced chess player, can sometimes see what another surgeon, or chess player, is seeking to do, in a way that an inexperienced person cannot. What matters for present purposes is that for a negotiating party to perform actions or say words from which the other party can gather his or her intention is itself a form of communication. Negotiation of any contract takes place in a context in which various facts are known or assumed by the negotiating parties. Sometimes, for example, if a contract is negotiated in a context where there are well understood business practices and conventions, and nothing is said about those practices and conventions not applying, it can be legitimate to conclude that both parties to the contract intended to act in accordance with those practices and conventions, even if they did not expressly communicate to each other that they intended to act in accordance with those practices and conventions. This view of what is needed before an intention is a common intention, accords, it seems to me, with the Australian case law since Joscelyne.
 [282] Street J, in Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v
Austarama Television Pty Ltd [ [[1972] 2 NSWLR 467](/cgi- bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1972%5d%202%20NSWLR%20467 "View LawCiteRecord" )](http://www.lexisnexis.com/au/legal/search/runRemoteLink.do?service=citation&langcountry=AU&risb=21T3350531945&A=0.421575841302838&linkInfo=AU%23nswlr%23year%251972%25page%25467%25vol%252%25sel2%252%25sel1%251972%25&bct=Aparent) at 473 said: ... the true principle involves finding an identical corresponding contractual intention on each side, manifested by some act or conduct from which one can see that the contractual intention of each party met and satisfied that of the other. On such facts there can be seen to exist objectively a consensual relationship between the parties.
 [283] That passage was adopted by Menzies J in the original jurisdiction of the High Court in Hooker Town Developments Pty Ltd and
Another versus The Director of War Service Homes [(1973) 47 ALJR 320] at 323-4, who added, at 324: 
The consensual relationship there referred to is, I think, the common intention with which the document was executed.
 [284] The passage I have cited from Street J was also applied by
Yeldham J in Bishopsgate Insurance Australia Ltd versus Commonwealth Engineering
Pty Ltd [ [[1981] 1 NSWLR 429](/cgi- bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1981%5d%201%20NSWLR%20429 "View LawCiteRecord" )](http://www.lexisnexis.com/au/legal/search/runRemoteLink.do?service=citation&langcountry=AU&risb=21T3350531945&A=0.8966973054588955&linkInfo=AU%23nswlr%23year%251981%25page%25429%25vol%251%25sel2%251%25sel1%251981%25&bct=Aparent) at 430-431, who added, at 431: 
What many of the cases do make clear, however, is that the firm accord or common intention which must be established as a basis for rectification must be one that has been manifested in the words or conduct of the parties and not merely one which remained undisclosed in the course of the negotiations. But this is a different thing from a requirement that the respective intentions must be communicated ...
 [285] From the distinction that Yeldham J here draws between an intention being "disclosed" and being "communicated", it appears that he is restricting "communicated" to communicated by express statement.
 [286] The passage from Street J was also adopted by Tipping J in
Westland Savings Bank versus Hancock [ [[1987] 2 NZLR 21](/cgi- bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1987%5d%202%20NZLR%2021 "View LawCiteRecord" )](http://www.lexisnexis.com/au/legal/search/runRemoteLink.do?service=citation&langcountry=AU&risb=21T3350531945&A=0.5417767745524072&linkInfo=NZ%23nzlr%23year%251987%25page%2521%25vol%252%25sel2%252%25sel1%251987%25&bct=Aparent) at 30, who regarded it as supporting the conclusion that he drew, that ... while there need be no formal communication of the common intention by each party to the other or outward expression of accord, it must be objectively apparent from the words or actions of each party that each party held and continued to hold an intention on the point in question corresponding with the same intention held by each party." His Honour concluded as follows: "[316] For the reasons I have given, the common intention that is required to grant rectification is subjective. Even though there is a requirement for the intention to be disclosed before it can count as a common intention, that disclosure need not be by words that say in substance "this is my intention". The need for disclosure fills the role of being a limitation on the types of subjective intention that can be enforced through the remedy of rectification, or a limitation on the circumstances in which a subjective intention must exist before it can be enforced through the remedy of rectification. It still remains that proof of the subjective intention of the parties to the contract is fundamental to the grant of rectification.
 Hence the following propositions hold true: i. For a party seeking to obtain a decree of rectification of the
Agreement, it must adduce clear and convincing evidence that proves the document embodying the Agreement does not reflect the parties "common intention": Ryledar Pty Ltd versus Euphoric Pty Ltd [(2007) Aust Contract R -254]; <case> per Tobias JA at [151]; Pukallus versus Cameron <case>; [(1982) 180 CLR 447] at 452, 456; Maralinga Pty Ltd versus Major Enterprises Pty Ltd <case>; [(1973) 128 CLR 336] per Mason
J at 349, 350.
 ii. The requirement of common intention sets a very high standard. The
Court of Appeal in Ryledar Pty Ltd versus Euphoric Pty Ltd [(2007) Aust Contract
R 90-254]; <case> per Tobias JA at [122] recently approved Lord Denning's statement of the law in Frederick E Rose (London) Ltd versus William H Pim Junior & Co Ltd [[1953] QB 450](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1953%5d%202%20QB%20450 "View LawCiteRecord" ) at 461, that: "In order to get rectification it is necessary to show that the parties were in complete agreement on the terms of their contract, but by error wrote them down wrongly...".
 iii. The plaintiff bears the onus of establishing that the true intention of both parties was something other than that recorded in the executed instrument and that the document was executed through some form of mistake: see Ryledar Pty Ltd versus Euphoric Pty Ltd [(2007) Aust Contract R -254]; <case> per Tobias JA at [122]-[130], per Campbell J at [129]; RP Meagher et al,
Meagher, Gummow & Lehane's, Equity: Doctrines & Remedies, 4th Ed
Butterworths LexisNexis [26-010]. Thus Campbell JA stated in Ryledar (at [251]): "It is not sufficient to show that a written instrument does not represent the common intention of the parties -- as well, it must be shown what their common intention was: Slee versus Warke <case>; [(1949) 86 CLR 271] at 281." The second element of what a plaintiff must prove in a rectification suit is that the common intention was not given effect because of some mistake.
 From the extensive case law at least the following parameters of the principles concerning rectification are not in doubt: i. The existence of a concluded antecedent agreement in the term sought to be added or omitted from a contractual document is not necessary in order to found an entitlement to rectification. <case>; [(1949) 86 CLR 271] at 280.3-.7, Maralinga Pty Ltd versus Major Enterprises Pty Ltd <case>; [(1973) 128 CLR 336] at 350.3 (Mason J), Pukallus versus Cameron <case>; [(1982) 180 CLR 447] at 456.5 (Brennan J)] ii. Rectification is available even though the parties are under no misapprehension as to the language of their contractual document but rather their mistake is as to the legal effect of that language. [Commissioner of
Stamp Duties versus Carlenka Pty Ltd [(1995) 41 NSWLR 329]] iii. Evidence can be led as to pre-contractual and post-contractual facts from which inferences may be drawn regarding the intention of the parties and as to the relevant actual intentions of each of the parties [NSW
Medical Defence Union Ltd versus Transport Industries Insurance Co Ltd [(1986) 6
NSWLR 740] at 752C-F].. Stormriders Pty Ltd versus Copperart Pty Ltd  <case> at <case>;
Ryledar Pty Ltd & Anor versus Euphoric Pty Ltd [(2007) Aust Contract Reports -254]; <case> at <case>.
 iv. However, in receiving evidence of post-contractual facts, caution should be exercised in case the evidence does no more than establish a different, subsequently formed intention [NSW Medical Defence Union Ltd v
Transport Industries Insurance Co Ltd [(1986) 6 NSWLR 740] at 752E].
 
Short overview of integers of the critical documents The critical documents are the Subscription Agreement and the Series
Supplement [which Supplement sets out the terms and conditions upon which the notes of the particular series were issued]. Also of relevance is the Trust
Deed of 8 December 2004.
 Clause 3.4 of the Series Supplement makes clear that the Notes will, upon issue, be in the form of registered debt securities, will be constituted under, and the obligations of RHG under the Notes will be constituted by, the
Subscription Agreement, the Trust Deed and the Series Supplement and will be denominated in A$. Clause 3.4 further provides that the entitlement of a holder of a Note (as applicable) is determined by registration as a holder of that Note in the Register of Holders in respect of the Series.
 Clause 8 of the Series Supplement is of general significance dealing with cash flow allocation methodology. Clause 8.8 [generally referred to as "the waterfall"] deals with the distribution of total available income in respect of monthly payments to be made: that is to say on each month there are a series of payments were to be made in a particular order of priority.
 Relevantly at clause 8.8 one finds the following provisions concerning distribution of available income: fifth, pari passu and ratably to the Class A Noteholders, the Class
A Interest Amount for the Payment Period ending on (but excluding) that
Payment Date and any unpaid interest in respect of previous Payment Periods (but excluding any amounts payable under clause 3.13 ("Withholding tax") in respect of the Class A Notes); sixth, to pay pari passu and ratably to the Class B Noteholders, the Class B Interest Amount for the Payment Period ending on (but excluding) that Payment Date and any unpaid interest in respect of previous Payment
Periods (but excluding any amounts payable under clause 3.13 ("Withholding tax") in respect of Class B Notes);...
 eleventh, to pay any other amounts owing not in the nature of principal to the Note Subscriber or the Holders of any Notes, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any amounts payable under clause 10.7 ("Funding costs indemnity") of the Subscription Agreement; [The references to Note Subscriber are ambulatory so that upon an assignment of the Subscription Agreement, Elektra became the note subscriber] The maturity date for the Notes was 2039.
 It is pursuant to the Subscription Agreement that the Note Subscriber agrees to subscribe.
 Some of the terms of the Subscription Agreement relate to the initial subscription and their operation was in effect spent by the time of the assignments in June/July 2008.
 Other terms and conditions of the Subscription Agreement continued on an ongoing basis-for example clause 5.7 dealing with representations and warranties in the following terms: .7 Repetition of representations and warranties 
The representations and warranties made in clause 5.1 ("Representations and warranties by RMS and the Manager") (other than in respect of paragraphs 5.1(g), 5.1(h), and 5.l(u)), clause 52 ("Representations and warranties by the Originator") and clause 5.4 ("Representations and warranties by the Servicer") (other than in respect of paragraphs 5.4(b) and .4(d) will be deemed to be repeated on each Payment Date with reference to the facts and circumstances then subsisting.
 Clause 7 of the Subscription Agreement included a number of what might be called 'boilerplate' type provisions imposing obligations on RHG whilst there would be an amount owing under the notes.
 Hence the effect of the plaintiff's case was that upon an assignment of all of the Notes, it was not only clause 10.7 which no longer operated: the proposition was that in fact all of the future obligations of RHG, the
Manager, the Originator and the Servicer would terminate.

Elektra's position concerning clause 14.30 of the Subscription Agreement Clause 14.30 is in the following terms: "The obligations of RMS, the Manager, the Originator and the Servicer under this agreement terminate on the earlier of: all Secured Money owed under the Notes or to the Note Subscriber being repaid; and the Note Subscriber assigning all of the Notes it holds." Elektra submits that it remains entitled to the indemnity under clause 10.7 in either of two ways: i. The Subscription Agreement should be rectified by deleting clause .30(b).
 ii. Alternatively: "holds" in clause 14.30(b) refers to holding legal title to the Notes (or alternatively at least a beneficial interest in the Notes) and HVB did not hold such an interest, and clause 10.7 should be rectified and/or an estoppel arises with respect to clause 10.7.
 
Rectification of clause 14.30 Very extensive attention was placed by both parties to the relevant content of the materials which passed between the parties and their respective solicitors from the commencement of the drafting of the material terms sheets.
The nine very well stacked volumes of the Court book contained the numerous e-mails passing between in the main, Mr Smith of Mallesons acting for RHG and
Mr Jenkins of Blakes acting for HVB.
 Ultimately the holding is that the parties intended the Subscription
Agreement to operate as if clause 14.30(b) were absent and that the parties' common intention was that if the Note Subscriber for the time being assigned all of its Notes, it could also assign all of its rights under the
Subscription Agreement: this holding being based upon a close analysis of the evidence before the Court as well as the appropriate inferences to be drawn from the whole of the circumstances. In short the necessary clear and convincing evidence of that common intention has been established.
 In giving the reasons for this finding it becomes necessary to slowly travel through a number of documents as well as to deal with the evidence given by the relevant witnesses.
 The exercise which follows includes an examination of: i. The parties' common intention as shown in the term sheet between October 2007 and 30 November 2007.
 ii. The parties' common intention as shown in the draft transaction documents between 17 and 28 December 2007.
 iii. How clause 10.7 ended up in the Subscription Agreement.
 iv. The inherent tension between clauses 12(b) (and other clauses) of the Subscription Agreement on the one hand and clause 14.30(b).
 v. The absence of a rational explanation for a clause 14.30 "carve out" from clause 12(b).
 vi. The evidence of Mr Tyndall about his state of mind.
 vii. The evidence of Mr Goddard about his state of mind.
 The devil lies in the detail and for this reason it becomes necessary to travel through these drafts with care. In the main the defendant's submissions are adopted in terms of this exercise.

The term sheet between 30 October 2007 and 30 November 2007 The search for the ultimate common intention as at 10 January 2008 begins by an analysis of whether there was any and if so what common intention throughout November 2007 that HVB could assign some or all of the Notes with an entitlement to an indemnity with respect to currency exchange costs.
 That there was such a common intention throughout November 2007 is clear from: i. the "final" version of the "Indicative Terms and Conditions" [the "Term Sheet"] enclosed with the engagement letter dated 28 November 2007 and countersigned on 30 November 2007, and ii. the various drafts which preceded it from 30 October 2007, once the currency of the notes had been changed from EUR to AUD.
 From 30 October 2007 until the final version of 28/30 November 2007, each version of the "Indicative Terms and Conditions" contained the following entry or a substantially similar entry with respect to "Transfer": "Notes may be transferred in whole but not in part.
 
The minimum aggregate consideration payable on each transfer of Notes within, to or from Australia must be at least A$500,000 (or its equivalent in another currency) (disregarding amounts lent by the transferor or its associates to the transferee) or the offer or invitation resulting in transfer must not otherwise require disclosure to be made in accordance with [Part
D.2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p6d.2) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) or [Part .9](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p7.9) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/)..." This meant that the Term Sheet contemplated that HVB could transfer some or all of the Notes.
 In each version of the Term Sheet from 30 October 2007, the Notes carried interest. In each such version, that interest included various permutations.
 Each permutation included a Funding Margin described as follows: "The Note Subscriber's net funding cost in AUD basis points of converting month EURIBOR based funding to 1 month BBSW based funding." Hence as the defendant has contended, on the drafting of the Term Sheet throughout the period between 30 October 2007 and 30 November 2007: i. HVB could assign some or all of the Notes with a funding indemnity with respect to currency etc costs, and ii. In the event of such an assignment (including all of the notes), the indemnity would not cease.
 iii. Accepting that the parties contemplated that the Term Sheet would not record the final terms and conditions of their transactions, it documented the parties' intentions as at 30 November 2007.
 iv. The Term Sheet was an enclosure with the engagement letter dated November 2007 and countersigned on 30 November 2007. That letter was signed by Mr Tyndall for HVB and by, among others, Messrs Goddard and Williams for
RAMS companies. Notwithstanding the "indicative" nature of the Term Sheet, the
Term Sheet was included within the definition of "Mandate Documents" with respect to which the parties had various obligations under the engagement letter.
 
The evidence given by Mr Goddard in relation to the Term Sheet Mr Goddard's evidence with respect to the Term Sheet was as follows: i. "[T]he contents of the indicative terms and conditions reflect[ed] as at 30 November 2007 [his] best understanding of the proposed transaction with
HVB" "[a]t a high level ... but there was still much work to be done in preparing the final documents that had to be signed".
 ii. "By the time [he] had signed the letter of engagement of [28]
November 2007 [he] had reviewed at least several drafts of the indicative terms and conditions".
 iii. Mr Goddard was "thoroughly familiar with the contents of the version of the indicative terms and conditions ... that was enclosed with the signed letter of [28] November 2007".
 iv. Mr Goddard was "aware at the time [he] signed the 28 November letter that the indicative terms and conditions included [the] passage about transfer ...".
 v. Mr Goddard thought "[o]bviously if the note was moved there would be a coupon attached to the note, the note was an A$ note so the coupon plus the prescribed margin would be carried over with the note".
 vi. Mr Goddard was aware "that the interest rate which attached to the notes included a funding margin as defined" viz "one month BBSW versus one month [EURIBOR]".
 The finding is that Mr Goddard throughout November 2008 intended that the notes could be assigned in whole or in part with a currency exchange funding indemnity. His evidence that even in October and November 2007 his position was that HVB would not be allowed to assign any entitlement to any indemnity with respect to currency exchange costs is rejected. That evidence is inconsistent with the material referred to above.
 There is no evidence of any document in which Mr Goddard protested about terms of the Term Sheet dealing with assignability and funding margin. His evidence was that from the very start of the transaction he wanted things in writing or by e-mail. Hence the best evidence of his intention is what he agreed to in writing: that is to say the Term Sheet.
 
The evidence of Mr Williams' in relation to the Term Sheet Mr Williams' position with respect to the Term Sheet was as follows: i. He saw several drafts, which he "thoroughly" reviewed.
 ii. He communicated no objections to Mr Goddard about the notes being transferable.
 iii. He understood that the notes would be transferable in whole or in part.
 iv. He understood that with a transfer of notes there would be a transfer of interest entitlement.
 v. He understood that the applicable margin could be one of four types, each of which included a "funding margin" referable to currency etc costs.
 On the other hand he disagreed in cross-examination that he understood that a transfer of notes carried with it a transfer of funding margin entitlement and suggested that he was not "completely focused" on it.
 This evidence contradicts his evidence in iii, iv and versus above. As the defendant has contended it contradicts the clear effect of the "thoroughly" reviewed drafts and final version. Eventually he could not recall what was the "problem" with the funding margin being assignable with the notes.
 Of particular concern in terms of assessing his reliability was the fact that he changed some of his answers across the two days when he was being cross-examined. His evidence given on 16 March [transcript 62 and following] was that as a general proposition, he understood at the time of his e-mail of November 2007 that the notes would be transferable: that is to say that there could be a transfer of some notes or all of the notes. It was quite plain that on his then evidence, his understanding at 30 November 2007 was that the notes were transferable in the sense that the holder could transfer some or all of the notes [see also transcript 63.25] Yet on 17 March he first gave evidence that as at 30 November 2007 his understanding had been that all [as opposed to some] notes must be transferred [transcript 99]. The transcript of the cross examination then includes the following: 
Q. And do you agree that the answer you gave yesterday was correct? 
A. I'm not sure, today and maybe it's having seen the term sheet again maybe that has steered me in a direction.
 
Q. You're saying now you're unsure what you understood by that line? 
A. Perhaps I was unsure as at November 2007.
 
Q. Well you say you're unsure now do you? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. What you thought then? 
A. Yes correct.
 
Q. Can I suggest that your answer yesterday was correct? 
A. I'm not sure today. [transcript 100] Clearly very special care requires to be given to his evidence particularly when suggesting that he had clear recollections of his then states of mind.
The very same problem infects his evidence as to his latest states of mind.
 In short his evidence that at all times he intended that the obligations of the plaintiffs under the Subscription Agreement would cease upon HVB assigning its interest in all of the Notes it held [including any entitlement to indemnity costs under clause 10.7 of the Subscription Agreement] is rejected.
He claimed to have a similar intention even at the time of the terms sheets - yet their terms clearly contradict him.
 He acquiesced in the drafts between 17 and 28 December 2007.
 He was unable to point to any document in which he had communicated to HVB a disagreement with the proposition that the funding margin would be transferable with the notes. He never communicated with anyone at HVB in writing disagreeing with the funding margin being included as part of interest. Nor was he present at any oral communication by Mr Goddard to HVB to the effect that the funding margin should be not be transferable with the notes.
 
Mr Tyndall Mr Tyndall understood that under the Term Sheet, "a transferee of the Notes would be entitled to receive the Funding Margin, because in the term sheet the
Funding Margin formed a part of the interest payable on the Notes and the
Notes were transferable".
 
The following period of time - the drafts between 17 and 28 December 2007 The drafting history of the Subscription Agreement and the Series
Supplement between 17 and 28 December 2007 reflected the parties' intention throughout that period that: i. the Note Subscriber could transfer some or all of its notes, and ii. whether the Note Subscriber transferred only some of the notes or instead all of the notes, the Note Subscriber and the assignee would continue to hold an indemnity with respect to currency etc costs referable to the notes held by each.
 After the engagement letter dated 28 November 2007 [countersigned on 30
November 2007], the first drafts of the transaction documents were emailed by
Mr Smith of Mallesons to, among others, Mr Ng of Blakes, Mr Jenkins of Blakes,
Mr Tyndall and Mr O'Brien of HVB, and copied among others to Messrs Williams and Goddard. As the defendant contended those drafts included the following features: i. The Series Supplement did not deal with any costs referable to currency exchange etc.
 ii. The draft Series Supplement contained a clause 8.8 listing the priority of payments to be made on each Payment Date. Paragraph (h) (which came after other paragraphs dealing with the interest) was as follows: "eighth, to pay any other amounts owing not in the nature of principal to the Note Subscriber" iii. The draft Subscription Agreement contained a clause 9.7 headed "Funding Costs" as follows: "On each Payment Date, the Originator agrees to pay to the Note
Subscriber an amount equal to the cost of converting the BBSW Rate to EURIBOR with reference to the Principal Outstanding of the Notes for the previous
Payment Period." 
The draft Subscription Agreement contained a clause 11 headed "Dealing with interests" as follows: "Neither party may assign or otherwise deal with its rights under this agreement in respect of the Series or allow any interest in them to arise or be varied, in each case, without each other party's consent other than is expressly contemplated by the Transaction Documents in respect of the Series." 
The draft Subscription Agreement contained a clause 13.20 headed "Termination" as follows: "The obligations of RMS, the Manager, the Originator and the Servicer under this agreement terminate on the earlier of: all Secured Money owed under the Notes or to the Note Subscriber being repaid; and the Note Subscriber assigning the Notes." Draft transaction documents then passed between the parties' respective lawyers as follows (in each case to or copied to Messrs Tyndall, Williams and
Goddard): i. 17 December 2007 11.20pm - Blakes to Mallesons.
 ii. 21 December 2007 1.22am - Mallesons to Blakes.
 iii. 24 December 2007 7.18pm - Blakes to Mallesons.
 iv. 28 December 2007 1.21pm - Mallesons to Blakes.
 The drafts which Blakes circulated on 17 December 2007 had the following features: i. Clause 11.7 (previously numbered clause 9.7) of the draft
Subscription Agreement headed "Funding Costs" had the following annotation: "Note: Not agreed. HVB requires these amounts to form part of the interest calculation corresponding to the notes." ii. After the definition of "Interest Rate" in clause 13.2 of the draft Series Supplement, an annotation had been added as follows: "[Note to MSJ: Interest Rate must include the BBSW-EUROBOR funding cost. HVB does not agree to a separate unsecured indemnity without recourse to
Series Assets in the Subscription Agreement]" iii. Clause 3.5 of the draft Series Supplement was now in the following form: (inserted words italicised): "The Notes will, upon issue, be in the form of registered debt securities, will be constituted under, and the obligations of RMS under the
Notes will be constituted by, the Subscription Agreement, the Trust Deed and this deed and will be denominated in A$. The entitlement of a holder of a Note (as applicable) is determined by registration as a holder of that Note in the
Register of Holders in respect to the Series." iv. Clause 13 (previously numbered clause 11) of the draft Subscription
Agreement headed "Dealing with interests" had been amended now to read as follows (omitting marking up): "(a) RMS, the Manager, the Originator and the Servicer may not assign or otherwise deal with its rights under this agreement in respect of the Series or allow any interest in them to arise or be varied, in each case, without the
Note Subscriber's consent other than as expressly contemplated by the
Transaction Documents in respect of Series." 
The Note Subscriber may at any time assign its rights under this agreement and each other Transaction Document and transfer any Note in each case in whole or in part to any person without notice to or the consent of any other party." v. The draft Subscription Agreement contained a new clause 15.23 headed "Rights and obligations to inure": "The rights and obligations of each party hereunder will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party's successors and permitted assigns." vi. Clause 15.30 (previously numbered clause 14.30) of the draft
Subscription Agreement headed "Termination" had been amended now to read as follows (omitting marking up): "The obligations of RMS, the Manager, the Originator and the
Servicer under this agreement terminate on the earlier of: all Secured Money owed under the Notes or to the Note Subscriber being repaid; and the Note Subscriber assigning all of the Notes it holds." In short on Blakes' drafting: i. HVB could assign some or all of the notes.
 ii. The currency etc indemnity was part of interest.
 iii. If HVB assigned all of the notes, the entitlement to that indemnity with the assignment as part of the interest did not terminate.
 The Mallesons drafts of 21 December 2007 in response to the Blakes drafts of 17 December 2007 had the following features: i. The definition of Interest Rate in clause 13.2 of the Series
Supplement had been amended to include as a new paragraph (b): "a percentage notified by the Note Subscriber to the Manager equal to the cost of converting Australian Dollar payments for that Payment Period to Euros, as if the Notes had been issued in Euros." ii. Clause 3.4 of the Series Supplement included the amendment which
Blakes had proffered on 17 December 2007 viz reference to Subscription
Agreement.
 iii. Clauses 12 and 14.30 of the Subscription Agreement included the amendments which Blakes had proffered on 17 December 2007.
 Further the Mallesons drafts were sent after Mr Williams had "carefully" reviewed the Blakes drafts. Mr Williams had understood HVB's position to be that the Interest Rate was to include BBSW/EURIBOR funding cost. The Mallesons drafts were sent after Mr Williams had told Mr Smith which Blakes changes he agreed with and which Blakes changes he disagreed with.
 From 21 December 2007, Mr Williams knew that the Mallesons drafts were in the forms in which they had been despatched. He had this knowledge and understanding: T85.45-87.17.
 From 21 December 2007 Mr Williams: "... understood ... that the effect of the draft Series Supplement and
Subscription Agreement as proffered by Mallesons to Blakes would be that the
Note Subscriber could assign some or all of the notes including a future entitlement to interest including an element referable to currency exchange costs" "[T]he drafts that Mr Smith proffered on 21 December 2007 read with the covering email reflected the instructions that [Mr Williams] had given him in the period between 17 and 21 December 2007." The covering email stated that some changes may not be acceptable to ratings agencies. The covering email stated "[w]e have highlighted below key provisions for discussion...". One was "paragraph (b) of the definition of
Interest Rate (compensation of Euro funding)".
 Hence subject to what was said in the covering email, the position at 21
December 2007 was that there would be an "uncapped" "indemnity" with respect to currency etc. costs as part of the interest rate; some or all of the notes could be transferred; the entitlement to interest including with respect to that indemnity could be transferred with some or all of the notes; this was so even if clause 14.30(b) operated in accordance with its terms.
 As the defendant had contended, on the balance of probabilities it would appear extremely unlikely that Mallesons would have proffered revised drafts in this form if their clients did not intend that there be assignability of the "currency indemnity" in this way.
 
The evidence given by Mr Williams concerning the so-called "problem" which the rating agencies were said to have In his evidence Mr Williams referred to what he described as "a problem" with the ratings agencies Moodys and Standard and Poor, which he variously identified as follows: "The ratings agencies will have an issue with the requirement for hedging.
As we don't know the actual costs of the hedge, we can't include this in the waterfall. It can't be included because it would be for an unknown amount and therefore could not be rated because it could affect the ability of RMS to pay
Noteholders. The raters won't accept this as an option unless it is capped..." Mr Williams' cross-examination included the following: "Q. Going back now to paragraph 14 of your statement was it your understanding throughout the period from 17 December 2007 when Blakes proffered drafts until this response on 21 December 2007 from Mallesons that the issue with the rating agencies was as described in the words you spoke in paragraph 14 of your statement? 
A. I think the issue is perhaps a little bit more specific than just the waterfall, it was - they've got an issue with the cost of the hedge because it's not included in the required payments component of the waterfall.
 ...
 
Q. So when you say that the rating agencies had some issue, as I understand your evidence beyond what you told Mr O'Brien, the required payments, could you explain to his Honour with reference to clause 8.8 if that's appropriate what the issue was? 
A. Yes. From a ratings perspective the rating agencies will want to see that the obligations under any currency exchange is included in the definition of required payments of the trust. The required payments if you like are all the expenses that must be met to keep the trust solvent. Points beyond the required payments aren't so much of an issue if they do or do not occur." [Mr Williams' witness statement]: "Q. Look please at 8.8 on page 574, was it your understanding shortly after 17 December 2007 that the ratings agencies would have a problem if the indemnity in respect of currency exchange appeared in (a) to (e) of clause .8? 
A. Yes because it was an unknown amount.
 
Q. But as you understood it the ratings agencies had no problem if that indemnity were dealt with in (f) onwards? 
A. Correct, but to satisfy the obligations of the swap is crucial to the notes being repaid." 
See also the email of 17 December 2007 1147am.
 [Mr Williams' cross-examination:] The defendant submits and I accept that none of those matters required the absence of a fully assignable uncapped funding indemnity. It would appear that whatever problem there was would not differentiate between an assignment of .9% of the notes and 100% of the notes.
 Insofar as Mr Williams gave evidence under cross-examination of wishing to protect against the situation where a new assignee might have an unlimited claim for an indemnity for currency costs, that evidence is not accepted as reliable.
 The matter generally related to Mr Williams' evidence that where HVB hypothetically would assign some but not all of the notes, he had an understanding that both HVB and the new assignee would be making a claim for indemnity for currency costs.
 Mr Williams' evidence was that he had anticipated that HVB's claim would be no more than approximately 12 basis points and drawn attention to his perception that in a situation of partial assignment, there would be a question of reasonable costs.
 When he was asked as to whether he had had any understanding or expectation as at 10 January as to whether the fact that HVB was still there, would have had an impact on what in a practical sense, the new assignee might be charging, his answer was that the costs should be in line with the costs that HVB had agreed to through the Costs Agreement of 16 January 2008.
 I formed the view during the hearing that the entirety of his evidence of this suggested concern was unreliable. The materials before the Court gave no reason to imagine that RAMS subjectively considered itself so exposed that it would not permit a continuation of the funding indemnity if there were an assignment of 100% of the notes: whilst it was prepared to have that exposure to an unknown assignee in an uncapped amount with 99% or all but one of the notes.
 In so far as the Costs Agreement was put forward it is important to note that this agreement was not made until 16 January 2008. It was not established that as at 10 January 2008 the parties contemplated that agreement. There was no evidence to suggest that as at 10 January 2008 there was any commitment binding or in principle by HVB to limit the collective indemnity under both agreements to 12 basis points. And even if it had been the case that RAMS had had some expectation that the Costs Agreement would be entered into, that would not have assisted the plaintiff's position with respect to the six months during which it was to subsist. It simply bound an assignee so that if
HVB purported to assign its rights under the Subscription Agreement with respect to some notes, the assignee of those rights would also take with it, this, in effect variation to those rights for the first six months. In short if it bound the assignee in that way for the first six months it would make no difference in terms of the total exposure to the funding indemnity as to who held notes and in what combinations. As Mr Speakman contended: 
In other words, compare three cases. HVB continues to hold 100% of the notes, situation one. Situation two, an assignee holds 100% of the notes.
Situation three HVB holds some notes and an assignee holds the balance of the notes in proportions that don't matter. In each of those three situations, for the six months during which this letter agreement subsisted, in respect of all of the notes the liability would be capped for the funding indemnity at 12 basis points. In other words it made no difference whether there was an assignment of no notes, some of the notes or all of the notes, the exposure of
RAMS would be the same, 12 basis points....
 
Now let's take an alternative hypothesis and that is that Mr Williams was not talking about the letter agreement but talking about something else. Now in our submission, in practical terms, RAMS is just as exposed with a 99.9 percent assignment to some mystery, unidentified assignee uncapped as it is with a one hundred percent assignment. And to suggest that there is some kind of moral suasion or as my learned friend put it, standard of comparison because the holder of one note has capped its cost at twelve-basis points in the six months, to suggest that that is some reason to oppose a one hundred percent assignment but not a 99 percent assignment... is a nonsense.
 
Why would three or four months into this process, the holder of 99.9 percent of the notes take any notice of what the parties had agreed would be a flat rate several months earlier? It is a nonsensical proposition in our respectful submission.
 
So the first stage is, it's off the radar. The second stage is, during the six months it makes no difference. The third stage is, what happens after six months? After six months this cap ceases, after six months and allowing for the parties contemplated the likelihood or at least the prospect, the likelihood that there will be a turning out, this facility may not go until , the maturity of the notes, accepting all that, there was obviously still a real prospect that the transaction documents would still be on foot, six months down the track. And six months down the track, the twelve-basis points caps has gone. There is no obligation on HVB to do anything in particular other than its contractual obligation to calculate in good faith and in a reasonably commercial manner.
 
There is no reason to think that that in any way would put a fetter on what an assignee might charge. So in the three situations I've posited, HVB holds a hundred percent. The second situation, assignee holds a hundred percent, the third situation some mix between HVB and an assignee in proportions that are irrelevant. It makes no difference, there is no difference between those situation to RAMS exposure and costs.
 
The Blakes drafts of 24 December 2007 in response to the Mallesons drafts of 17 December 2007 The Blakes drafts of 24 December 2007 in response to the Mallesons drafts of 17 December 2007 had the following features: i. The definition of Interest Rate in clause 13.2 of the Series
Supplement had been amended to read (b): "[a percentage per annum calculated by the Note Subscriber and notified to the Manager to be the Note Subscriber's funding cost for that
Payment Period in converting Euro funding (using the EURIBOR Rate on the relevant Rate Set Date) to Australian Dollar funding (using the BBSW Rate on the relevant Rate Set Date)] / [a percentage notified by the Note Subscriber to the Manager equal to the cost of converting Australian Dollar payments for that Payment Period to Euros, as if the notes had been issued in Euros]" ii. The Blakes drafts of 24 December 2007 otherwise relevantly maintained the position in the Mallesons drafts of 21 December 2007. Clauses 12 and 14.30 of the Subscription Agreement were unchanged.
 
The Mallesons drafts of 28 December 2007 The Mallesons drafts of 28 December 2007 had the following features: i. They were after Mr Williams had reviewed the Blakes drafts of 24
December 2008.
 ii. The drafts accepted as part of the definition of "Interest Rate" in the Series Supplement the paragraph (b) which Blakes had proposed in the 24
December 2007 drafts.
 iii. Clauses 12 and 14.30 of the Subscription Agreement were unchanged.

Conclusion with respect of the period between 17 and 28 December 2007 Ultimately a close examination of the above materials makes good the proposition that every draft passing between the parties between 17 and 28
December 2007 permitted an assignment of some or all of the notes and in their terms had a "currency indemnity" passing across to the assignee even where all notes were assigned.
 
Explaining the genesis of clause 10.7  The Blakes' drafts of 31 December 2007 had the following features: i. In the Series Supplement, paragraph (b) of the definition of
Interest Rate now had a cap of 11 basis points for the first time: "a percentage per annum (calculated by the Note Subscriber in good faith and a commercially reasonable manner and notified to the Manager) equal to the currency exchange and basis swap costs associated with the Note Subscriber funding its holding of that Class of Notes for that Payment Period using financial accommodated raised in Euros provided that the percentage per annum included in the Interest Rate by this paragraph (b) must not exceed [0.11%] for any Payment Period." ii. The Subscription Agreement now contained a clause 10.7 in terms similar to those ultimately appearing in the final document.
 The changes arose out of issues raised by the ratings agencies. See also emails of 28 December 2007 4:13pm, 28 December 2007 7:57pm, 29 December 2007 :02am and 31 December 2007 11:40am. The ratings agencies issues did not turn on any distinction between some notes and all notes.
 I accept that on the evidence the changes were proffered by HVB's lawyers.
The finding is that they had nothing to do with any requirement of the RAMS companies.
 
The inherent tension between clauses 12(b) and 14.30(b) Clause 12(b) of the Subscription Agreement provided: "The Note Subscriber may at any time assign its rights under this agreement and each other Transaction Document and transfer any Note in each case in whole or in part to any person without notice to or the consent of any other party." I further accept that the language of clause 12(b) is emphatic. On its face it clearly contemplates any combination of an assignment of some or all of the rights under the Subscription Agreement and some or all of the notes.
 In all of the circumstances there is considerable substance in the defendants contention that it is inherently implausible that the parties would have agreed: i. on the one hand to such an open ended right of assignment (including with respect to all notes and all rights under the Subscription
Agreement), ii. and nonetheless contemplated that if there were assignment of all notes, rights under the Subscription Agreement would be lost.
 I accept that this would create a nonsensical notion of assignment - an assignment which has the effect of losing the very rights which are assigned.
 Further Clause 14.30(b) of the Subscription Agreement is inconsistent with the tenor of Clause 14.23. That Clause was entitled "Rights and obligations to inure" and provided: "The rights and obligations of each party hereunder will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party's successors and permitted assigns." As the defendant has contended, Clause 14.30(b) of the Subscription
Agreement was also inconsistent with the tenor of clause 3.4 of the Series
Supplement, which read as follows: "The Notes will, upon issue, be in the form of registered debt securities, will be constituted under, and the obligations of RMS under the Notes will be constituted by, the Subscription Agreement, the Trust Deed and this deed and will be denominated in A$. The entitlement of a holder of a Note (as applicable) is determined by registration as a holder of that Note in the
Register of Holders in respect to the Series." (emphasis added).
 Clause 3.4 contemplated, in a sense, an "attachment" of the Subscription
Agreement to the Notes, which would be inconsistent with rights under the
Subscription Agreement terminating in the event of an assignment of all (but not some) of the Notes.
 
Was there a rational explanation for a clause 14.30 "carve out"? When one compares: i. the position of an assignment of all of the notes on the one hand and ii. an assignment of, say, all but one of the notes or of 99.9% of the notes on the hand, there simply is no practical difference between the two so far as concerns the costs to or exposure of the Originator and RHG.
 Nor did anything in any requirements of the ratings agencies produce any such relevant difference.

Subsequent conduct The principles concerning the receiving of post contractual facts on a rectification claim have already been set out. Ultimately the following analysis therefore holds true: i. The entry by the parties into the funding costs letter on or about 16 January 2008 is evidence of the parties' common intention (at 16
January) that HVB, as the original Note Subscriber, would be entitled to recover its currency exchange and basis swap costs under clause 10.7 of the
Subscription Agreement even though it did not "hold" any Notes. An inference may be drawn that the parties' intention was the same six days earlier when the Subscription Agreement was signed.
 ii. The conduct of Mr Tyndall in causing HVB to assign all of its rights to the Notes and its related rights under the Subscription Agreement is consistent with an understanding on his part that such an assignment would not result in the termination of those rights.
 iii. The letter agreement does not assist the plaintiffs' case with respect to the six months during which it was to subsist: a) The letter agreement bound an assignee, so it made no difference to the
RAMS's groups total exposure in the first 6 months how the notes were distributed as between HVB and assignees ie 100% HVB, 100% assignee or a split of 100% between HVB and assignees. As to Mr Williams' understanding, the answer at T111.30-.31 contemplates that an assignee would be bound by the letter agreement made 16 January 2008; there is no reference to a mere "standard of comparison".
 b) Alternatively, if the letter agreement were not binding on an assignee, a "99.9% assignee" was free to charge whatever amount was in "good faith" and "commercially reasonable" which need bear no resemblance to rates set by others at the beginning of a 6 months period.
 iv. The letter agreement lasted only for six months. After 6 months the funding indemnity was uncapped. It made no difference to the RAMS's group's total exposure after 6 months how the notes were distributed as between HVB and assignees ie 100% HVB, 100% assignee or a split of 100% between HVB and assignees.
 
The evidence of Mr Tyndall 
Mr Tyndall's state of mind The finding is that at the time of execution of the Series Supplement and
Subscription Agreement, Mr Tyndall had the following intentions and beliefs: i. "[I]f HVB assigned all of its rights to the Notes, then the
Subscription Agreement would not terminate and the assignee would get the benefit of RAMS' obligations under the Subscription Agreement." ii. "[I]f HVB assigned all of its rights to the Notes, then the assignee would be entitled to be indemnified for its currency exchange and basis swap costs (if any) associated with funding its holding of the Notes using funds raised in Euros." The finding is that Mr Tyndall was not conscious of the contents of clause .30 (b) of the Subscription Agreement. He was closely cross-examined on the process which he had adopted in his discussions with Blakes concerning the sundry proposed changes. He repeatedly gave evidence that he had not discussed all of Blakes' proposed changes with them: "They wouldn't draw our attention to them, they would actually give us the document and say - so they sent us the document, we wrote back the comments, we ticked or we wrote comments beside them, we sat down with them and we went through our comments and ticks at the time. And then when they - they said fine, we'll make those changes. We didn't sit down and go through every underline that they've done." [transcript 149] "[Mr Jenkins] would actually say, here's our suggested amendments and if you have anything contrary to them, please write against them and that's what we do. We'd write back and say, we're not happy with these or we're - you know, we want this and we'd write comments on them and John O'Brien and myself did that."[ transcript 149] "...they don't go specifically to each clause. No, they wouldn't do that." [transcript 150.4] "you don't go through line by line. You actually, your Honour, I take that back and my comment is, is that when you actually provide the documents, you get the documents, you write down your comments against them, you tick the ones that you think you're correct, the ones you think incorrect are like you write your - when you see the..(not transcribable).. you go through what you've written and the detail and then you leave it to them to finalise and send the documents over." [transcript 150.10] "Q. And you had discussed with Blake Dawson, in your meeting on 17
December, all of the proposed amendments which Blake Dawson had underlined in the drafts that were before you on 17 December; correct? 
A. No. We had talked about - and this is what we talked about yesterday - what they had issues with the documents and we talked about what we had issues with the documents, and then confirmed, you know, what was the view and instructions in regards to those issues." [transcript 190.29] "Well, we gave express instructions for the whole document, not just in relation to certain clauses. I mean, we essentially give them a terms sheet, they look at the terms sheet, they make the mark-ups. If we have any commercial issues we have along the way, we talk with them about it and then they send across - and still in mark-up they send it across to the other side." [transcript 192.4] Mr Tyndall's version is consistent with what was reflected in the Term
Sheet so far as assignability and funding margin were concerned.
 Indeed it is fair to say that one would not have necessarily expected Mr
Tyndall to have found Clause 40.30 [which lived at the back of the boilerplate clauses] when there was the emphatic assignment clause at clause 12.
 The finding is that his evidence was in general reliable.
 This is not to suggest that Mr Tyndall did not, on occasion appear to have some difficulty in explaining how he had differentiated as between: i. on the one hand, his focus on what the commercial issues were within the documents; ii. on the other hand, the proposition being put to him that his invariable practice was to read carefully through the draft that he was being given to execute.
 In my view he gave reliable evidence in the following two answers: 
Q. You didn't regard it as part of your responsibility to actually read any of those draft documents that had emanated between 24 December and 10
January, did you? 
A. No, I delegated that to our lawyers and the other people to do the sign-offs.
 
Q. Quite. And having delegated that, it was entirely their responsibility to satisfy themselves that the form of the final document corresponded with what was intended; correct? 
A. Correct, yes. [transcript 87] 
Characterising the significance of the evidence of Mr Tyndall An issue arose as to the relevance of Mr Tyndall to the proceedings.
 The finding is that in the circumstances which obtained, he was the relevant mind of HVB being clearly the most senior HVB executive involved in the negotiations. The finding is that he did not cease to be the relevant mind merely because he went on holidays in late December 2007. His cross- examination must be understood in context. In that respect the following propositions hold true: i. By the time that Mr Tyndall left, the drafting of the Transactions
Documents was near completion. Those commercial matters had been thrashed out over many negotiations since late September 2007. While Mr Tyndall may have regarded himself as having no responsibility for decision-making about drafting, he was the decision-maker on matters of substance, which matters of substance had largely been resolved by the time he left.
 ii. After 24 December 2007, he had some continuing participation: a) Mr Tyndall had several conversations with Mr O'Brien while Mr Tyndall was in Tokyo about the rating agency's requirements.
 b) On or around 2 January 2008 he participated in a conference call with
Messrs O'Brien, Goddard and Williams.
 c) On 10 January 2008 he ascertained from Mr O'Brien that required approvals within HVB had been obtained.
 d) Mr Tyndall gave this evidence: "John O'Brien would call me and I would have discussions with him while I was on my holidays and we would discuss various issues and then he would get my confirmation on them." e) Before executing documents on 10 January 2008, he confirmed with Mr
O'Brien that they were in substance the same as the draft Series Supplement and Subscription Agreement that he had reviewed on 21 December 2007 and that all internal sign-offs had been obtained.
 f) Mr Tyndall signed the Transaction Documents on behalf of HVB with Mr
Mueller. Of the two signatories it was Mr O'Brien who was the relevant mind of
HVB. The other signatory, Mr Mueller, was at the Risk Department at HVB in
Singapore. Mr Mueller's only role was "to go through and identify any risk components to do with triggers and the like".
 iii. Mr Tyndall only signed the Transaction Documents after he had confirmation from Mr O'Brien that they were "in substance the same" as the drafts which Mr Tyndall had reviewed on 21 December 2007 ie that there were "no material changes". Thus Mr Tyndall still had the "final say".

Mr Tyndall gave the following evidence: "Q. And you agree that it was no part at all of your responsibility to ensure that the document that you were signing corresponded to HVB's intentions; correct? 
A. Well, sorry, I confirmed with [Mr O'Brien] that it did, so I asked him.
I said, 'Have you got the sign-offs and, you know, does it reflect what was in the credit', and he said yes, he has confirmed it, he's got all the sign-offs.
 Ultimately Mr Tyndall's absence overseas furnishes a partial explanation for the mistake that was made: that is to say it was a contributing cause to clause 14.30 (b) remaining notwithstanding Mr Tyndall's intention as to assignability and indemnity.
 
The evidence of Mr Goddard Mr Goddard was clearly relevant mind of the plaintiffs.
 He had carriage of the negotiations of the term sheet. When day-to-day carriage passed to Mr Williams, Mr Goddard still reviewed at a high level to check for conformity with the term sheet.
 Despite earlier evidence in his witness statement and in cross-examination suggesting to the contrary, Mr Goddard ultimately agreed in cross-examination with key propositions as follows: "Q. And you understood at 10 January 2008 that the clause enabled the
Note Subscriber to assign its rights under this agreement, namely the
Subscription Agreement and if it chose to do so transfer all of its notes? 
A. To transfer the A dollar notes, yes.

Q. And you understood at 10 January 2008 that if the Note Subscriber did that combination of things the Subscription Agreement would subsist? 
A. Yes." There was no re-examination of Mr Goddard at all and therefore no attempt to explain what he meant by his answer.
 
Jones versus Dunkel and related considerations It is important to recall the so-called rule in Jones versus Dunkel <case>; [(1959) 101 CLR 298.] This may be summarised as follows: "The unexplained failure by a party to give evidence, to call witnesses, or tender documents... may - not must - in appropriate circumstances lead to an inference that the uncalled evidence would not have assisted that party's case. The appropriate circumstances exist where it was within the power of the party to tender the evidence which was not tendered." (JD Heydon, Cross on
Evidence, 6th ed, Butterworths, Sydney, 2000 at [1215]) "...This instance of a Jones versus Dunkel inference (Jones versus Dunkel <case>; [(1959) 101 CLR 298)], also available where there is unexplained failure by the party to call a witness or tender documentary evidence, can entitle the judge or jury more readily to accept the evidence of the opposite party which might have been contradicted, or more readily to draw any inference fairly available from the evidence called by the other party. A Jones versus Dunkel inference cannot fill gaps in the evidence, or convert conjecture and suspicion into inference, but unless it is to be empty of content the inference if drawn may weigh the scales, however slightly, in favour of the opposing party." (Adler v Australian Securities and Investments Commission <case> at <case> per Giles JA, Mason P and Beazley JA agreeing).
 Neither of the litigating parties saw fit to call on its solicitors who were essentially responsible for the drafting and iterations earlier dealt with in these reasons. Both sought to take advantage by reference to Jones v
Dunkel.
 Naturally the defendant had to discharge the onus of proof in relation to its rectification claim. It however contended that it had discharged that onus by reference to what Mr Jenkins had stated in sundry e-mails and by reference to the detailed corroboration in the term sheet, the drafting history and similar. The proposition was that a solicitor could discharge his or her responsibility to the client by providing a marked up document for the client to read by going through the important clauses [but not necessary by going through each and every clause].
 It is often difficult for the Court to treat with the submission that a
Jones versus Dunkel inference should be drawn against a particular party especially because that inference is not able to fill gaps in the evidence. In the circumstances which presently obtain it does not seem to me appropriate for the Court to do otherwise than to draw the inference that the respective parties determined not to call Mr Jenkins nor Mr Smith for the simple reason that the uncalled evidence would likely not have assisted their respective cases.
 At the end of the day there was sufficient material in evidence which emanated from the respective solicitors to permit the Court to determine the rectification issue: in particular the evidence of those who were called by the parties and the detail within the documents before the Court were of special assistance.
 The pervasive findings accept that a common intention of the type contended for by the defendant has been established. The reasons have already set out the inherently implausible proposition that the parties would have agreed: i. on the one hand to an open-ended right of assignment (including with respect to all notes and all rights under the Subscription Agreement); ii. but nonetheless contemplating that if there were an assignment of all notes, the rights under the Subscription Agreement would be lost.
 The reasons have also travelled through the inconsistencies between: i. Clause 14.30 (b) of the Subscription Agreement and the tenor of
Clause 14.23; ii. Clause 14.30 (b) and the tenor of Clause 3.4 of the Series
Supplement.

Title and standing issues As the pleadings make clear, the plaintiffs deny the entitlement of
Elektra to seek rectification of the Subscription Agreement, on the basis that
Elektra is not a party to that agreement, but an assignee.
 The entitlement of the party to the agreement, HVB, to seek rectification is also denied, on the basis that HVB has assigned its rights under the agreement. That is, if the plaintiffs are correct, the assignments of 18 July had the consequence that they became the only entities able to seek rectification of the Subscription Agreement.
 However as the defendants have contended the right to rectification of the
Subscription Agreement is a chose in action capable of assignment. Most likely, it was assigned by the Deeds of Assignment executed on 18 July 2008 as a right "under" the Subscription Agreement.
 Ultimately the matter was put beyond doubt by an assignment made during the course of the trial.
 In any event, each of Elektra and HVB had an interest in seeking rectification of the Subscription Agreement appropriate to be recognized -
Elecktra as assignee of the agreement, and HVB under its obligation (owed to
Lehman Bros, who in turn owe the same obligation to Elektra) to take all steps reasonably required to give effect to the transactions contemplated by the
Deeds of Assignment.
 
Good faith and commercial reasonableness The final bracket of submissions covered a number of extremely close and often complex technical issues. In each instance the approach taken by the defendant is accepted as pervasive and consequently adopted.
 
Construction of clause 10.7 and paragraph (b) of the definition of "Interest Rate" There are two issues: whether Elektra has funded its holding of the Notes "using financial accommodation raised in Euros"; the meaning of "currency exchange and basis swap costs".
 
Whether Elektra has funded its holding of the Notes "using financial accommodation raised in Euros" It is clear that Elektra acquired the Notes using funds advanced by
Arabella, that Arabella advanced those funds in Australian dollars and that
Elektra's obligation to Arabella is to repay in Australian dollars.
 The process by which those funds were raised was: i. Arabella issued Commercial Paper, denominated in Euros, sufficient to raise sufficient funds in Euros which, when exchanged for Australian dollars would allow Elektra to acquire the Notes; ii. Arabella entered into foreign exchange swaps, under which it exchanged the Euros raised by the Commercial Paper for Australian dollars; iii. Arabella advanced the resulting Australian dollars to Elektra.
 The terms of the foreign exchange swaps matched the terms of the
Commercial Paper. When the Commercial Paper falls due, the exercise is repeated. Arabella has entered into 22 swaps (and undertaken 22 issues of
Commercial Paper) since June 2008.
 Notwithstanding that the funds ultimately advance to Elektra are
Australian dollars, the finding is that Elektra has "used" financial accommodation raised in Euros within the meaning of clause 10.7. It is necessary to have regard to the Commissioning Agreement between Elektra and
Arabella. It was pursuant to that agreement that Arabella advanced funds to
Elektra.
 The Commissioning Agreement contemplates: i. that Arabella will request Elektra to acquire receivables, in this case, the Notes (Recital A); ii. that Arabella will issue Commercial Paper to fund those acquisitions (Recital B) - in this case, the Commercial Paper was issued by
Arabella in Euros.
 Albeit that Arabella issues the Commercial Paper in its own name, it does so "for the account (i.e. for the benefit and at the expense) of" Elektra: clause 2.
 Consistently with that, Elektra indemnifies Arabella against all of its obligations under the Commercial Paper: clause 7.1.
 In the light of those provisions, I accept that the issuance of the
Commercial Paper is properly characterised as a service provided by Arabella to Elektra, in order to allow Elektra to acquire the Notes. That is how the matter is described in clause 7.1 of the Commissioning Agreement (first sentence).
 An arrangement under which Commercial Paper is issued by Arabella in
Euros: i. for Elektra's account; and ii. at Elektra's expense, meets the description of Elektra "using financial accommodation raised in
Euros". It does not cease to meet that description because Arabella also arranged for the Euros raised on Elektra's account to be exchanged for
Australian dollars.
 Under the Commissioning Agreement, Elektra is liable to indemnify Arabella for Arabella's liabilities under the swaps: clause 7.1. Those amounts, for which Elektra is liable to indemnify Arabella, are costs "associated with"
Elektra's funding its holding of the Notes in the manner described above.
 
The meaning of "currency exchange and basis swap costs" Clause 10.7 of the Subscription Agreement and paragraph (b) of the definition of "Interest Rate" in the Series Supplement refer to "currency exchange and basis swap costs".
 There are two issues: i. Ultimately, it did not appear that the plaintiff contended that as a matter of construction FX swaps are not "currency exchange swaps". However, for the sake of completeness, an analysis must be made regarding the nature of the transactions that Arabella entered into.
 ii. Secondly, there is a broader dispute as to the meaning of "currency exchange and basis swap costs" in clause 10.7 of the Subscription
Agreement and paragraph (b) of the definition of "Interest Rate".
 
Analysis of the swaps Arabella has executed: were they "currency exchange swaps"? The swaps that Arabella has entered into are commonly referred to in financial markets as "foreign exchange swaps" or "FX swaps".
 There is also evidence that the phrase "currency swap" bears a technical meaning in financial markets. That meaning is: 
A derivative contract to exchange any type of ongoing payments which give rise to a foreign currency exposure.
 
For example, a cross-currency interest rate swap. [emphasis added] The FX swaps executed by Arabella are not "currency swaps" within that definition because they do not involve the exchange of ongoing payments.  Clause 10.7 does not refer to "currency and basis swap costs", it refers to "currency exchange and basis swap costs". While "currency swap" may bear a specific meaning in financial markets, there is no evidence that "currency exchange swap" bears a corresponding meaning nor, indeed, any technical meaning at all: i. "currency exchange swap" is not a term defined in the Glossary of
Terms published by the UK Association of Corporate Treasurers; ii. the phrase was unfamiliar to Mr Rush, who has 28 years' experience working in financial markets and as a financial risk management consultant; iii. Mr Witts thought the composite phrase "currency exchange and basis swap costs" was sufficiently broad to include incremental costs incurred when swapping via FX swaps, which tends to suggest he regarded FX swaps as falling under the umbrella of "currency exchange swaps".
 During cross-examination, Mr Witts eventually conceded that he could not find the composite term and that his definition was an "educated opinion".

Q. And it's correct, isn't it, that a Google search of the phrase "Currency exchange and basis swap costs" returns no hits in which that phrase is used, isn't it? 
A. That is correct and in that regard I agree with Mr Rush [transcript .16-19].
 ...
 
Q. It's not a term that you located in any of the glossaries of financial terms that you looked at, is it? 
A. As a composite term, no [transcript 469.32-34].
 ...
 
Q. So would it be fair to say that what you say in [section .1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s5.1.html) as the meaning of currency exchange and basis swap costs is really an educated opinion as to what the term must've intended to mean, it's not a statement of what you have in the past heard it or seen it is to mean? 
A. In relation to the basis swap costs that-- 
Q. No Mr Witts, in relation to the term "currency exchange and basis swap costs"? 
A. Yes, in relation to viewing that phrase in the context of the current issues [transcript 485.18-26].
 It would be misconceived to find that by using a phrase that appears to be a confusion of the two technical terms - "currency swap" and "foreign exchange swap" - the parties intended to adopt one technical meaning to the exclusion of the other.
 As the defendant has rightly contended, given that, on its ordinary meaning, "currency exchange" is synonymous with "foreign exchange", a reference to a "currency exchange swap" should be construed as including a foreign exchange swap or FX swap.
 That conclusion is supported by the surrounding facts: i. As at 10 January 2008, rolling FX swaps and a currency swap (such as a cross-currency interest rate swap) were alternative means by which HVB could have converted funds raised in Euros into Australia dollars. There is no rationale for construing clause 10.7 so as to indemnify HVB for the costs of one alternative, but not the other.
 ii. The finding is that as a matter of fact it was in the contemplation of the parties that HVB would use rolling monthly FX swaps.
 Mr Witts also acknowledged this synonymity in cross-examination.

Q. Sorry, I think you said a moment ago that in financial markets, "currency exchange" and "foreign exchange" can be used interchangeably? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. So that a currency exchange swap could be understood to mean a foreign exchange swap? 
A. Yes, or in shorthand, an FX swap [transcript 470.28-34].
 
The broader dispute as to the meaning of "currency exchange and basis swap costs"  There is a broader dispute between the parties over the meaning to be given to "currency exchange and basis swap costs" in clause 10.7. Essentially: i. Elektra says the phrase refers to the costs of entering into the swaps used to convert funding raised in Euros to Australian dollars; ii. the plaintiffs say the phrase refers to the incremental costs incurred when borrowing in one currency and the benchmark rate and swapping via FX forwards or basis swaps into a second currency, without incurring currency risks.
 Mr Witts purports to give expert evidence about the meaning of the phrase "currency exchange and basis swap costs" as a matter of "standard market usage". The finding is that the phrase has no specialised meaning in financial markets: i. in his 28 years' experience, Mr Rush has never heard the composite phrase used before this case; ii. the plaintiffs proved unable to point to a single document in which the phrase has been used outside the transaction the subject of these proceedings; iii. the term is not included in the Glossary of Terms published by the UK
Association of Corporate Treasurers, extracts of which are annexed to Mr
Witts' report.
 iv. Further even if the phrase was capable of bearing a specialised meaning in some contexts, it would appear that parties did not intend to adopt that specialised meaning here. It is significant that clause 10.7 requires: a calculation by the Note Subscriber; and v. that that calculation be "in good faith and a commercially reasonable manner".
 I accept as pervasive the defendant's submission that objectively, each of those things suggests that the parties did not have in mind some specialised meaning of "currency exchange and basis swap costs", especially if Mr Witts is correct and the specialised meaning results in there being only a single way to calculate those costs. There would, for example, have been no cause for Mr
Williams to be concerned about the costs an assignee might claim under the indemnity if those costs could only be calculated one way.
 In consequence it is appropriate to construed clause 10.7 by giving the words their ordinary meaning. In that regard, the construction advanced by
Elektra gives the words their ordinary meaning: i. "currency exchange and basis swap costs" are the costs of the "currency exchange swaps" and "basis swaps" associated with funding the Note
Subscriber's holding of the Notes; ii. there is nothing in the language of clause 10.7 that suggests the amount against which the indemnity is given is only an incremental cost, rather than an absolute cost.
 The Court may also have regard to the surrounding circumstances: i. The Notes were to be denominated in Australian dollars.
 ii. It was in the contemplation of both parties that HVB would fund its acquisition of the Notes by funds raised in Euros.
 iii. It was in the contemplation of both parties that, for the purpose of acquiring the Notes, HVB would convert funds raised in Euros to
Australian dollars through FX swaps or cross-currency swaps.
 iv. The parties may be taken to have appreciated that a party to a swap who effectively borrows (under the swap) in a high interest rate currency and effectively lends (under the swap) in a low interest rate currency, incurs a cost in doing so.
 In those circumstances, viewed objectively, the "currency exchange and basis swap costs" referred to in clause 10.7 are the costs referred to in point iv above.
 As the defendant has contended two further circumstances count against the construction advanced by the plaintiffs: i. First, the incremental cost described in Mr Witts' report is an amount that will always be driven towards zero by the activities of arbitrageurs. The likelihood is that the parties did not intend that HVB be indemnified against an amount that would be driven towards zero, especially when it is clear from clause 10.7 that the parties contemplated that the amount of the indemnity might exceed the 0.11% pa cap in paragraph (b) of the definition of "Interest Rate".
 ii. Secondly, the consequence of the meaning that Mr Witts attributes to the phrase is that HVB might incur a loss by holding the Notes, even when the cost of raising funds in Euros was less than the cost of raising funds in Australian dollars. Taking the month of October 2008 as an example: 
The interest payable on the Notes (at BBSW plus 0.80% pa) was $4,030,936.50.

According to Mr Witts, the "currency exchange and basis swap costs" for the month were $211,380.93.

Arabella's actual funding costs for the month were $4,640,401.78.

The result is that Arabella would have lost money by holding the
Notes that month: $4,030,936.50 +  $211,380.93 $4,242,317.43 -  $4,640,401.78 -$398,084.35 
Yet throughout the same month of October 2008, EURIBOR was below BBSW. I accept as correct the proposition that parties cannot have intended that HVB should lose money holding the notes in those circumstances.
 In regards to the first circumstance, Mr Witts, in cross-examination, had conceded that Arabella was never intended to act as an arbitrager in its dealings.

Q. But you are not suggesting, are you that Arabella has been acting as an arbitrager, are you? 
A. No.
 
Q. And the swaps that Arabella has entered into were not entered into as part of an arbitrage transaction, were they? 
A. No they were not in your definition of arbitrage and okay I accept in the arbitrage definition as well.
 
Q. When you referred to the arbitrage transaction, you're referring to the definition of arbitrage that you have extracted from the glossary of the
Association of Corporate Treasurers and appended to your report? 
A. Yes that's correct. [transcript 475.37-49] In regards to the second circumstance, Mr Witts confirmed that there could be a loss to HVB under his calculations.

Q. I accept that, but applying your definition of currency exchange and basis swap costs for this period, the amount received by Arabella and/or
Elektra would be insufficient to make up the difference between its - or their actual cost of funds and the interest on the notes? 
A. That is correct... [transcript 482.11-15] It is also legitimate for the Court to have regard to the heading of clause 10.7, although it cannot override the words of the clause. Here, the heading "Funding Costs Indemnity" suggests that the amount against which the indemnity is given is an actual cost of HVB, rather than a notional amount.
That is also consistent with the purpose of clause 10.7 being to protect HVB against an actual cost.
 
Calculated in a "commercially reasonable" manner There is no issue concerning the quantification of the indemnity charged to RAMS for the month of July 2008 ($67,941.70), as that amount was charged at the 0.12% pa rate that had been agreed on 16 January 2009.
 In respect of the other amounts in issue, the following table sets out the amount actually charged to RAMS and the different amounts that Mr Witts and Mr
Rush say ought to have been charged.

As the construction of clause 10.7 advanced above has been accepted, and Mr Rush's calculations are accepted, then the amounts claimed were less than Elektra was entitled to claim, so that the plaintiffs are not entitled to restitution.
 In respect of the amounts claimed between October 2008 and February 2009: i. Elektra has accepted that the addition of a further 11 basis points over and above its costs was an error.
 ii. Elektra has accepted the error identified at paragraph 15 of Mr
Rush's report.
 However and as the defendant has submitted, the net effect of those errors is that the amounts claimed by Elektra between October 2008 and February 2009 were still less than the amounts Elektra was entitled to claim, as assessed by
Mr Rush.
 In contrast to their reliance on the Witts Report, the plaintiffs sought to attack the methodology of the Rush Report, primarily on the grounds that its findings that the amount claimed under the indemnity provision compares the Australian dollar cost of funds on a fully covered borrowing with an unhedged borrowing, which is subject to currency risk. The plaintiffs contended that it is an invalid comparison according to standard market practice.  Mr Rush's cross-examination yielded a concession that the above assumptions Mr Rush made were incorrect: 
Q. Your methodology would mean that Arabella has an effective Euro cost of funds without incurring any currency risk, correct? 
A. Yes 
Q. The only way, I suggest to you, that Arabella would have an effective
Euro cost of funds would be if Arabella had an open, that is, unhedged currency risk? 
A. Correct. It would have the effect of the Euro cost of funds.
 
Q. And you agree, don't you, by the fundamental assumption, leaving aside the first two days, that Arabella in fact had fully hedged its currency risk? 
A. I do. [transcript 492.15-31] Notwithstanding this, these contentions do not assist the plaintiff's case. No such contention was advanced directly against the actual invoiced amounts. Rather, they were advanced against the Rush Report in light of the fact that the amounts calculated by the Rush Report are materially different from the actual invoiced amounts in any case.
 The final question is whether the defendant's calculation of the invoiced amount itself was commercially reasonable. I have dealt with the flaws in the plaintiff's arguments regarding the definition of "currency exchange and basis swap costs". However, this is separate and distinct from dealing with the actual amounts claimed by the defendants.
 One of the plaintiff's major points of contention was that the calculations were not commercially reasonable because a large number of costs that they alleged were not "currency exchange and basis swap costs" were included in those calculations. These included what were described as "credit loading costs" and "variability costs".
 Mr Witts acknowledged during cross-examination that the memorandum [3041A] explaining the increase to HVB's funding costs from 26 July 2008 contemplated cross-currency basis swaps and not foreign exchange swaps.

Q. I accept that. This memorandum contemplates a cross currency interest rate swap, do you agree with that? 
A. I think it's a cross-currency basis swap, yeah.
 
Q. It doesn't contemplate an FX swap, does it? 
A. No it does not.
 
Q. And the cross currency basis swap contemplated is for a period of six months through a year? 
A. Yes, I can see a reference to six months, I can't see the one year.
[transcript 483.22-31] The evidence suggests that a cross-currency basis swap is, in fact, a type of basis swap that appears in Appendix 5 of the Witts Report on page 39. The answer to the first question extracted above indicates that the words "basis" and "interest" are used interchangeably.  Further, in regards to the costs of the cross-currency basis swaps, Mr
Witts conceded that such costs would include variability and credit loading costs, which is inconsistent with his definition of "currency exchange and basis swap costs".

Q. And the cross-currency basis swap contemplates entering into a cross currency basis swap with a counterparty, the bank has regard to that counterparty's credit, do you agree with that? 
A. That is correct. [transcript 483.33-36] ...
 
Q. So that from the bank's perspective, something that is a credit loading cost may not be a currency exchange and basis swap cost, do you agree with that? 
A. Sorry, I thought you were saying "you do agree with that". Sorry, yes,
I do agree with that.
 
Q. But from the counterparty's perspective, the counterparty will simply see a single price? 
A. Yes, the counterparty would see the single price.
 
Q. So from the counterparty's perspective, the amount that the bank had charged for the risk that the bank takes in being exposed to the credit of that counterparty, from the counterparty's perspective, that amount would appear to be a cost of the swap? 
A. Yes that's right. You are suggesting, well - sorry.
 
Q. Do you agree with that? 
A. Yes.
 
Q. And so from the counterparty's perspective, variability costs would appear to be part of the costs of the swap? 
A. If they had in fact done the swap, yes. [transcript 483.44-484.10] The finding is that the variability and credit loading costs that make up part of the calculation enunciated in the proposal to increase the indemnity amount constituted "basis swap costs".
 The plaintiffs contended that the inclusion of such costs meant that the calculation of the indemnity amount was not commercially reasonable. The finding is that as such costs were valid "basis swap costs" their inclusion could not be said to be otherwise than calculations reached in a commercially reasonable manner.  
Good Faith It is well established that a duty of good faith does not require a party to subordinate the party's own interest so long as pursuit of those interests does not entail unreasonable interference with the enjoyment of a benefit conferred by the express contractual terms so that the enjoyment becomes (or could become), in words used by McHugh and Gummow JJ in Byrne versus Australian
Airlines Ltd [(1995) 185 CLR 410], "nugatory, worthless or, perhaps, seriously undermined" (Overlook versus Foxtel <case> at <case> per
Barrett J).
 Mr Tyndall and Mr Ulrich were the subject of the plaintiffs' attack. Of the two, Mr Tyndall bore the brunt of it.
 In relation to Mr Tyndall, two main criticisms are made by the plaintiffs.
 First, it is said that Mr Tyndall artificially inflated the costs charged to RAMS in order to pressure them into refinancing ("terming out") the Notes.
That submission is rejected.
 There is nothing dishonest or lacking in good faith in one party to a contract recognising that there is a collateral advantage to exercising a legal right under the contract. That is what Mr Tyndall did. Importantly, the contemporaneous documents show that Mr Tyndall was always cognizant of the requirement that the amounts charged to RAMS be calculated in good faith and a commercially reasonable manner as numerous instances of communications between him and his advisors explicitly express the need to calculate the amounts in such a manner.
 For instance, the very beginning of the memorandum regarding increased funding costs states that: ... HVB has a right under the transaction documents to change the funding cost percentage to any amount that reflects is currency exchange and basis swap costs for providing AUD funding to the client over a longer horizon than anticipated, as long as these costs are calculated in good faith and a commercially reasonable manner...
 A list of the references in the evidence to the steps that Mr Tyndall took to confirm that the amounts to be charged to RAMS were commercially reasonable makes the point: June 2008 
Sought legal advice from Allens Arthur Robinson on the content of the obligation to calculate amounts in good faith an a commercially reasonable manner  June 2008

Sought advice from Peter Berckelman of Barclays Capital  October 2008 
Sought advice from Brian Wong  October 2008 
Sought advice from Clive Parfitt  Amongst other things, Mr Tyndall sought advice from no less than six other people with experience in pricing swaps. As the defendant has contended the extensive steps that Mr Tyndall took are not consistent with charging an arbitrarily inflated price.
 The plaintiffs have submitted that Mr Tyndall intentionally included costs - credit loading costs and prepayment or variability costs - that he knew were not "currency exchange and basis swap costs" in the amounts charged to RAMS, the theory being that Mr Tyndall never told the people from whom he was seeking advice that the indemnity from RAMS was limited to currency exchange and basis swap costs.
 That theory does not withstand scrutiny. Firstly, it has already been shown that the inclusion of such costs was commercially reasonable. Secondly, correspondence between Mr Tyndall and his advisors indicates that Mr Tyndall referred very specifically to "currency exchange and basis swap costs".
 An example is an email from Mr Tyndall to Mr Parfitt on 27 June 2008: 
Dear Clive, 
It was good of you to spend time with me today, I have outlined the rationale to raise the basis swap and foreign exchange costs for the RAMS transaction. Could you give your input if this calculation is reasonable and includes all costs to be considered? I would ask if you could look at the opinion attached for guidance... [emphasis added] Another instance was Mr Tyndall's correspondence with Dr Petit on the same day regarding the same subject matter.

Dear Helmut, 
As discussed, we as note subscriber and financial advisor to Electra (sic)
No. 13, will advise RAMS of an increase in our fx and basis swap costs in
July as per our transaction documents. However, we are obliged to determine the amount in a commercial manner and in good faith... [emphasis added] This correspondence also suggests that Mr Tyndall's advisors were also aware of the requirement of good faith and commercial reasonableness.
 As regards Mr Ulrich, in relation to the amounts claimed in August and
September 2008, the contemporaneous documents support Mr Ulrich's evidence that he simply charged the amounts directed by Mr Tyndall. In relation to the amounts charged from October 2008 onwards, the finding accepts as reliable Mr
Ulrich's evidence that he believed RAMS was obliged to pay the amounts claimed. As Mr Tyndall was acting in good faith, Mr Ulrich, whose actions were completely in line with Mr Tyndall, also acted in good faith.
 The parties are to bring in short minutes of order.
