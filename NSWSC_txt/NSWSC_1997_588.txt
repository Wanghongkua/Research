HUGH JENNER WILY IN HIS CAPACITY AS LIQUIDATOR OF ABALNON PTY LTD versus FRANK LO PRESTI` ` 4048/95` `27 November 1997` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` 
JUDGMENT - On admission of statements in transcript before the Deputy Registrar 
HIS HONOUR: This is a suit commenced by a liquidator to recover what he claims are preferential payments made to the defendant by the company now in liquidation at a time when it was insolvent. The statement of claim seeks to recover a series of payments made by the company between 10 March and 4 June 1993. Two of these payments have ceased to be an issue in the case, but even so the claim involves about $117,000. 
Apparently one of the witnesses which the liquidator would like to call is a former director of the company, Vincent Lettieri-Barbato. The evidence shows that Mr Barbato, despite a search by the liquidator, has not been able to be found to give evidence. However, under section 597 of the Corporations Law or its predecessor, Mr Barbato gave evidence in the winding up proceedings /93 before Deputy Registrar Williams on 24 October 1994. Initially Mr
Chippindall of counsel for the liquidator sought to tender the whole of that transcript. I do not consider that that course can be taken, even if the remaining technicalities are put out of the way, for reasons I will give shortly.

Then Mr Chippindall sought to tender various statements in the transcript. To identify these statements, I marked in blue in the margin, on the copy that is "BB" to Mr Wily's affidavit of 11 September 1995, all the statements that Mr
Chippindall wished to tender. I then added an additional coloured line against most of the statements. Where there is no additional coloured line, it means that Mr Walton for the defendant objected to the material, but I thought that the matter was close to the borderline. Where a green line appears as a second line, it means Mr Walton had no objection to the admission of the statement.
Where a pink line appears, it means that Mr Walton had an objection and I did not consider that the material should be admitted. Where an orange line appears, it means the objection was that the material was unnecessary as it was already in evidence elsewhere or admitted on the pleadings. A yellow line means Mr Walton objected, but I thought I should allow the material.

Under section 597 of the Corporations Law, sub-section 14 provides that the transcript of the defendant's evidence on a public examination should be admitted in evidence in any legal proceedings against that person. There was no objection to Mr Lo Presti's evidence being admitted. The section says nothing about the admissibility of transcript of evidence of other persons. Mr
Chippindall referred me to South Australian cases of Duke Group Ltd versus Arthur
Young [(1990) 3 ACSR 147] and Duke Group Ltd versus Pilmer [(1994) 15 ACSR ], where transcripts of other persons were admitted under section 45b of the
South Australian [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ea80/). It seems to me that that section was different to the law in New South Wales even before the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) and that those cases give no guidance to courts in this State.

Under the general law, a statement made by a witness in one set of proceedings is not admissible in other proceedings; see British Thomson-Houston Co Ltd v
British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd [[1924] 2 Ch 160.] These proceedings are different proceedings to the winding up proceedings and it must not be lost sight of that a liquidator has a choice whether: (a) to sue in a court of common law, (b) sue by a motion in the winding up proceedings, or (c) sue in a separate suit in equity to recover a preference. The procedural reforms must not make a judge lose sight of the fact that these are essentially adversarial proceedings to recover a debt.

The evidence of Mr Barbato given in another place would inherently not seem to be admissible here though, of course, Mr Barbato could be called as a witness here.
 [Section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s63.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) provides that the hearsay rule does not apply to (a) oral evidence of a representation given by a person who perceived the representation being made; or (b) documentary evidence so far as a document contains the representation.
"Representation" is used in a very wide sense (see the dictionary to the Act).
Just as under the previous [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), it is not the document that is admitted but the statements in the document, but our law is different to the law in South Australia.

Accordingly, under [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s63.html) one must look through the relevant documents and pick out the representations.
That is what has been done by marking the relevant passages in the copy transcript with a blue line.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s67.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) provides that [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s63.html) is not to apply unless a party has given reasonable notice in writing of intention to adduce the evidence. That provision has not been complied with, as the notice has only been given very recently. Sub-section 4 of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s67.html) provides that even if notice has not been given, the Court may direct that [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s63.html) still applies, despite the failure to give notice. The Court then has to consider whether it will give leave under [section (4).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s67.html) 
As far as I am aware, the only reported case dealing with how this discretion should be exercised is the decision of Hill J in the Federal Court in Ming v
Uvanna Pty Ltd [(1996) 140 ALR 273] at 282.
His Honour seemed to consider that there were no guidelines in the Act as to how his discretion should be exercised, but thought that the real question was the prejudice to the parties by dispensing with the requirement of notice, including matters of expense and delay. As he considered there was no real prejudice, he allowed the material to be used, notwithstanding the failure to give notice.

However, in [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s192.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) there are some general guidelines set out as to what the Court considers when it is making a decision to give leave. Those matters are (a) to (e) in sub-section 2 and can be briefly summarised by saying the Court must consider the amount of time that would be saved or wasted if leave were not given, fairness to both parties, importance of the evidence, and whether it is possible to grant an adjournment.

Of those factors, it seems to me, in the instant case, that the key factors are fairness and the importance of the evidence.

Mr Chippindall fairly says that the liquidator has done all he possibly could to get the witness here and asks rhetorically: what more can the liquidator do? The answer to the rhetorical question is: "probably nothing", but that is not the end of the search because one must also look at the fairness to the defendant.

If the material was peripheral, then it seems to me that the factors set out in [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s192.html) would mean that there is probably little unfairness to the defendant in admitting the relevant statements and the recent cases do seem to have the flavour that the Court should tend to admit statements made under a public examination.

However, two caveats must be put on the statement I have just made. The first is that the defendant has had no opportunity at all of participating in the examination of the director concerned and, not only that, but very properly, in the context in which he was operating, counsel for the liquidator would have asked leading questions and put assertions to the witness which the witness just had to agree to. Furthermore, evidence can come out in the transcript in a form that would never be admissible if a question were asked in these proceedings. An illustration is the passage on page 13 of Mr
Barbato's evidence where counsel asks: "Now, when did Mr Lo Presti become aware of the problems in regard to the sale of the calendars?" 
That question would not have been asked in these proceedings and it contains some presumptions which may not be established. The witness then just said: "It was around March, February, March that I told him that the calendar business went awfully wrong ...".

Again, if Mr Barbato was in the witness box here, he would have to say the words that he addressed to Mr Lo Presti and not his summary of the conversation.

It seems to me that when the evidence gets close to the core of the case, that the Court has to decide if that sort of statement is unfair to the defendant and whether the unfairness outweighs the other factors.

The second problem is one that is not unique to this case. Under section 597 the witness must sign his depositions. In the early days these depositions were taken down by hand, read over straight away and signed with corrections.
Later they were taken down by a Court reporter in shorthand. However, nowadays a rather cheaper system is used of sound recording the evidence. Eventually the sound tape is transcribed, but often parts are not considered by the typist to be of sufficient clarity to be transcribed accurately. When the witness calls upon the Registrar and reads through the transcript, he or she may or may not agree with the transcript.

In many cases, and the present is one, one finds in the transcript the words, "Not transcribable" occurring. The witness is, accordingly, invited to include what was not transcribable and there appears to be very little to direct the witness's mind that he should be inserting what he actually said in the witness box and not that he wished he had said or that which he would say now if asked. The original transcript from the Registrar's office shows a large number of pencil corrections and it is just unclear whether they were what was said or what the witness now wants to say. There is little that can be done under the present system to deal with the problem where the witness does not properly authenticate the transcript. Probably counsel or the solicitor for the liquidator should retain his or her notes and be prepared to give evidence of admissions. This is, however, not in accordance with the principle that there should be one evidentiary record of the examination, the authenticated transcript.

There are also some defects in the actual signing of the material. Where there are a considerable number of alterations, as at present, if use of the transcript is to be made at a later time, even though there is expense involved, there is really little alternative but to correct the transcript and have the witness sign it in its amended form after reference to counsel for the liquidator and to the tape of the evidence, if still available, so that as accurate a record as possible is made and signed by the witness.

It follows that I consider that the passages that I have marked in pink should not be admitted and I do not give leave under [section (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s67.html) for the passages I have side-lined pink to be used. I will exercise my discretion so that the passages which are marked green and yellow may be used.
Those marked orange are just irrelevant and should be rejected on that ground.
The ones on which I have not made any second marking I think are really peripheral. My temptation would be to admit them, but I will hear further argument on this question if need be.

The reasons for giving this detailed judgment on evidence is that it is now :30 am. The Court will take its short adjournment. Counsel for the liquidator can decide during the short adjournment whether he wishes to press on, seek an adjournment, discontinue, or whatever.
 [At 11:50 am the hearing continued: the evidence not subject to a second marking was admitted].
