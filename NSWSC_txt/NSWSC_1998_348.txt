Opportunity Tribunal Matter No 30102/97 [1998] NSWSC 348 (22 May 1998) 
Last Updated: 15 September 1998 
NEW SOUTH WALES CASINO CONTROL AUTHORITY versus MARYANNE BIGNELL AND THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TRIBUNAL /97 May 1998 
Black AJ 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Administrative Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: In July 1995 Maryanne Bignell, the First Defendant, applied to the New South Wales Casino Control Authority, the Plaintiff, for a Special Employee's Licence. 
The First Defendant completed an application form in which she disclosed inter alia details relating to the man with whom she has been living since about in a defacto relationship.

The First Defendant attended two interviews with officers of the Plaintiff at one of which her defacto partner was present and was also questioned.

By letter dated the 15th January 1996 the Plaintiff notified the First
Defendant of the adverse view to her application expressed by the Director of
Casino Surveillance.

On the 6th February 1996 the First Defendant made oral submissions to officers of the Plaintiff.

By letter dated 29th February 1996 the Plaintiff notified the First Defendant of the Plaintiff's decision not to grant the First Defendant a Special
Employee's Licence.

On the 31st January 1996 the First Defendant complained to the President of the Anti-Discrimination Board alleging discrimination by the Plaintiff on the ground of marital status pursuant to [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/index.html#p4) of the [Anti-Discrimination Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/). That complaint was referred to the Equal Opportunity Tribunal, the Second
Defendant, on the 28th May 1997. The Plaintiff objected to the jurisdiction of the Second Defendant and, by consent, the Second Defendant agreed to deal with that as a preliminary point. On the 15th September 1997 the Second Defendant held that it had jurisdiction to hear the First Defendant's complaint.

From that decision the Plaintiff appeals to this Court. The Second Defendant has entered an appearance submitting to the Orders of this Court save as to costs.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/s155.html) of the [Casino Control Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/) provides as follows:- "(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a decision of the Authority under this Act is final and is not subject to appeal or review.

A person aggrieved by a decision of the Authority to cancel or suspend a
Casino licence or to amend the conditions of a Casino licence may appeal from the decision to the Supreme Court on a question of law.

The Supreme Court is to hear and determine the appeal and make such order as it thinks appropriate by reason of its decision, including, without limiting the Court's power to make such orders: an order affirming or setting aside the decision of the Authority, and an order remitting the matter to the Authority to decide again in accordance with the directions of the Court.

Proceedings for an appeal in respect of a decision of the Authority do not operate to stay the decision appealed from unless the Supreme Court otherwise orders." 
The Plaintiff contends that the jurisdiction of the Second Defendant is excluded by reason of subsection (1) above in that the Second Defendant would be conducting a review of a decision of the Plaintiff under the Act. The First
Defendant contends that the jurisdiction of the Second Defendant under the [Anti-Discrimination Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/) should not be regarded as being excluded without express or clear words and further contends that the Second Defendant would not properly be described as conducting a review of a decision of the Plaintiff in dealing with the First
Defendant's complaint.
 [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/index.html#p4) of the [Casino Control Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/) covers the licensing of Casino employees and, in particular, the procedures and statutory requirements involved in an application for a Special Employee's
Licence. In my view, the two sections in [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/index.html#p4) of particular relevance to this matter are [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/s50.html) and [52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/s52.html).
[Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/s50.html) provides as follows:- "(1) The Authority is to refer each application for a licence to the Director for report and recommendation.

The Director is to investigate and inquire into each application and report to the Authority recommending either that the application be granted or that it be refused.

If the Director's recommendation is that an application be refused, the
Authority is to notify the Applicant in writing of that recommendation and allow the Applicant at least fourteen (14) days to make submissions to the
Authority as to why the application should not be refused." 
This procedure was followed in the present case.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/s52.html) deals with the determination of applications and provides as follows:- "(1) The Authority is to consider an application for a licence and is to take into account the report and recommendation of the Director and any submissions made by the Applicant within the time allowed.

The Authority is not to grant a licence unless satisfied that the
Applicant is a suitable person to exercise the functions that the proposed licence will authorise the person to exercise.

For that purpose, the Authority is to make an assessment of: the integrity, responsibility, personal background and financial stability of the Applicant, and the general reputation of the Applicant having regard to character, honesty and integrity, and the suitability of the Applicant to perform the type of work proposed to be performed by the Applicant as a licensee.

The Authority is to determine the application by either granting a licence to the Applicant or declining to grant a licence, and is to notify the
Applicant in writing of its decision.

The Authority is not required to give reasons for its decision but may give reasons if it thinks fit." 
In the present case the Plaintiff declined to grant the licence and notified the Applicant in writing of its decision. It did not give reasons for its decision.

In my judgment, it is clear from the above that there has been a decision of the Plaintiff under the [Casino Control
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/) within the meaning of that expression in [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/s155.html) and it is now necessary to consider the meaning of the word "review" in that subsection. It is not further defined in the Act.

It was conceded by the Plaintiff that [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/s155.html) does not protect the Plaintiff from a review based on lack of jurisdiction or excess of jurisdiction and/or bad faith on the part of the Plaintiff. That concession was made in the light of what is known as the Hickman principle as discussed in Darling Casino Limited -v- New South Wales Casino Control
Authority, Court of Appeal, New South Wales (unreported, 8 November 1995), and in Darling Casino Limited -v- New South Wales Control Authority and Ors <case>; [(1997) 143 ALR 55.] 
The First Defendant does not contend that the present case comes within the
Hickman principle.

I also acknowledge the principle that I should be slow to find that provisions of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1997 have been excluded without express words or unless by necessary implication: see Darling Casino Limited - versus - New
South Wales Casino Control Authority and Others <case>; [(1997) 143 ALR 55] at pp 75-76.

In this matter I would emphasise I am not dealing with all of the provisions of the above Act but only the application of sections 39 and 44 to the
Plaintiff.

I take particular note of the following provisions within the [Casino Control
Act 1992](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/).
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/s140.html) and subsection (a) thereof.

The provisions of section 148 relating to secrecy.

The provisions of [section (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/s52.html) set out above.
 [Section (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/s141.html) which provides: "In the exercise of its functions, the Authority is not required to observe the rules of natural justice (except to the extent that it is specifically required to do so by this Act)".

The express provisions relating to other legislation namely: Schedule 2 relative to employment; Section 148(7) relating to the [Freedom of Information
Act 1989](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/foia1989222/); and the exclusion of the Plaintiff from the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman, [Ombudsman Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/oa1974114/) (Schedule , clause 23).

I also have particular regard to the following matters:- 
The passage in 6.2.1 of the Report of the Inquiry into the Establishment and Operation of Legal Casinos in New South Wales by the Honourable Sir
Lawrence Street which says: "It is desirable that the Authority have the confidence to exercise its powers, if necessary arbitrarily, in pursuit of its objects. It needs a wide discretion and needs to be free from the risk of legal challenges. On the other hand, this discretion should be balanced by greater accountability to
Parliament." 
The general terms of the Second Reading in Parliament.

Both of these matters were referred to by the Court of Appeal in their judgment in the Darling Casino case where they described the legislation as conferring quite exceptional powers upon the Plaintiff both in relation to the process of selection of the successful applicant for the licence, and in the subsequent operation of the Casino, the latter in my view being applicable to the present situation.

I was referred by both counsel to a number of cases discussing the meaning of the word "review" in various pieces of legislation. These included: Colpitts - versus - Telecommunications and Others [(1986) 9 FCR 52] at pp 62-64;
Appliance Holdings Pty Limited - versus - Lawson [(1983) 1 NSWLR 246] at p 249;
Nomad Industries of Australia Pty Ltd - versus - Commissioner of Taxation [(1983) NSWLR 56] at p 63; Powell re Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Co. Ltd.
[(1983) 3 NSWLR 183] at pp 187-188.

In my judgment the meaning of "review" in section 155(1) includes an examination of a decision by an entity which has power to make legally enforceable orders against one or more of the parties to the decision in the light of that examination.

It is accordingly necessary to consider whether the activities of the Second
Defendant in dealing with the First Defendant's complaint would come within the above proposition.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/s39.html) of the [Anti-Discrimination Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/) so far as material to the present case provides as follows: "A person (the perpetrator) discriminates against another person (the aggrieved person) on the ground of marital status if, on the ground of the aggrieved person's marital status or the marital status of a relative or associate of the aggrieved person, the perpetrator: treats the aggrieved person less favourably than in the same circumstances, or in circumstances which are not materially different, the perpetrator treats or would treat a person of a different marital status or who does not have such a relative or associate of that marital status." [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/s44.html) so far as relevant provides as follows: "It is unlawful for an authority or body which is empowered to confer ... an authorisation or a qualification that is needed for ... the engaging in of an occupation to discriminate against a person on the ground of marital status: by refusing ... to confer ... the authorisation or qualification." 
In Waterhouse - versus - Bell [(1991) 25 NSWLR 99], Clarke JA said of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/s39.html) of the [Anti-Discrimination Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/) at p 105: "The inquiry for which the section calls is a factual one involving essentially, two separate questions. The first, has A been treated less favourably than a person of different marital status was, or would have been, treated in the same circumstances, or in circumstances which are not materially different? The second, if so, was the ground of the differential treatment of those mentioned in (a), (b) or (c)?" [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/s113.html) provides that after holding an inquiry the Tribunal, the Second Defendant, may find the complaint substantiated and is empowered to make a variety of legally enforceable orders against the offender. It is clear in my judgment that in order to find the complaint substantiated by reason of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/s44.html) the
Tribunal would have to find that the Plaintiff refused to grant a licence to the First Defendant on the ground of marital status as defined in [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/s39.html)
That would involve examining the grounds of the decision made by the Plaintiff and in my judgment comes within the meaning of the word "review" in [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/s155.html) of the [Casino Control Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/).

I note that this conclusion is consistent with Fonua - versus - BHP and Others (unreported 21 April 1998), in which Bell AJ held that the Equal Opportunity
Tribunal is a court for the purpose of the res judicata principle. That issue was not argued before me.

The provisions of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/s52.html) of the [Casino Control Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/) are relied upon by the Plaintiff in support of a further argument that the requirements therein, and particularly of section (3)(a) insofar as it refers to "personal background" were in conflict with the provisions of [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/s39.html) and [44](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/s44.html) of the [Anti-Discrimination Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/) and therefore should prevail. In my judgment the terms of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/s52.html) assist in interpreting the meaning of the word "review" in section 155(1) as I have set out above but in view of the argument addressed to me about the matter, I think it is appropriate to refer to of Goodwin -v- Phillips <case>; [(1908) 7 CLR 1], in particular at page 7 where Griffith CJ says:- "That proposition is only an instance of a more general rule, that is, that where the provisions of a particular Act of Parliament dealing with a particular subject matter are wholly inconsistent with the provisions of an earlier Act dealing with the same subject matter, then the earlier Act is repealed by implication. It is immaterial whether both Acts are penal Acts or both refer to civil rights. The former must be taken to be repealed by implication. Another branch of the same proposition is this, that if the provisions are not wholly inconsistent, but may become inconsistent in their application to particular cases, then to that extent the provisions of the former Act are accepted or their operation is excluded with respect to cases falling within the provisions of the latter Act." 
As nobody, except the Plaintiff, knows what the reasons for the decision in this case were it is not possible to say that there has been an inconsistency, but it is possible in my judgment to say that there may be an inconsistency in the application of the provisions of [section (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/s52.html) of the [Casino Control Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/) and the provisions of [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/s39.html) and [44](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/s44.html) of the [Anti-Discrimination Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/). If such were the case then, in my judgment, giving effect to the above passage from
Goodwin -v- Phillips it may well be that the provisions of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/s52.html) of the [Casino Control Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/) would prevail. However, as I have said, it is not necessary to decide that finally because the reasons for the decision of the Plaintiff are not known.

In deference to an argument on behalf of the First Defendant I should add that, in my view, citizens of this State are not being deprived of all remedies under the Anti-Discrimination legislation against the Plaintiff in the conduct of its activities. This Judgment only relates to the question on the material before me whether the Second Defendant is entitled to consider the complaint about the Plaintiff's decision not to grant the First Defendant a Special Employee Licence. It does not deal with other aspects of the legislation.

Accordingly, I make the following Orders in this matter: 
An order setting aside the decision of the Second Defendant ("the
Tribunal") given on 15 September 1997 that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the complaint of the First Defendant against the Plaintiff.

A declaration that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint of the First Defendant lodged on 31 January 1996 that the Plaintiff may have discriminated against her on the grounds of her marital status in making a determination pursuant to [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/s52.html) of the [Casino Control Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/), by declining to grant to her a licence under [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cca1992166/index.html#p4) of that Act upon her application made pursuant to section 46 of that Act.

A declaration that the Tribunal ought to have dismissed the First
Defendant's complaint pursuant to [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/s111.html) of the [Anti-Discrimination Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/) on the ground that it did not have jurisdiction to entertain the complaint.

I will hear argument as to costs.
