JUDGMENT 
The applicant, Dimitri De Angelis, filed an interlocutory process on 22 June 2011 seeking an order for the termination of the winding up of Emporium Music Production and Distribution Pty Limited. 
His standing to bring that application was initially unclear, given that he said in his affidavit that he was a director and secretary of the company and said nothing about being a contributory or creditor, they being persons who, under [s 482(1A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s482.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth), are competent to bring a termination application. 
It later transpired, according to material tendered by Mr Hilliard, who has appeared for the plaintiff to oppose the motion, that Mr De Angelis had formerly had another name and, under that name, appeared from the company search to be a contributory. 
However, Mr Hilliard has now presented evidence to show that Mr De Angelis became bankrupt on 28 July 2011, with the result that the shareholding which might sustain his ability to bring the application is now vested in his trustee in bankruptcy. The trustee therefore represents Mr De Angelis for the purposes of the winding up "and is to be a contributory accordingly": [s 529.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s529.html)
It follows, in my opinion, that it is now the trustee in bankruptcy, not Mr De Angelis, who has standing under [s 482(1A):](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s482.html) compare Melluish versus Underwood Development Pty Ltd  <case>
The trustee in bankruptcy was given notice of the application but has not appeared to pursue it. Nor, indeed, has Mr De Angelis. He was made aware by the registrar by email sent on 10 August that the matter would be before the court today but he has not appeared. 
These matters provide a basis to make the order Mr Hilliard has sought, that is, an order dismissing the interlocutory process. 
I would add that Mr De Angelis has not filed any evidence going to proof of the solvency of the company. That is an indispensable element of any case for termination under [s 482](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s482.html) where, as here, the winding up is a winding up in insolvency. 
I order that the interlocutory process of Dimitri De Angelis filed on 22 June 2011 be dismissed with costs. * * *
