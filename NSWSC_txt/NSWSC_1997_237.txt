REGINA versus Emilio LOZANO 
HUNT CJ at CL: The appellant (Emilio Lozano) stood trial in the District Court on one charge of disposing of certain electrical goods on 29 December 1995, knowing that they had been stolen, and two charges of break enter and steal on 2 January 1996. He was found guilty on the first count and not guilty on the second and third counts. Judge Pain QC imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for six months. 
The Crown case depended to a substantial extent upon the evidence of one Shane
Johnston, with whom the appellant had told the police he had grown up.
Johnston was a heroin user, and he said that he committed a number of break and enters in order to feed his heroin addiction. He had pleaded guilty to three such offences which were related to those offences with which the appellant was charged. He gave evidence that, on 29 December 1995, he broke into a house with one Matthew Curtis and stole the goods which were the subject of the first count against the appellant. They had taken the goods back to his (Johnston's) house where his girlfriend (Natalie Palmer), the appellant and the appellant's brother were present. The appellant's brother left, and then the goods were split up between the appellant and Curtis for them to sell. They had left with Natalie Palmer in her car and had returned with heroin, in which Johnston shared. He said: "Emilio, Matthew and Natalie scored after they sold the stuff." 
In cross-examination, Johnston was asked: "Q. Did all four of you use that heroin? A. Yes." 
Johnston also gave evidence that the appellant had participated with him in the two break and enters on 2 January 1996. The appellant had broken and entered the houses whilst he and Curtis waited outside. The appellant had passed the goods out and they had hidden the goods whilst they returned to his (Johnston's) house in order to get Natalie Palmer's car. They had picked up the goods from one house and had sold it. When they went back to pick up the goods from the second house which they had hidden, they were caught by civilians but the appellant had managed to escape.

Natalie Palmer was called by the Crown. The evidence which was given is the subject of the first ground of appeal, and I will return to it presently.
Curtis was not called, as he had yet to stand trial. The appellant had been electronically interviewed in relation to each of the offences. He made no admissions. He denied having been involved in the events of 2 January, but he conceded that he was present at Johnston's house on 29 December when the stolen property was there. He said that he had not asked Johnston where he had got it from, but Johnston had bragged about how he had stolen it and how he had escaped when the owner had returned to the house. He had probably left his fingerprints there, he told the appellant, but the police did not have a record of his fingerprints.

The appellant told the police that he had not had anything to do with disposing of the property. He presumed that Johnston would have sold the property to support his heroin addiction.

The appellant did not himself give evidence in the trial, merely relying upon what he had told the police. His mother and brother gave alibi evidence in relation to the first count.

The first ground of appeal is that the judge erred in granting leave to the
Crown to cross-examine its witness Natalie Palmer. Ms Palmer had given a statement on 3 January 1996 in relation to the events of 29 December 1995, in which she had said that the appellant and Curtis had asked her for the use of her car but, as they were unlicensed, she had said that she would drive them to where they wanted to go. She had observed the two men place some items in the boot of her car, she had driven them to a house, the appellant had entered the house and then returned to ask her to drive the car into the driveway of the house, she had done so and the two men had then carried the items into the house. When they returned, the two men had told her that they had received $140 for their troubles.

Ms Palmer was called by the Crown as the first witness in the trial, which commenced on 19 August 1996 - or less than eight months after the events of 29
December 1995. She said that, as at December 1995, she had been Johnston's "girlfriend" and the mother of his child, she lived with him at his house, and she owned a car. She knew both Curtis and the appellant. She was then asked whether she remembered either the appellant or Curtis being at those premises at some time following Christmas 1995. She replied: "Sorry, I don't remember. At the time I was using drugs, I had a drug problem, and I haven't got much memory now of what happened around that time.
I've been trying all morning to, you know, bring something back, and I can't, my memory is just totally gone." 
She agreed that she had had the opportunity of reading through her statement made on 3 January, but she said that she still had no recollection of the events of 29 December.

Ms Palmer was asked what it had been since 3 January which had caused her to have no memory of those events. She said: "Well see, at the time I had a drug problem, and there's just a lot of things, not just this matter, there's a lot of things in my life that I can't remember, I don't have any memory of." 
She said that, when she had made the statement, her memory was "obviously a lot clearer at the time". She said that her drug habit had continued during the first half of 1996, but she had been on a methadone programme for three weeks by the time of the trial.

Ms Palmer did remember giving evidence in the committal proceedings on 13 May.
She said that she was still actively addicted at that time, but that she had had no trouble with her memory then. Although she said that she was now unable to remember anything which she had said in her evidence in the committal proceedings, she agreed that she had given evidence that she had driven the appellant and others in her car to a location. The Crown prosecutor accepted that the transcript of the committal proceedings recorded her inability at that time to recall being told by the appellant and Curtis that they had received $140. The inference is clear that she had been able to give evidence of everything else in May.

In cross-examination on behalf of the appellant at the trial in August, Ms
Palmer conceded that, on 13 December 1995, she had been convicted of a number of break enter and steal offences and of other offences involving false cheques. She had been ordered to perform community service, and she had been placed on a good behaviour bond. She agreed that when interviewed by the police on 3 January she knew that, if she had committed further offences following that sentencing, she would be in breach of that bond. She denied both lying to the police in order to stay out of trouble and in her evidence in the trial when she said that she had no memory of the events which she had described on 3 January.

The judge gave leave to the Crown to cross-examine Ms Palmer. It is submitted on appeal that there was no basis upon which that leave could have been given.
[Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s38.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) provides (under the sub-heading "Unfavourable witnesses"), by subs (1): "(1) A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness, as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about: evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party, or a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence, or whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement." 
The judge did not identify which of those preconditions for leave had been satisfied at the time when he granted leave. During the course of the argument, the Crown prosecutor conceded that he possibly had not established that the evidence which Ms Palmer had given was unfavourable to the Crown's case. That was no doubt because she had not said anything which was directly adverse to or which denied the Crown case or which could have been interpreted as attacking other evidence in the Crown case. There has been some debate on appeal as to whether that tentative concession was correctly made.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s38.html) was intended by the Law Reform Commission to abrogate the common law relating to hostile witnesses,[1] and the Act has been successful in doing so.[2] The word "unfavourable" which is used in the section (and which is not defined in the
Act) should not therefore be interpreted as necessarily requiring either the witness or the evidence itself to be hostile or adverse to the case of the party calling the witness, in the sense that the evidence denies that case or attacks other evidence upon which that party relies. In Regina v
Souleyman,3 Smart J adopted a dictionary meaning of unfavourable as "not favourable". I am content, too, to adopt that meaning.

Where, however, the witness has (as in the present case) asserted that he has no memory of events recorded at a time when the events were fresh in his memory, despite being given the opportunity pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s32.html) to revive his memory from the record, there may be a distinction to be drawn so far as [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s38.html) is concerned between whether the evidence which he has given is not favourable and whether the attitude which he has displayed towards the party calling him is not favourable. Both would appear to provide a basis for leave to cross- examine pursuant to subs (1), as the intention of the Law Reform Commission was to ensure that the courts are not deprived of relevant testimony which had been excluded by the operation of the old hostile witness rules.[4] Thus, if the judge accepts that the witness genuinely does not recall those events, then the evidence is not favourable, and par (a) of subs (1) is the appropriate basis upon which to grant leave.[5] If the judge is satisfied that the witness does not genuinely have any such recollection, then par (b) is the appropriate basis upon which to grant leave.[6] 
In my opinion, even if it were not open to the judge to accept that par (a) had been satisfied in this case, it was clearly open to the judge to accept that par (b) had been satisfied. The witness was able to give evidence about each of the matters recorded in her statement except one almost four months after having made the statement, but said that she had no memory of them just three months later. It is true that leave was granted before this evidence was given, so that the basis upon which it was in fact given may well have been insufficient. But, once that evidence had been given (if necessary, after cross-examining the witness as to her credit by leave granted pursuant to subs ), the conclusion that Ms Palmer was not making a genuine attempt to give evidence was clear, and the grant of leave was inevitable.

Both the grant of leave and the admissibility of the evidence in cross- examination are the subject of various discretions which permit a consideration of fairness to the party against whom the witness is called.
[Section (2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s192.html) is concerned with the grant of leave and refers to the extent to which the grant of leave would be unfair to such party. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s137.html) obliges the court to reject evidence in a criminal proceeding where its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. No appeal appears to have been made at the trial to the exercise of discretion. The only submission made was that the grounds provided by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s38.html) had not been made out, the argument being that Ms Palmer was simply not prepared to say on oath what she had told the police in her statement because it was not true. That argument was of no weight as soon as the witness accepted that she had given such evidence on oath in the committal proceedings.

It has been submitted on the hearing of this appeal, however, that the evidence should not have been permitted because its effect was to corroborate the evidence of Johnston that the appellant had taken the stolen property away in order to dispose of it. Notwithstanding that Ms Palmer could reasonably be supposed by the jury to have been an accessory to the offence alleged to have been committed by the appellant (in disposing of the property which he admitted that he knew was stolen), that evidence did have substantial probative value in the Crown case. It is true that no warning was given pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) in relation to her evidence as it was in relation to Johnston's evidence (and the judge was not asked to give it), but the jury could hardly have failed to interpret that warning as applicable to all persons whom they reasonably supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the prosecution.

Evidence is not prejudicial to an accused person in the relevant sense of these discretions if all that the evidence does is to establish the Crown case.[7] Nor did the appellant claim that the witness could not effectively be cross-examined because of her professed loss of memory, no doubt because the obvious answer to such a claim (once she had in fact given that evidence in the committal proceedings) was that her professed loss of memory resulted from the fact that she was very much in his camp. In any event, the judge was not asked to exercise any discretion upon that basis.

Although it is not within the first ground of appeal, it has also been argued that the judge should (pursuant to [s )](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html) have limited the use to which the evidence adduced in cross-examination could be put by the Crown. Both counsel appear to have assumed (at least at one stage or another) that, in accordance with the common law, that evidence did not establish the truth of what was said,[8] whereas the effect of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s60.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) is to make it evidence of the truth.[9] When dealing with Ms Palmer's evidence, the judge did not draw the jury's attention to what had been adduced by the Crown in cross-examination. He merely said: "She [Ms Palmer] told you about a drug problem she had which she subsequently said had caused her to lose any recollection of events about that time, and you recall she was briefly cross-examined, but it appears to be agreed between both counsel that she does not really take the matters with which you are concerned anywhere in this case. But no doubt the Crown felt it incumbent upon them to call her as being a person who at any rate at some stage appeared able to provide some information in relation to the matters." 
And the judge later remarked that "it seems to be agreed that Natalie Palmer does not contribute anything positive to this matter". But, in between those two remarks, the judge did say this: " ... the Crown submitted to you that she [Ms Palmer] had in fact implicated herself and had conceded that she had driven them [the appellant and Curtis] there to dispose of the property." 
As the judge did not expressly direct the jury that the evidence was relevant only to the witness's credit, there is a real prospect that they would have considered what she had told the police as evidence of the truth of what was said. Prior to the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), a trial judge's failure to give a direction limiting the use of such evidence could in some circumstances be the basis for quashing a conviction.[10] Since the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), however, an application must first be made for the use of such evidence to be limited. None was made in this case.

In my view, Ms Palmer's statement to the police itself was in any event admissible as evidence of the truth pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) of the Act, one of the "first hand hearsay" provisions.[11] No notice was required by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s67.html), but in any event the witness's statement would have been served as part of the police brief. Its probative force was that it established that the appellant did, contrary to his denial, dispose of the property which he knew was stolen.
It did not establish anything prejudicial to the appellant in the relevant sense. The discretion provided by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s137.html) would therefore not be applicable. No reason was shown as to why the use to be made of the evidence under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s66.html) should have been limited pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s136.html), and (as I have already pointed out) no application was made for that power to be exercised.

I would reject the first ground of appeal.

The second ground of appeal asserts that the judge erred in allowing the Crown to cross-examine the appellant's mother and brother "relating to an alleged addiction of drugs by [him]".

The evidence given by the appellant's mother over objection did not establish any such addiction. She said that she did not know that he had a drug problem, and that she had never heard of any heroin addiction on his part. His brother, however, agreed (also over objection) that the appellant had a heroin problem in the past, but he said that it had ceased three or four years prior to these events.

Those facts adduced from the appellant's brother were already in evidence in the case, the appellant himself having told the police that heroin had previously nearly destroyed his life. He had given that addiction as the reason why he had not wanted to have anything to do with Shane Johnston (who was a user of heroin) on 2 January, when the offences charged in the second or third counts were committed by Johnston and Curtis and (it was alleged) by the appellant. That statement was contained in one of the three electronically recorded interviews tendered, without objection, by the Crown.[12] 
The Crown was entitled, in those circumstances, to attempt to establish that the appellant had not been reluctant to go with Johnston on that occasion and, in order to do so, to attempt to establish that the appellant was still a user of heroin at that time. The questions of both his mother and his brother were directed specifically to that fact, although the Crown was not successful in obtaining an answer from either of them confirming that he was still using heroin at that time. That particular fact was actually established by counsel for the appellant during the cross-examination of Johnston in the passage which I have already quoted, apparently quite deliberately.

As the evidence was admissible for that purpose, it was not excluded by [Pt .6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.6) notwithstanding that it may have tended to prove a matter which that Part excludes. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s95.html) would nevertheless prevent the evidence being used as tendency evidence if it were not otherwise made admissible pursuant to [Pt .6.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p3.6)
No direction was sought that the evidence could not be used for that purpose.
Nor was it evidence which could have been excluded pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s137.html) because it was already before the jury in the way I have outlined.

It was submitted by the Crown at the trial that the evidence of the appellant's current drug addiction was in any event relevant to motive. That is undoubtedly true, although questions of discretion would inevitably be of some importance, as would the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s95.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). It was argued by the appellant that, because evidence of motive is part of the Crown case and because it had not been led during the course of the Crown case, it could not be adduced by cross-examination of the witnesses called in the appellant's case. I do not accept the appellant's argument. Motive was not an ingredient of the offence which had to be proved by the Crown. It was, however, an issue which the Crown was entitled to establish as supporting its case. If the appellant's argument were correct, it would mean that the Crown prosecutor would not be entitled to cross-examine an accused person in order to support the Crown case. That is simply not correct.

As to the Crown's argument at the trial, this evidence was never put to the jury as demonstrating motive. In those circumstances, it is unnecessary to determine whether the evidence would have been admissible on that basis. The fact is, the evidence was already before the jury and was admissible upon a different issue.

I would reject the second ground of appeal as well.

The third ground of appeal asserts that the guilty verdict on the first count was inconsistent with the verdicts of not guilty on the other two counts. The appellant accepts that he must persuade this Court that there is no reasonable explanation for what otherwise may appear to be an inconsistency and thus that the different verdicts result from a compromise amongst the jurors.[13] The appellant argues that the Crown case in relation to all three counts depended upon the evidence of Johnston, which must necessarily have been disbelieved by the jury when finding him not guilty of the second and third counts, and there was no distinction which could have been made between the three.

I do not accept that argument. The judge gave the jury a strong accomplice warning concerning Johnston's evidence in accordance with [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). He pointed out that the Crown case relied "significantly and heavily" upon that evidence.
He explained in the usual terms why an accomplice's evidence may be unreliable, and he warned the jury that Johnston's evidence may for that reason be unreliable. He directed the jury, in one place, that they must approach his evidence with "considerable" caution and, in another place, with "great" caution. He did not suggest, as he could have, that the jury may look to see whether there was other evidence in the case which supported his evidence. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s164.html) abolishes any requirement of corroboration, but it does not make the existence of other evidence supporting the accomplice's evidence irrelevant to whether that evidence should be accepted. (If attention is drawn to such evidence, it is preferable that the word "corroborate" not be used, if only to prevent arid arguments arising as to whether that evidence amounted to corroboration at common law.) 
The jury were not bound to ignore Ms Palmer's evidence because of the judge's reference to the apparent agreement between counsel that her evidence did not add anything to the case. As I have already pointed out, the judge also referred to the Crown's submission that she had implicated herself when she conceded that she had driven the appellant and Curtis when they disposed of the property. Her evidence directly established the appellant's guilt of the first count.

Moreover, the version which the appellant gave to the police conceded that he was present at Johnston's house when the stolen property was there and that
Johnston had told him that it was stolen. All that is missing from that interview to establish the appellant's guilt of the first count is an admission that he disposed of that property. Yet, in the interview relating to one of the subsequent break enter and steal charges, the appellant conceded that it was to him whom Johnston had turned in order to assist him with the property which had been stolen in that offence, although the appellant claimed that he had replied that, whatever they were doing, he wanted nothing to do with it. And, in the interview relating to the other of the subsequent break enter and steal charges, the appellant told the police that Johnston had asked him if he were interested in purchasing the property which had been stolen in that offence. According to the summing up, the Crown had submitted to the jury in relation to the first count: " ... if Johnston and Curtis were the only two who had undertaken these offences, then could you not ask the rhetorical question, why would Johnston later ask the accused for help if they had managed without him earlier?" 
Both of these matters added support to Johnston's evidence in relation to the first count. There was no such support in relation to the other two counts. It was quite appropriate, therefore, for the jury (having in mind the warning which had been given) to have accepted Johnston's evidence in relation to the first count but not that in relation to the other two counts.

I am not satisfied that there was any compromise in this case. I would reject the third ground of appeal as well.

The fourth ground of appeal is that the verdict of guilty was unsafe and unsatisfactory because the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt as to
Johnston's reliability and credibility. The appellant relies upon his denial to the police that he had disposed of the goods which he knew were stolen, together with the alibi evidence of his mother and his brother. The appellant's statement to the police was not on oath, nor was it subject to cross-examination. It would have been appropriate for the judge to have given a warning to the jury concerning that statement in accordance with [s (1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s165.html)
In any event, the absence of sworn evidence from the appellant is relevant to any consideration of an unsafe and unsatisfactory ground of appeal.[14] 
The appellant's mother gave evidence that she had made a paella for dinner on December 1995, and she had asked the appellant and his brother to come home early to eat it. They had arrived home at about 5.30 pm. She agreed in cross- examination that this was a dish which she made many times. The appellant's brother gave evidence that the appellant had left Johnston's house with him and had returned home with him for dinner, which was a paella which their mother was cooking for them as they would not be home for New Year's Eve. He had only been asked to recall the events a week and a half before the trial, although he did give evidence of having seen Johnston arrive at his home that day with electrical equipment in his car. I do not regard that fact as adding any particular weight to the brother's evidence.

I have considered the whole of the evidence in the case, and made my own independent assessment of its sufficiency and quality. I see no basis upon which the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt. The evidence of his family certainly does not suggest to me that there is any significant possibility that an innocent man has been convicted.[15] In my view, the Crown case on the first count was a strong one, for the reasons to which I referred in relation to the third ground of appeal.

I would accordingly reject this last ground of appeal also. I propose that an order be made dismissing the appeal against conviction.

An application has been made for leave to appeal against sentence.

The judge accepted that the offence of which the appellant was convicted was at the lower end of the scale of gravity for a receiving offence. He did, however, take the appellant's prior record into account. The appellant, who is only twentyseven years of age has a criminal record which extends back nine years and which includes many offences of dishonesty. In 1989, he received a fixed term of six months for three offences of break enter and steal and two of stealing, but on appeal this was reduced to a bond for a period of three years, on condition that compensation of $1885 was paid. Within five months he had a conviction for receiving for which he received periodic detention. Two months later, there were two convictions for stealing for which he was fined.
Six months later, he was convicted of armed robbery in company, although he received a fixed term of penal servitude for only three months. In June of last year, he was convicted of armed robbery, and received a sentence of penal servitude for six years, consisting of a minimum term of four years and an additional term of two years. He had used up every chance which he had been given for leniency. He was serving that minimum term at the time of his trial for the present offence. The judge accumulated the fixed term of six months upon that minimum term.

It is submitted that the judge failed to give sufficient weight to the principle of totality when accumulating this sentence upon the minimum term of four years which the appellant was already serving, and that the accumulation interfered with the additional term imposed, so denying him the benefit of that lengthy period of parole.

The judge emphasised the need to take totality into account in the circumstances of this case. In my view, the term of six months imposed by the judge was extremely lenient for an offender with the record which the appellant has, so that it is clear that he sufficiently took the principle of totality into account by imposing a cumulative sentence of only six months.
The judge could not have delayed the commencement of the fixed term beyond the expiration of that minimum term. It would not have been appropriate to make it concurrent.

I propose that leave to appeal against sentence be refused.

PROPOSED ORDERS
The appeal against conviction is dismissed.
Leave to appeal against sentence is refused.

SPERLING J: I would just like to add a brief comment of my own in relation to the operation of [s 38(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s38.html) The subsection provides, in par (a), that a party who has called a witness may, with the leave of the Court, cross-examine that witness about evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party. 
In this case Ms Palmer said that she did not remember the occasion in question. She had however made an earlier statement concerning her presence and involvement in relation to that occasion.

There was debate on the hearing of the appeal as to whether the evidence given by Ms Palmer that she did not recall the occasion was "unfavourable" to the
Crown within the meaning of the section.

I am myself undecided as to whether it was or whether it was not. However, assuming for the purpose of the argument that it was unfavourable evidence within the meaning of the section, Ms Palmer could then, subject to subs (3), only have been cross-examined in reliance upon par (a) about the evidence she had given; that was her evidence, that she had no recollection of the occasion in question. Again subject to subs (3), leave would not have justified cross- examination on anything else.

However, I agree with what has been said by the Chief Judge about the application of par (b) of subs (1). Accordingly, for the purpose of the present appeal, the observations I have made are not determinative of the result.

I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Judge and with the reasons that he has given.

BARR J: I agree with the Chief Judge.
