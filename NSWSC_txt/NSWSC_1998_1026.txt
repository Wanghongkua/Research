Studdert J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Administrative Law Division, Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: In each of these matters the plaintiff seeks an order pursuant to [s 134](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s134.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/), requiring a magistrate before whom committal proceedings are pending to reconsider applications made to him under <case> of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/). In each case the learned magistrate has filed an appearance submitting to the orders of this Court but the relief sought is opposed by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. 
The plaintiff, Boris Mileshkin, is one of a number of doctors conducting a group medical practice known as the Southern Cross Medical Centre. The plaintiff, Nader Hanna, is not a doctor but he was a part owner of the medical centre, working there at times relevant for present purposes. Each plaintiff is one of four defendants, the remaining two defendants being doctors at the centre.

Each plaintiff has been charged with many offences: 
Dr Mileshkin has been charged with 110 offences against <case> of the
Commonwealth Crimes Act and eighty offences against <case> of that statute; 
Mr Hanna has been charged with 191 offences against the same statute. In his case, again the relevant provisions are ss 29A and 29D.

The plaintiffs were served with copies of statements from those witnesses upon whom the prosecution relies pursuant to the statutory scheme found in Part 4
Division 1 Sub-Division 7A of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/). In all, 129 statements were served. Each plaintiff was given notice as required by <case> of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/) and subsequently made application to the magistrate conducting the committal proceedings for directions pursuant to <case> of the Act, requiring the attendance before that magistrate of a number of the makers of statements, so as to permit of their cross-examination on committal. The magistrate directed the attendance only of Dr Ram Iyengar but otherwise refused the applications and hence the present summonses.

The offences charged have generally been described as Medicare frauds, and they concern claims for payment of health fund benefits where the prosecution alleges no entitlement to the payment of such benefits existed. The services the subject of the various charges were allegedly only in the nature of health screening services which did not correctly attract the payment of benefits. As the prosecution has been outlined before this Court, it turns upon the types of claim that were allowable for medical procedures between 1990 and 1994.
Procedures carried out at the relevant medical centre included stress test procedures and the prosecution contends no claims for benefits ought to have been advanced in respect of these tests because they were not allowable as medically necessary under Medicare ministerial guidelines. This is a contentious issue and each plaintiff before this Court asserts that there was no dishonesty in the presentation of any one of the claims to which the various charges relate.

The plaintiff Mr Hanna sought a direction under <case> concerning the makers of nineteen of the statements served and the plaintiff Dr Mileshkin in relation to eight statement makers. There was considerable overlap in the applications, there being potentially five witnesses common to both applications. The purposes for which cross-examination was sought were varied, and indeed differed from witness to witness, but I shall return to this later.

Before considering <case> it is necessary to address the limitations upon the nature of the relief available under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s134.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/). The section does not provide for general appeal on questions of law, but provides for relief in the nature of mandamus: see Waterhouse versus Gilmore (1988) 12
NSWLR esp at 277 and Saffron versus DPP [(1989) 16 NSWLR 397.] It suffices for present purposes that I refer to the judgment of Priestley JA in the latter case where the relevant principles were summarised. His Honour said (at 418): "...such relief (that is relief in the nature of mandamus pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s134.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/)) could only be granted if it appeared that the magistrate had not really performed the duty imposed upon him by the statutory provision under which he was acting, in this case the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/), [s41(6).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s41.html) In a decision which has been many times followed in this Court, Ex parte Hebburn
Ltd; Re Kearsley Shire Council <case>; [(1947) 47 SR 416]; [64 WN 107], Jordan CJ illustrated the difference between a real, although possibly mistaken, performance by a magistrate of the duty imposed on him and a performance of that duty which was not relevantly real, called by him a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction. He made two principal points (at 420; 109).
A magistrate may make a mistake of law, even as to the proper construction of a statute without constructively failing to exercise jurisdiction.
A mistake of law as to the proper construction of the statute investing a magistrate with jurisdiction which leads the magistrate to misunderstand the nature of the jurisdiction so that (i) he applies a wrong and inadmissible test or (ii) misconceives his duty or (iii) does not apply himself to the question which the law prescribes or (iv) misunderstands the nature of the opinion he must form, will make the magistrate's decision one given in a purported and not a real exercise of jurisdiction." 
With the above considerations in mind, I address <case> and the approach taken by the learned magistrate.

Section 48E is in the following terms: "(1) For the purposes of committal proceedings, the Justice or Justices may give a direction requiring the attendance at the proceedings of a person who has made a written statement for the purposes of this Subdivision. The direction may be given on the application of the defendant or informant or on the motion of the Justice or Justices.

The Justice or Justices may give the direction only if: in the case of a witness in proceedings that relate to an offence involving violence who is the alleged victim of the offence - the Justice or
Justices are of the opinion that there are special reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give oral evidence, or in any other case - the Justice or Justices are of the opinion that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give oral evidence.

The Justice or Justices must not give the direction if the written statement has already been admitted as evidence.

A defendant may apply for a direction under subsection (1) only if the defendant has served on the informant, within such period as the Justice or
Justices may direct, a notice that the defendant wishes the person who made the statement to attend at the proceedings.

If a direction has been given under subsection (1), the statement is not admissible as evidence under section 48A in the proceedings, unless the direction has been withdrawn.

A direction given under subsection (1) on the application of a defendant or informant may be withdrawn only on the application, or with the consent, of the applicant.

If the Justice refuses or Justices refuse to give a direction under subsection(1), the Justice or Justices must give reasons for doing so.

The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the determination of special reasons under subsection (2)(a) and the determination of special reasons under subsection (2)(b).

In this section: offence involving violence means any of the following offences (except an offence to the extent that it is listed in Table 1 to [Part
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/index.html#p9a) of the [Criminal Procedure Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1986188/)): a prescribed sexual offence within the meaning of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), an offence under [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s27.html)-[30](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s30.html) of that Act (attempts to murder), an offence under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s33.html) of that Act (wounding etc with intent to do grievous bodily harm or resist arrest), an offence under [section (b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s35.html) of that Act (infliction of grievous bodily harm), an offence under [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s86.html)-91 of that Act (abduction or kidnapping), an offence under [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s94.html)-[98](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s98.html) of that Act (robbery), any other offence that involves an act of actual or threatened violence that is prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this section." 
In the present cases each plaintiff made application as required by <case>, and none of the relevant statements have yet been admitted as evidence, so s
E(3) does not apply. No issue arises under <case>.

Section 48E(2) draws a distinction between offences involving violence and other offences. In the former category there must be shown to be "special reasons why, in the interests of justice" a witness allegedly a victim of the offence should attend to give oral evidence. However in all other cases what is required is that there be "substantial reasons why in the interests of justice" a witness should attend.

What constitutes "special reasons" for the purposes of the earlier but similar <case> of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/) was considered in B versus Gould & Anor [(1993) 67 A Crim R 297] and in R versus Kennedy (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 1 September 1997).
Presumably reasons which would qualify as "special" would also qualify as "substantial", as the requirement of "substantial" reasons set by s
E(2)(b) is a less demanding requirement than that set in cases to which s
E(2)(a) applies. It is understandable that the legislature has drawn a distinction between witnesses concerned with offences involving violence and those that are not. Whilst the streamlining objective behind <case> is not only directed to crimes of violence, in those cases there are presumably the additional objectives of avoiding undue exposure of a witness to whom [s (2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s48.html) applies to the ordeal of giving evidence more than once and also the protection of such a witness.

In the Second Reading Speech in relation to the Bill introducing <case>, the
Attorney General said as to the concept of substantial reasons: "As I have indicated, the phrase `substantial reasons' is intended to bring about a less stringent test than that which has been developed under the current section 48EA. The precise scope of the phrase will of course be subject to judicial interpretation. It would be unhelpful to attempt to exhaustively define it in the bill.

It is envisaged however that if cross-examination would be likely to result in discharge of the defendant pursuant to [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s41.html) or [41](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s41.html)(6) that this would amount to `substantial reasons... In the interests of justice'.
Similarly, the phrase would be expected to apply where there is a likelihood that cross-examination would demonstrate grounds for a no-bill application.

Another situation where `substantial reasons' may be held to apply would arise where it appears that cross-examination is likely to substantially undermine the credit of a significant witness.

On a different note, it will be important for magistrates to bear in mind the importance of establishing the conditions for a fair trial. It may be that in a given case `the interests of justice' require that cross-examination of certain witnesses be allowed to avoid the defendant being taken by surprise at trial.

While it is possible to give some examples, it is not possible to be exhaustive. Certainly, it is not intended by giving these examples to limit the interpretation which magistrates may give the phrase `substantial reasons... In the interests of justice'. The process of judicial interpretation will allow the meaning of the phrase to be developed appropriately as need arises in a way which simply cannot be comprehensively expressed in a piece of legislation..." 
In a recent unreported decision in Losurdo versus Director of Public Prosecutions (10 March 1998), Hidden J, in recognising the distinction between the adjectives employed in [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s48.html), said: "Accordingly, `substantial' does not mean `special', and to establish substantial reasons for the attendance of witnesses at committal proceedings it is not necessary to show that the case is exceptional or unusual. It may be that substantial reasons could be shown in a majority of cases. Nor is it necessary to show that the cross examination might lead to the discharge of the defendant under [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s41.html) and [s (6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/s41.html) of the <case>;
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ja119/). In Barton versus The
Queen [(1980) 147 CLR 75], Gibbs ACJ and Mason J (at 99-101) and Stephen J (at -5) recognised that the opportunity to cross examine Crown witnesses was a legitimate benefit of committal proceedings to a defendant, quite apart from the opportunity of discharge by the magistrate. Stephen J spoke of `the opportunity of gaining relatively precise knowledge of the case against [the defendant] and, as well, of hearing the Crown witnesses give evidence on oath and of testing that evidence by cross examination.' 
His Honour considered that the loss of such an opportunity was `likely to be the most serious detriment which absence of prior committal proceedings imposes upon the accused.' See also The Queen versus Harry; ex parte Eastway (1985) SASR 203, per King CJ at 208-9; S versus Metanomski [(1993) 65 A Crim R ] at 355-6 (again per King CJ).

The modern procedure of service upon the defendant of the statements of prosecution witnesses has not, in my view, diminished the force of Stephen J's remarks. Nothing in the second reading speech of the Attorney General in the
Legislative Council in relation to the amendment bill which introduced <case> in its present form suggests that the legislative intention was to deprive a defendant of the opportunity to cross examine Crown witnesses unless it might lead to his or her discharge: NSW Parliamentary Debates, 26 September 1996, at pp 4671-2. What is clear is that the legislation was intended to avoid delays in the criminal justice process by unnecessary or prolix cross examination of witnesses at committal. The effect of the new provision is the defendant does not have an unfettered right to cross examine Crown witnesses, but must show that there are reasons of substance for doing so." 
In Losurdo his Honour considered that the magistrate had applied the wrong test and held that there had been a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction. Hence the matter was remitted to the magistrate. However, in the course of his judgment his Honour said that it may be appropriate to allow cross-examination at committal with an eye to the exercise of a discretion to exclude evidence at a subsequent trial, even though the magistrate had no such discretion at the committal hearing.

I observe that Losurdo was decided after the decision here under challenge so that in the present cases the learned magistrate did not have the benefit of reading what has been written by Hidden J.

Each plaintiff has submitted that the learned magistrate has failed to give reasons for refusing to give the directions sought other than in relation to
Dr Iyengar. Mr O'Donnell, for the defendant Director, has submitted to the contrary, arguing that a reading of the decision delivered on 6 March 1998 in its entirety reveals the reasons which led to the refusal of the directions requested. Those competing submissions demand close attention to the decision here challenged.

In his decision, the magistrate identified the application the plaintiffs were making and he recorded a number of grounds advanced by counsel upon which it was contended it would be legitimate to require cross-examination of witnesses. In recording such grounds I observe that they are not recorded as relating to any particular witness or witnesses, but rather in an aggregate way. The magistrate then made reference to authority, including Goldsmith v
Newman [(1992) 59 SASR 404] in which "special reasons" (in the context of a comparable South Australian provision) was considered by the Full Court. His
Worship expressly recognised in the course of his decision that the scope of "substantial reasons" was wider than the category of "special reasons" and he referred to the Second Reading Speech and to part of that extract from it which I set out earlier. The learned magistrate went on to refer to B v
Gould (supra) and in the context of referring to that case, and the earlier s
EA, said: "Whilst necessitating careful consideration the interests of the defendant cannot be limited to a consideration of his interests alone. A defendant who wishes to cross-examine an alleged victim on committal must satisfy the magistrate to whom the application is made that there are special reasons for this course to be adopted. Of course, this was the old usual sexual assault type application. The reasons must be special to the particular case. There must be some features of the particular case by reason of which it is out of the ordinary and by reason of which it is in the interests of justice that the alleged victim should be called to give oral evidence. It cannot be enough that the defendant would be prejudiced if the alleged victim is not called.
Plainly, there would be prejudice to the defendant in every case where the offence is denied and where the defendant does not have the opportunity of cross-examining the alleged victim at committal." 
His Worship then proceeded directly to determine the outcome of the applications before him, saying: "As a consequence, in relation to the exercise of that discretion, in relation to the witness Rhamgopal Ainga [sic] I propose to make the direction that that person attend. In relation to the other witnesses the defence has not availed upon me that so far as they are concerned there are substantial reasons why in the interests of justice they should attend to give oral evidence and so far as the applications relate to those witnesses I decline the application." 
It seems to me that a consideration of the various applications made under s
E warranted discrete consideration of the content of each statement sought to be introduced by the prosecution. This is because the evidence to be found in the statements addressed different issues and prompted different reasons for the requirements advanced for cross-examination. It was not intended to pursue the same issues with each of the witnesses whose attendance on committal was sought. The reasons for the application concerning Dr Iyengar were plain and the learned magistrate acceded to that application, but there were other considerations that applied to other categories of witnesses.

Mr Re, who appeared for Dr Mileshkin, submitted for instance that the intended objective in cross-examining one of the investigators, Mr Dargin, was the subject matter of his methodology. Mr Re wanted to cross-examine Mr Condie, an employee of the medical centre, concerning the procedures in place at the time of the commission of the alleged offences. Then there were four witnesses whose statements address matters of expert medical opinion and Mr Re sought the opportunity to cross-examine those experts as to the foundations and the reliability of their medical opinions and also as to appropriate medical practice in the early 1990s, at the time relevant to the commission of the alleged offences.

Mr Lawler indicated that there were different reasons behind the applications for the cross-examination of those witnesses whom he sought to cross-examine.
I do not propose to record exhaustively the reasons relating to each witness, but, by way of illustration, statements were served from Professor Berend and in those statements Professor Berend stated what the normal practices were at
Royal North Shore Hospital in relation to circumstances in which particular
Medicare claims were made. He stated his understanding of when claims could be made. Mr Lawler indicated that he wanted to cross-examine the professor about those matters. Mr Lawler also wanted to cross-examine witnesses to elicit information as to relevant ministerial guidelines, and to determine how those guidelines were communicated to medical practitioners. Those matters were issues of relevance to the element of dishonesty.

I have not exhaustively recorded the reasons advanced by counsel for all the applications made by the plaintiffs under <case>. On the contrary, I have referred to some objectives simply to emphasise the need for discrete consideration of what is behind the application to cross-examine each witness.
Unless such discrete consideration is given, the task under <case> cannot be properly addressed.

With respect to the learned magistrate, it does not appear that he has addressed his task in this way. The structure of the decision as recorded does not convey that he has done so. I have therefore reached the conclusion that there has been a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction in terms of those principles recorded by Priestley JA in Saffron and to which I referred earlier. In my opinion therefore each plaintiff is entitled to succeed on his summons.

I have not been asked by counsel to determine whether there are substantial reasons for requiring the attendance at committal of any one of those persons whose statements have been served upon the plaintiffs and it would not be appropriate for me to do so in any event. What I am asked to do is to order that the learned magistrate reconsider his decision of 6 March 1998 and for the reasons indicated, I propose to do so.

It may be useful for me to make the following additional observations in the context of the present applications, although I emphasise that I am not intending what I am about to state to be treated as an attempt to state all factors that may be relevant to these applications or other applications under s 48E:
Section 48E(2)(b) plainly has as a primary aim the limitation of the time occupied in committal proceedings. Such proceedings are not to provide the opportunity for a full dress rehearsal for the trial. Cross-examination is to be eliminated unless it is required in the interests of justice for reasons that are reasons of substance.
There can be no rigid or exhaustive definition of what constitutes "substantial reasons" and it would be undesirable to attempt to give one.
Relevant issues inevitably vary from case to case. However, any statement served has to be considered with reference to the issues it addresses and the charge to which it relates. The application to cross-examine requires identification and consideration of the objective of the cross-examiner, and the framework of the prosecution case. To require a witness for cross- examination without a definite aim but in the hope of eliciting some evidence that might prove useful to the defence would not constitute "substantial reasons". It is for the applicant to clearly define the purpose or purposes of the cross-examination which he seeks.
It would be wrong to limit "substantial reasons" to situations where cross-examination is likely to result in the discharge of the defendant or to establish grounds for a no bill application. Equally it would be wrong to limit "substantial reasons" to situations where cross-examination is likely to substantially undermine the credit of an important witness. "Substantial reasons" may well be found elsewhere.
On any application under <case> the fundamental objective of committal proceedings must be borne in mind, namely the objective of facilitating a fair trial in the event that the person charged is committed and later stands trial. This may mean that there are substantial reasons for requiring a witness for cross-examination for a proper understanding of the nature of the prosecution case or for an understanding of the basis of a relevant opinion held by a witness. I do but give those instances, I certainly do not intend them to be exhaustive.
"Substantial reason" may be shown for cross-examination where this may lead to the narrowing of matters in dispute: see Goldsmith versus Newman (supra) at 411. This is a consideration of particular importance where the prospect exists of a lengthy trial, as it does in the present cases.
