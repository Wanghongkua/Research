TERRENCE JAMES HAMILL versus BYRON SHIRE COUNCIL & ANOR 
CA 40242/98 October 1998 
Mason P, Powell JA, Beazley JA 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Appeal 
JUDGMENT 
MASON P: The Court has decided to dismiss the appeal. I will read our short reasons for decision and then hand down the document. 
The appeal is dismissed with costs and the Court was of the unanimous opinion that the appeal does not raise any question of general principle. Pursuant to s 45(4) of The [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/) the Court's reasons for decision in shortform are: 
The appeal reagitates the issues dealt with by Bignold J.

The Court sees no error in his Honour's reasons.

None of the specific documents to which the Court was taken in argument are documents which the Council was required to take into account when considering the development application under challenge.

The complaint that Bignold J ignored certain submissions put to him lacks foundation.

A judge does not have to address each and every document put before him, especially where they bear no relevance to the issues.

I will hand down copies of those short reasons and a signed copy will go in the Court's records.
