THURSDAY, 2 NOVEMBER 2006  /2006 HEALEY versus COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION (No. 2)  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: On 22 August 2006, the Court as presently constituted determined an appeal by Gregory Harrison Healey against a judgment of a
Magistrate, His Honour Lulham LCM, given on 17 May 2006. The judgment of 22
August 2006 (Healey versus Commissioner of Taxation <case> granted the appeal, quashed the orders made and remitted the original application to the Local Court to be dealt with in accordance with law. I reserved to the parties any application they wish to make on the question of costs. This judgment deals with costs.  The plaintiff, by written submissions, sought costs of and incidental to the proceedings in this Court subsequent to the handing down of the August judgment.  I do not intend to summarise the August judgment. It is sufficient for my purposes to note that the appeal was successful on grounds not directly raised by the plaintiff, being that the Magistrate excluded from his exercise of discretion a relevant matter and thereby erred in law and vitiated the discretion exercised.  The defendant opposes the award of costs and does so on the basis of the discretion of the Court and also on the basis of the jurisdiction of the
Court. The jurisdictional argument relies upon the judgment of the High Court in Solomons versus District Court of New South Wales <case>; [(2002) 211 CLR 119.] That judgment, confirming a judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court, determined that the provisions of the [Judiciary Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cwth) do not render applicable the [Costs in Criminal Cases Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/) to a trial and acquittal in a New South Wales state court on an indictment charging offences under law of the Commonwealth.  The prosecution of the plaintiff in the Local Court by the defendant, which prosecution was continuing at the time of the appeal, was, of course, not a trial on indictment and, as yet, there has been no acquittal or otherwise. The costs that are being sought are the costs of the appeal under the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001.  There are a number of distinguishing features between the entitlement to costs on such an appeal and the right of a trial judge to order costs on trial and acquittal. Apart from the more subtle distinctions, costs of an appeal of this kind are dealt with, at least in part, by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s98.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) (previously <case> of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/)) and by s of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001; they are not dealt with by the [Costs in Criminal Cases Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cicca1967226/).  Interesting as the jurisdictional issue is, it is unnecessary for me to determine it. As the defendant in this proceeding points out, and as is stated above, the appeal succeeded on a point that was not raised in the court below or on appeal in this Court. The learned Magistrate allowed an amendment by the
Commissioner of a highly technical nature. The Commissioner had inadvertently misspelt the name of the defendant. The Magistrate did so under the provisions of [s
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/s15c.html) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/) (Cwth). The plaintiff argued in the appeal proceedings that [s
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/s15c.html) was inapplicable. I rejected that argument. However, as earlier indicated, I took the view that the Magistrate was too narrow in determining the matters that could be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion reposed in the
Local Court.  In remitting the matter back to the Local Court, I made it clear that the
Magistrate was able to take into account certain matters and, once he did, may come to the same view as originally taken. These are matters of discretion in areas of practice and procedure.  Given the nature of the matter and the fact that the plaintiff succeeded on a ground not argued in the court below or on appeal, it is within the discretion of this Court that any order for costs would not necessarily follow the event: Whitehouse Properties Pty Ltd versus Bond Brewing Ltd [(1992) NSWLR 17] at 24; Wickstead versus Browne [(1992) 30 NSWLR 1] at 19.  In the exercise of the discretion of the Court, I order that each party pay its or his own costs of and incidental to the proceedings, including the costs associated with this dispute on costs. Otherwise, the proceedings are dismissed.
