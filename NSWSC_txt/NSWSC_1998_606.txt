Samuel LIPARI & Anor v UNION des ASSURANCES de PARIS I.A.R.D.

Trevor John Stevens (the first respondent in the proceedings below) brought a claim in the Local Court claiming compensation for damage caused to his motor vehicle while it was at the appellants' premises for repair. The appellants joined the insurer (the respondent in the present proceedings) seeking indemnity under their general policy of insurance. Mr Stevens succeeded against the appellants, however, the appellants failed on their third party claim against the insurer.

The magistrate found the appellants had not serviced the hoist, which caused the damage to the vehicle, for 6 years before the accident and were negligent in its maintenance. Condition 3 of the insurance policy stated that the policy was voidable if the insured failed to take all reasonable precautions to prevent loss or damage to property. The magistrate considered that the negligence of the appellants amounted to a breach of that condition. After considering the condition in conjunction with [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) of the [Insurance Contracts Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/) (the
Act) he concluded that the insurer was entitled to escape liability.

The matter came before Studdert J by way of a stated case. His Honour, held that the magistrate had not erred in law and, notwithstanding that the policy had not been avoided, the insurer could rely on [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) of the Act and refuse to pay the claim.

On appeal: 
The appellants submit that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) of the Act does not operate in these circumstances. The insurance policy conferred a right to avoid the contract for breach of a condition, but not a right to refuse to pay the claim. No election to avoid had been made by the insurer.

Held: 
The effect of the contract was to give to the insurer a right to avoid the policy if it elected to do so. It did not impose an obligation on the insured which, if not met, gave the insurer a right to refuse to pay the claim. A contract of insurance should be read according to its terms and not have other terms substituted by the court. In the absence of an election to avoid the policy, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) of the Act does not arise for consideration. This was the case notwithstanding that the insurer was prevented from voiding the policy because of the Act.

Samuel LIPARI & Anor v

UNION des ASSURANCES de PARIS I.A.R.D.

JUDGMENT 
SHELLER JA: I agree with Stein JA. 
MEAGHER JA: I agree with Stein JA. 
STEIN JA: This appeal concerns the application of [s 54](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) of the [Insurance Contracts Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/) (Cth) (the Act) to a general condition of a policy of insurance issued by the respondent insurer. 
It comes to the court by way of a stated case from a decision of a magistrate to Studdert J. Before the Local Court the plaintiff, Trevor John Stevens, claimed compensation for damage caused to his motor vehicle while it was left with the defendants for repair. The defendants are the appellants before the court. The vehicle was damaged when a hoist collapsed while laden with another vehicle which struck the plaintiff's vehicle. The appellants joined their insurer, the present respondent, seeking indemnity under their policy of general insurance.

The plaintiff succeeded against the appellants in negligence. The appellants, however, failed in their third party claim. This failure prompted the stated case. The magistrate had found that the appellants had not serviced the hoist for 6 years before the accident and were negligent in its maintenance. One of the general conditions of the policy provided:
Prevention of Loss 
This policy shall be voidable if you fail to take all reasonable precautions to prevent loss or damage to property or injury to persons and to employ competent and trustworthy employees and to comply with all Statutory obligations by-laws and regulations imposed by any Public Authority and to remedy and/or repair any defects in the ways works machinery and plant connected with or used in the business.

The insurer contended that the negligence of the appellants amounted to a breach of the obligation imposed by the condition. The magistrate considered that the condition had to be examined in conjunction with [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) of the Act. He concluded that when this was done, the insurer was entitled to escape liability. The appellants contended that this was an error of law by the magistrate and asked him to state a case for the Supreme Court.

Studdert J found that the determination of the magistrate was not erroneous in point of law. His Honour said: 
It seems to me in the present case that the impact of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) on the policy condition required that the court consider it as a term imposing on the appellants an obligation to comply with it and to treat a failure to discharge such obligation as a breach of such term. [AB 49] 
His Honour held that notwithstanding that the policy had not been avoided, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) entitled the insurer to refuse the claim. Studdert J noted that the insurer could not avoid the policy because of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s55.html) and other provisions of the Act. However, it had filed a defence pleading condition 3 and relied on it as a defence at the hearing. Notwithstanding the non avoidance of the contract of insurance the insurer could rely on [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) and refuse to pay the claim.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) of the Act provides: 
Subject to this section, where the effect of a contract of insurance would, but for this section, be that the insurer may refuse to pay a claim, either in whole or in part, by reason of some act of the insured or of some other person, being an act that occurred after the contract was entered into but not being an act in respect of which subsection (2) applies, the insurer may not refuse to pay the claim by reason only of that act but his liability in respect of the claim is reduced by the amount that fairly represents the extent to which the insurer's interests were prejudiced as a result of that act.

Subject to the succeeding provisions of this section, where the act could reasonably be regarded as being capable of causing or contributing to a loss in respect of which insurance cover is provided by the contract, the insurer may refuse to pay the claim.

Where the insured proves that no part of the loss that gave rise to the claim was caused by the act, the insurer may not refuse to pay the claim by reason only of the act.

Where the insured proves that some part of the loss that gave rise to the claim was not caused by the act, the insurer may not refuse to pay the claim, so far as it concerns that part of the loss, by reason only of the act.

Where: the act was necessary to protect the safety of a person or to preserve property; or it was not reasonably possible for the insured or other person not to do the act; the insurer may not refuse to pay the claim by reason only of the act.

A reference in this section to an act includes a reference to: an omission; and an act or omission that has the effect of altering the state or condition of the subject-matter of the contract or of allowing the state or condition of that subject-matter to alter.

It is the submission of Mr Coles, Senior Counsel for the appellants, that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) does not operate in the present circumstances. The contract conferred a right to avoid, not to refuse to pay a claim, see Newbon versus City Mutual Life
Assurance Society Ltd <case>; <case>; [(1950) 81 CLR 418] at 441.5. No election to avoid had been made by the insurer.
Mr Coles submits that the section modifies existing contractual rights but does not create a new right in the insurer that it would not have under the contract, that is to refuse to pay the claim.

The plain fact is that the insurer took no step to avoid the policy. The magistrate so found. The policy remained afoot. That the insurer was prevented by the Act from voiding the policy does not advance the insurer's position under the condition. The insurer's own policy wording lead it to seek to invoke [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) in order to permit a right to refuse to pay the claim.

In considering the application of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html), it is important to determine the effect of the contract of insurance. Is it that the insurer may refuse to pay the claim by reason of something the appellants did, or omitted to do, after the policy came into existence? 
In this case, it is submitted that the right arose by reason of the failure to service the hoist. However, it seems to me that the effect of the contract (condition 3) was to give to the insurer the right to avoid the policy if it elected so to do. If the insurer does not elect to avoid the policy, it is difficult to see how it can be said that the effect of the contract is as described in [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) 
When one examines condition 3, it may readily be observed that it contains no promise or obligation on the part of the insured. It did not, in its terms, oblige the insured to maintain the hoist. Rather, the condition describes a possible consequence for the insured if the insured fails to comply with his or her statutory obligations or other requirements specified in the condition.
The consequence is, that the insurer may elect to avoid the policy. In the absence of the exercise of an election by the insurer, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) of the Act does not arise for consideration. It is simply not engaged.

As a general proposition, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) is directed to ameliorating the position of insureds. It is likely that it was not envisaged that the provision could be invoked for the benefit of insurers.
Counsels' researches have found no case where it has been invoked to assist an insurer where the contractual language was found to be deficient.

In my opinion, the only way that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) can be engaged is if the appellants have breached a condition of the policy which entitled the insurer to refuse to pay the claim. However, general condition 3 does not impose a contractual obligation on the insured to maintain the equipment. Thus, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) is not enlivened.

Counsel for the respondent insurer argues that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) should be approached, not as a matter of form but as a matter of substance. By virtue of the Act, the insurer was not at liberty to avoid the policy. Thus, looking at the situation from a practical point of view, the insurer ought be given the opportunity to rely upon the failure of the insured to fulfill their obligations to comply with statutory requirements. Mr O'Dowd submits that the condition imposes an indirect but positive obligation on the insured.

I reject the submission. Condition 3 imposes no obligation on the insured.
Further, there is no occasion to read one into the provision. One way of testing the respondent's submission is to ask what the situation would be if the insurer decided not to avoid the policy knowing of the failure to comply.
It may have reasons to prefer to keep the policy afoot. However, could it decline to pay a claim because of the breach of the inferred obligation? Mr
O'Dowd accepts that ordinary principles would not permit this to occur. If that be the case, it is difficult to see any room for the operation of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) to the circumstances.

In short, the respondent would have the court re-write general Condition 3 to transform it into a positive obligation upon the insured and one upon which [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) can operate. This cannot be correct. A contract of insurance should be read according to its terms and not have other terms substituted by the court,
McCormack versus Hardboards Australia Ltd & Anor; W. D. Peacock &
Associates Pty Ltd (third party) & Ors [(1984) 3 ANZ Insurance Cases, -563.] The clause gives to the insurer the right to elect to avoid the policy in certain circumstances. It does not impose an obligation upon the insured which, if not met, accrues a right in the insurer to refuse to pay a claim. I do not see how such a construction as advanced by the insurer can be said to be the effect of the contract of insurance. I am unable to accept that there is subsumed in the notion of avoiding the contract, the right to refuse to pay a claim.

In my opinion, it cannot be concluded that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ica1984220/s54.html) was enacted to provide an insurer with an alternative right to refuse a claim when the contract of insurance had chosen to provide a right to elect to avoid (subject to the Act) in order to alleviate the difficulties of avoidance confronting the insurer because of the legislation.

It follows that I find that the magistrate's determination was erroneous in point of law.

In my opinion, the appeal should be allowed and the orders made by Studdert J set aside. The question posed in paragraph 5 of the stated case, namely:
The matter to be determined by the Court is whether my determination was erroneous in point of law.
 should be answered in the affirmative and the matter remitted to the Local
Court to be dealt with accordingly. The respondent should pay the appellants' costs of the appeal and have a certificate under the Suitors' Fund Act if otherwise entitled. The respondent should pay the costs of the proceedings before Studdert J.
