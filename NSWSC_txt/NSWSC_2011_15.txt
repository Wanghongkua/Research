Judgment 
The state of these proceedings | The remaining matters in issue concern MBL seeking pre-judgment interest on the damages awarded in its favour.  ---|---  | Both parties have reduced their submissions to writing.  | In my view the plaintiffs submissions of substance and they are adopted in what follows.  | The recognised purpose of an award of interest is to ensure a plaintiff is properly compensated for the practical loss it has suffered. Thus, an award is usually made.  
Power to award interest | Meinhardt has indicated that it proposes to oppose an award of interest on the basis that this Court has no power to award interest on damages where the damages are awarded under [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s82.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) .  ---|---  | MBL disputes Meinhardt's position, and contends that the Court has power to award damages.  | The correct finding is that [s.86](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s86.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) gives a
State Court power to award interest on an award of damages in proceedings for contravention of [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) where that
State Court has power under a law of the State to award interest on damages.
In New South Wales [s.100](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s100.html) of the [Civil Procedure
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) gives the
Supreme Court power to award interest on damages.  [Section 86](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s86.html) of the [Trade Practices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) | [Section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s86.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) confers on this Court jurisdiction with respect to a matter arising under Division 1 [Part
V](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p5) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) . This is such a case.  ---|---  | [Section (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s86.html) makes it plain that the power invested in the Court in respect of such a matter extends to granting remedies that the court is able to grant under the law of the State.  | That sub-section, by confirming that it is not the intention of [s86(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s86.html) to confer on an inferior court of a State a power to grant remedies other than those of a kind the court is able to grant under the law of that State, confirms that [s86(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s86.html) does confer, on both superior and inferior courts of a State, the power to grant remedies of the kind they are able to grant under the law of the State.
This includes the power to award interest.  | In Truss versus Brazier [(1990) 96 ALR 767], Cooper J at 795 found that:  
The legislature, in enacting [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s86.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) , intended that State courts ought to exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal
Court of Australia and give such relief by way of remedy as was available in that court, provided the remedy was of a kind the State court could grant under State law" and that the section...
 "operates to empower a State court to grant discretionary interest on an award of damages under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s82.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) if the court has a power of that kind under State law. The amendment [i.e. the amendment to the TPA introducing [s.86]](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s86.html) provides an additional remedy and the power to grant the remedy is vested in a
State court while exercising federal jurisdiction under the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) .
 | Justice Shepherdson, with whom Kneipp J agreed, gave a judgment to like effect. Justice Shepherdson also identified s4 of the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act (Cth) as a separate head of power to award interest.  ---|---  | The decision in Truss versus Brazier has not been doubted or overturned.
Indeed it has been followed: Slattery versus Beare  <case>  | The decision in Truss versus Brazier makes perfect sense. It would be an absurd result if this Court was vested with power to hear and determine a claim for damages for breach of [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) , yet did not have power to award interest on those damages in the usual way. The legislators can never have intended such an absurd result. This is particularly so having regard to the establishment of the cross-vesting regime, under which cases involving claims for damages for breach of [s.52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) are regularly transferred from the Federal Court to the Supreme Court, and vice versa.  [Section 100](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s100.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) | There is no question that a law of the State of New South Wales has vested power in the Supreme Court to award interest on damages.  ---|---  | [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s100.html) of the [Civil Procedure
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) , by its express terms, confers power on this Court to include interest in the amount for which judgment is given "in proceedings for the recovery of money (including any debt or damages or the value of goods) ".  
Conclusion | It follows from the above that this Court has power to award pre- judgment interest on the damages award in this case.  ---|---  
The erroneous note in Ritchie's | There is a note in Ritchie's service at [s100.90] which states that interest cannot be awarded under [s.100](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s100.html) in relation to claims for damages under [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s82.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) .  ---|---  | The case cited in that note is Yolarno Pty Ltd versus Transglobal Capital
Pty Ltd (No. 4)  <case>, a decision of Gzell J.  | In Yolarno , Gzell J dealt briefly with the question of the Court's power to award interest under s.94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) (since repealed).  | His Honour there held that the case of Australian National Airlines
Commission versus The Commonwealth <case>; [(1975) 49 ALJR 338] was authority for the proposition that s.94 did not empower the court to award pre-judgment interest on s.82 damages award, and that he was constrained to follow it.  | Meinhardt's position is that this Court, in considering MBL's claim for interest under [s.100](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s100.html) of the [Civil Procedure
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) , should follow the approach adopted by Gzell J in Yolarno when his Honour considered s.94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) .  | In my view and with due respect to what may have been a different express by Gzell J in Yolarno in giving a short ex tempore judgment , that finding is one which I cannot accept.  | It is clear from a reading of Yolarno that the finding of Gzell J as to the operation of s.94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) was based on his Honour's understanding that Australian National Airlines had decided that the section did not confer power on the Supreme Court to award interest on a damages award made under the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) , and he was bound to follow it.  | A reading of Australian National Airlines demonstrates, however, that this case was not authority for that proposition.  | It is not clear from the ex tempore reasons in Yolarno whether, at the time of delivering his ex tempore judgment, Gzell J had before him and read the Australian National Airlines case, or whether instead his Honour was working off a (mistaken) note in a practice service. It is unlikely that his Honour did have the case before him at the time of his judgment.  | I accept that there is, in fact, no finding in Australian National
Airlines that s.94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) did not empower the Supreme Court of New South Wales to award interest on a damages award made by the Supreme Court.  | Australian National Airlines was not concerned with the construction and operation of s.94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) , or with the operation of that section in the Supreme Court. It was concerned with something altogether different.  | Australian National Airlines concerned whether [s.79](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s79.html) of the [Judiciary
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth) operated so as to enable the High Court to use s.94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) to make an award of interest in a case that was before the High Court exercising its original jurisdiction . Mason J (sitting alone) found that [s.79](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s79.html) of the [Judiciary
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) could not operate in that way.  | The plaintiff has helpfully summarised the essential findings in
Australian National Airlines by marking up the conclusions.  | The conclusion marked "1" was that the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) conferred power on the Supreme Court to order interest on damages in judgments entered by that court tin proceedings before it. This is not controversial.  | The conclusion marked "2" was that [s.79](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s79.html) of the [Judiciary
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) did not pick up and apply in the High Court a provision which empowered the Supreme
Court to make orders and enter judgments in proceedings in that court. This finding concerned the operation of [s.79](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s79.html) of the [Judiciary
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) . This issue does not arise here.  | The conclusion marked "3" was that even if [s.79](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s79.html) of the [Judiciary
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) could operate to pick up and apply s.94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) to proceedings before the High Court exercising its original jurisdiction, it would not assist the applicant in the particular case before the High Court because the proceeding in the High Court was commenced before s.94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) commenced operation. This issue does not arise here.  | The conclusion marked "4" was that even if [s.79](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s79.html) of the [Judiciary
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) could operate and pick up and apply s.94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) to proceedings before the High Court exercising its original jurisdiction, it would be inappropriate for the High Court to exercise that power when the High
Court had its own code of procedure prescribed by the statutes and rules of the High Court. This issue does not arise here.  | The conclusion marked "5" was that even if [s.79](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s79.html) of the [Judiciary
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) could operate and pick up and apply s.94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) to proceedings before the High Court exercising its original jurisdiction, the court on the particular facts of that case would not have exercised the discretionary power to award interest in circumstances where the damages claim was made by way of late amendment. This issue does not arise here.  | The conclusion marked "6" was concerned with the power of the High Court to make an award of interest against the Commonwealth , being the first of a number of defendants. This issue does not arise here.  | As is obvious from this recitation of the findings in Australian
National Airlines , they were concerned with issues which do not arise in this case, and none of the findings was that s.94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) did not confer power on the Supreme Court to award interest on a damages award made by it under [s.82](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s82.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) .  | That being so, Gzell J was in error in proceeding on the basis that
Australian National Airlines was authority for the proposition that s.94 of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) did not confer power on this Court to award interest on s.82 damages.  | Further and in any event, the decision of Gzell J is erroneous because:  
Australian National Airlines was decided prior to the introduction of s.86 into the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) in 1987; and 
Gzell J does not have appear to have been taken to, and thus gave no consideration to, the operation of [s.86](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s86.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) or the court of appeal decision in Truss versus Brazier .
 | As such, even if Australian National Airlines had decided what his
Honour thought it had decided, it was not binding on him having regard to the legislative changes that had been made in the intervening period, and the authorities concerning the effect of those changes.  ---|---  | For the above reasons in my view the basis upon which Gzell J proceeded in Yolarno was incorrect .  | That being so, Yolarno cannot be relied upon by the defendant for a finding that this Court does not have power to award interest on a damages award made under the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) .  
Rate of interest | The usual order made for interest is that based on the application of the rates of interest set out in Schedule 5 to the UCPR.  ---|---  | There is no reason to depart from that usual approach here.  | In the result interest is to be awarded for the period up to judgment.
The plaintiff is directed to update the calculations bearing in mind the time in which the parties and the court had taken to reach a result.  
Interest as damages | Even if the above analysis be incorrect, such that this court did not have power to award pre-judgment interest under [s.100](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s100.html) of the [Civil Procedure
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) , MBL seeks interest as damages.  ---|---  | Strictly speaking, this has not been separately particularised as a head of loss. However:  i. the Commercial List is not a court of strict pleadings; ii. it has always been plain from the Summons that MBL was claiming interest (albeit reference was only made to [s.100)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s100.html); iii. Meinhardt never notified MBL that it proposed to contend that the
Court did not have power to award interest under [s.100.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s100.html)
If it be incumbent upon MBL to claim interest under [s100](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s100.html) as it did (see Pheeney versus Doolan [[1977] 1 NSWLR 4)], it was incumbent upon Meinhardt to notify MBL that it proposed to take the lack of power point. It never did, thus failing to act appropriately by litigating with its cards on the table (see Baulderstone Hornibrook versus Gordian Runoff  <case> | In these circumstances had it been necessary I accept that it was open to MBL to seek interest as damages at this stage.  ---|---  * * *
