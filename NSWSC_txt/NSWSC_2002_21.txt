EQUITY DIVISION  
BARRETT J  
TUESDAY, 29 JANUARY 2001  /2001 - STATE BANK OF NEW SOUTH WALES versus TELA PTY LIMITED  
JUDGMENT   The plaintiff applies under [s.459P](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459p.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) 2001 for an order for the winding up of the defendant in insolvency on the basis of noncompliance with a statutory demand served on 14 November 2001.  A preliminary question has arisen as to whether the defendant should be allowed to cross-examine Mr Carroll, who is the deponent of the affidavit which, in accordance with [s.459E(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459e.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), accompanied the statutory demand. That affidavit includes, in conformity with
Form 7 as required by Corporations Law [Rule .2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s5.2.html), a statement of the deponent's belief that there is no genuine dispute about the existence or amount of the relevant debt. It is in that area that cross- examination is proposed.  Service of both the statutory demand and the accompanying affidavit of Mr
Carroll is to be proved by an affidavit of Mr Wooldridge. This is one of six affidavits that Mr Hollo, counsel for the plaintiff, has indicated he intends reading on the [s.459P](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459p.html) application. Mr Carroll's accompanying affidavit under [s.459E(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459e.html) is not one of the affidavits Mr Hollo intends reading. That being so, Mr Hollo says, there will be no occasion for Mr Carroll to be cross-examined.  There is thus a question whether the plaintiff may progress its winding up application without adducing as evidence, on the hearing of that application, the statements made by Mr Carroll in his [s.459E(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459e.html) affidavit.  In my judgment, the plaintiff is at liberty to present and progress its case in that way. The expression "must be accompanied" in [s.459E(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459e.html), referring to an affidavit, contemplates, in a temporal sense, the time at which the statutory demand is served. In other words, the affidavit to which [s.459E(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459e.html) refers is an affidavit which must be served with the statutory demand when that demand is itself served. It follows that if it is shown, as it will be by
Mr Wooldridge's affidavit, that Mr Carroll's affidavit was served with the statutory demand, and if, in addition, that affidavit, on its face, complies as to content and form with the requirements of [s.459E(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s459e.html) and the applicable [Corporations Law
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolreg/clr254/), then the composite step [Part .4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolreg/clr254/index.html#p5.4) contemplates as the starting point of the process founded on a statutory demand will be shown to have been taken. There is no requirement that, upon the hearing of the winding up application, the plaintiff adduce as evidence the content of the s.459E(3) affidavit.  The s.459P application for a winding up order founded on noncompliance with a statutory demand must itself be accompanied by an affidavit of debt. This is required by s.459Q(c). Mr Hollo has indicated that that requirement will be addressed by the plaintiff without resort to Mr Carroll's affidavit. The plaintiff will rely, for that purpose, on later affidavits sworn by another bank officer, Mr Stevens.  I have concluded that the plaintiff's decision not to read the affidavit of
Mr Carroll is in no way inimical to its present application which may proceed in the absence of that evidence. The question of cross-examination of Mr
Carroll therefore does not arise.
