James Hardie and Co P/L versus Warren John Berry and Ords [1997] NSWSC 63 (3
March 1997) 
JAMES HARDIE AND CO PTY LTD versus WARREN JOHN BERRY & ORS /97 
MONDAY 3 MARCH 1997 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COURT OF APPEAL 
MEAGHER JA, BROWNIE AJA 
JUDGMENT 
MEAGHER JA: In this matter the manufacturer, James Hardie & Co Pty Ltd, is seeking to appeal from an order of 
O'Meally J of the Dust Diseases Tribunal allowing certain interrogatories to be administered. His Honour obviously thought, and with reason, that the admissibility or otherwise of the interrogatories was a matter of considerable importance for the jurisdiction he was administering, and so it appears.

However, in my view leave should not be given in this Court unless the claimant can put forward a good case for the arguable incorrectness of the trial judge's finding.

In the present case in all the circumstances I do not think this has been done. I therefore am of the view that the summons should be dismissed with costs.

BROWNIE AJA: I agree with the orders proposed. I do not think this is a suitable vehicle for a test case. I should say one thing; if, as Mr Douglas suggests, the claimant cannot answer the interrogatories in the time allowed by the date of the trial, it would be within the trial judge's discretion as to whether the trial should be adjourned. If in truth the claimant doing its best cannot answer the interrogatories in time, then it may justify an adjournment. I do not know. I express no view about that.
