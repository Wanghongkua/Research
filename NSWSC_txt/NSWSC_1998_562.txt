JUDGMENT 
BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Fitzgerald AJA. 
STEIN JA: I agree with Fitzgerald AJA. 
FITZGERALD AJA: This appeal arises out of a dispute between solicitors and a costs assessor, which was preceded by a dispute between the solicitors and a client concerning costs which the solicitors sought to recover from the client. 
On 23 August 1996, the client filed an application objecting to a bill of costs given to it by the solicitors, which, according to the application, was constituted by letters dated 27 March and 2 May 1996 from the solicitors to the client. The application sought to have the matter referred to a costs assessor. The solicitors' reply to the client's application was filed on 18
September 1996. On 24 September 1996, the proper officer of the Supreme Court referred the matter to a costs assessor.

In the course of an exchange of contentious correspondence, the costs assessor notified the solicitors on 29 October 1996 that he insisted on "...a bill containing items (numbered sequentially) which set out fully the particulars referred to Regulation 22A...".[1] The solicitors were informed that the costs assessor would not assess the costs "... until you have complied with my request to provide bills in proper assessable form".

On 31 October 1996, the solicitors filed a summons naming the costs assessor as defendant. The client did not wish to become involved in the litigation, and the Attorney-General was granted leave to intervene, and, apparently, represented the costs assessor. After a hearing which extended over a number of days, a Judge of the Equity Division declared: "1. That upon its proper construction, [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/index.html#p11) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) does not entitle the [costs assessor] to require the [solicitors] to put in proper form their bill of costs the subject of the application of [the client] ..." 
A further declaration was made by consent that the costs assessor was entitled pursuant to [s207](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s207.html) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) to require the solicitors by notice in writing to provide in relation to their costs the subject of the application "... the following further particulars in generally chronological order and numbered sequentially: "(ii) short details of each item of work, whether by letter, telephone attendance, perusal, drafting conference and so on done on behalf of Howship
Holdings Pty Limited for it: the date each item of work was done; the time (in minutes) engaged in doing each item of work; of who precisely did each item of work; the amount charged for doing each item of work; and the basis for calculating the amounts charged for doing the work." 
The Attorney General appealed to this Court by leave against the first declaration made by the primary judge. Neither the client, the solicitors nor the costs assessor participated in the appeal. On the advice of the Attorney-
General, the Crown Solicitor appointed counsel to appear as Amicus Curiae to assist the Court. There is no suggestion that the particulars required by the consent declaration will not conveniently provide the costs assessor with all information necessary for the assessment of the bill.

While the first declaration made by the primary judge did not define what was meant by a bill of costs "in proper form", the submissions made to this Court on behalf of the Attorney General were to the effect that, on an assessment of costs payable by a client to a solicitor, a costs assessor may not only insist upon a bill of costs particularised in accordance with regulation 22A of the
Legal Profession Regulation and further particulars pursuant to s207 of the
Legal Profession Act 1898 , but may also require the solicitor to formulate a bill of costs in accordance with the practice previously adopted in preparing bills of costs for taxation under the Legal Practitioners Act and the Legal Profession Act prior to its amendment in 1993.

It is convenient to leave out of consideration any additional factors introduced by a costs agreement between solicitor and client.[2] The term "costs" is defined in subsection 3(1) of the Legal Profession Act, and "bill of costs" and "costs agreement" are defined in subsection 173(1) of that Act.
"Bills of costs" are one of the matters dealt with in Part 11 Division 4. A solicitor may not commence or maintain proceedings for the recovery of costs for legal services unless at least 30 days have passed since a bill for those costs was given to the client in "accordance with" Division 4.[3] Subsection (1) of the of the Legal Profession Act permits regulations which make provision "for or with respect to the form of, and the particulars to be included in, bills of costs". It was common ground before this Court that regulation 22A, which is to be found in Part 7 Division 1 the Legal Profession
Regulation 1994, is a regulation made in accordance with subsection 193(1).

Division 6 of Part 11 of the Legal Profession Act concerns the "Assessment of costs". Provision is made for the client who is given a bill of costs to apply to the proper officer of the Supreme Court for an assessment of the whole or any part of those costs, even if the costs have been wholly or partly paid.[4] A client may also apply for an assessment although costs have been paid without a bill of costs.[5] Subsection 203 of the Act provides how an application is to be made, and s204 identifies the persons who must be notified of the application.

The proper officer of the Supreme Court is required " ... to refer each application for assessment to a costs assessor to be dealt with under this
Division".[6] Provision is made in s208 and subdivision 2 of Division 6 of
Part 11, "Assessments of bills of costs", concerning the course to be followed by a costs assessor. A number of matters must be considered by a costs assessor when considering an application relating to a bill of costs,[7] and other matters may be considered.[8] Separate provisions are made with respect to the assessment of costs that are the subject of a costs agreement and with respect to the assessment of party and party costs.

Provision is made for the enforcement of assessments and appeals by Part 11
Division 6 Subdivision 4. It is unnecessary to refer to those matters or to the "Miscellaneous" matters which are the subject of Part 11 Division 6
Subdivision 5 other than subsection 208S(4), which states that a costs assessor is not an officer of the Court when acting as a costs assessor.

The only other provision to which it is necessary to make reference is s207, which provides: 
Costs assessors may require documents or further particulars 
A costs assessor may, notice in writing, require a person (including the applicant, the barrister or solicitor concerned, or any other barrister, solicitor or client) to produce any relevant documents of or held by the person in respect of the matter.

The costs assessor may, by any such notice, require further particulars to be furnished by the applicant, barrister, solicitor, client or other person as to instructions given to, or work done by the barrister or solicitor or nay other legal practitioner in respect of the matter and as to the basis on which costs were ascertained.

The costs assessor may require any such particulars to be verified by statutory declaration.

A notice under this section is to specify the period within which the notice is to be compleid with.

If a person fails, without reasonable excuse, to comply with a notice under this section, the costs assessor may decline to deal with the application or may continue to deal with the application on the basis of the information provided.

A barrister or solicitor who fails, without reasonable excuse to comply with a notice under this section is guilty of professional misconduct." 
The foundation of the Attorney-General's argument that a costs assessor may require a solicitor to formulate a bill of costs for assessment in accordance with the practice previously adopted in preparing bills of costs for taxation was that such a power is inherent or implied in a costs assessor's powers.

The difference between inherent and implied jurisdictions and powers has been explained in numerous cases.[9] It is unnecessary on this occasion to again discuss what has been authoritatively decided. The Attorney-General's submission is necessarily based on the premise that the functions and powers of a costs assessor under the Legal Profession Act are such that the power to impose a requirement that a bill be prepared in accordance with the practice previously adopted in preparing bills for taxation is necessary for the effective performance of a costs assessor's functions and exercise of a cost assessor's powers and hence is implicit in the material provisions of the
Legal Profession Act.

In my opinion, such a proposition is unsustainable because it is inconsistent with the new legislative scheme to be found in Part 11 of the Legal Profession
Act and the Legal Profession Regulation. It does not necessarily follow that a costs assessor may never direct the form in which a bill of costs is to be prepared consistently with Regulation 22A and s207. However, the possibility that such a bill might be essential for the effective performance of a costs assessment should be left for consideration in a subsequent case in which that is contended.

Declaration 1 should be set aside. It is both uncertain in meaning and capable of an operation that is too wide. No other declaration is needed for the purpose of the present case, or would serve a useful purpose in relation to other disputes which might arise concerning what a costs assessor may require.
Presumably, any such disputes will be decided in accordance with the principles deducible from the judgment of this Court.

In summary, the appeal should be allowed only to the extent that the first declaration should be set aside. There should be no order as to costs.
