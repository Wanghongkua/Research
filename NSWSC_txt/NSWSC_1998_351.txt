MACARY MANUFACTURING PTY LIMITED versus CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF LAND TAX /96 March 1998 
Black AJ 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Administrative Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: By summons dated 16 December 1996, the plaintiff company claims an order that the defendant's decisions of 26 June 1996 disallowing the plaintiff's objections to land tax assessments for the years 1988-1996 issued on 19 February 1996 be set aside; order that the plaintiff's said objections be allowed in full; and an order that the said land tax assessments be reduced to nil or be withdrawn. 
The facts giving rise to the dispute herein are contained in the undisputed affidavit of James Martin McCann sworn 19 May 1997, the annexures thereto and the exhibits thereto marked A consisting of documents JMM-1 to JMM-16 inclusive. Mr. McCann was not required for cross-examination and accordingly in the absence of any evidence filed on behalf of the defendant, I accept his evidence as to facts contained in his affidavit.

He and his wife, Wilna Helen McCann, are directors of the plaintiff company and they have three children. The company was incorporated on 14 July 1971.
JMM-1 is a copy of the company's Memorandum and Articles of Association, the only relevance of which is that by clause 2(c) the Third Schedule of the [Companies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/) was incorporated, clause 25 of which enabled the company to act as a trustee.

Document JMM-2 is the deed of settlement establishing the McCann No. 2 Family
Trust on 2 July 1977 by which the company was appointed trustee of the Trust.
By the Schedule, the specified beneficiaries are James Martin McCann, Wilna
McCann, the children of James Martin McCann and the children of Wilna McCann.
The distribution date was 30 June 2060 and no guardian was appointed.

Mr. McCann goes on to describe how the company acting as trustee for the
Trust, purchased the three lots of land, the subject of the disputed assessments, between 1977 and 1983 and thereafter held the land subject to the events of July 1986 and December 1987 as trustee for the Trust.

In paragraph (17) of his affidavit, he makes various statements about the use and occupation of the land. They are not disputed.

Annexure B to Mr. McCann's affidavit is a document described as Minutes of
Meeting of Directors of the plaintiff company acting in its capacity as trustee of the Trust on 25 July 1986. Paragraph (2) of that document reads as follows:- "IT WAS RESOLVED that the whole of the Trust Fund of the Trust (including but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the properties known as 27A
Harriette Street, Neutral Bay and 10 Penshurst Avenue, Neutral Bay) be set aside for, and appointed absolutely in favour of, James Martin McCann and
Wilna McCann in equal shares as joint tenants, upon the Vesting Day but upon the basis that the said James Martin McCann and Wilna McCann will discharge all liabilities whatsoever of the Trust as at the Vesting Day." 
That is signed by Mr. McCann and his wife.

Annexure C to Mr. McCann's affidavit is entitled Minutes of Meeting of
Directors of the plaintiff company acting in its capacity as Trustee of the
McCann No. 2 Family Trust held on 22 December 1987. Paragraph (2) of that document, so far as relevant, notes the appointment in July 1986 of the Trust
Fund to Mr. and Mrs. McCann in accordance with Annexure B and continues:- "IT WAS RESOLVED that today, Tuesday 22nd December 1987 be nominated as the
Vesting Day and, that to the extent that the Trust Fund remains unappointed, pursuant to the abovementioned resolution, that the whole of the capital and income of the Trust Fund be set aside for, and appointed absolutely in favour of James Martin McCann and Wilna McCann, in equal shares as joint tenants." 
That document is signed by Mr. and Mrs. McCann.

It should be noted that there is no suggestion, let alone any evidence, to suggest that those documents are other than truthful and accurate accounts of the events recorded therein.

The issue arising from the above facts can be stated as follows. Was the plaintiff company the owner of the land in question at the date relevant to these assessments, namely midnight on 31 December 1987 and thereafter? It is contended on behalf of the plaintiff that it was not the owner at the material time within the definition of that term in [s.3(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/s3.html) of the [Land Tax Management Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/). The defendant maintains that the plaintiff was the owner within the meaning of that definition.

It is convenient to record at this stage that I heard the substantive argument on this summons on 9 March 1998. The following day counsel on behalf of the defendant notified me that he had misunderstood his instructions on one issue and wished to address further submissions to me. Counsel for the plaintiff objected and the matter was relisted on 19 March 1998.

Counsel for the plaintiff argued that the defendant was not entitled to put further submissions to me because of the agreement between counsel set out in the affidavit of Michael Lyndon Malanos sworn 18 March 1998 which I admitted and read. I did not agree with counsel for the plaintiff as I regarded the events of 9 March 1998 as a very helpful clarification of the issue before me as I have stated it above, namely: was the plaintiff company the owner of the land in question at midnight on 31 December 1987 and thereafter within the definition of that term in [s.3(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/s3.html) of the [Land Tax Management Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/)?
Accordingly, I allowed Mr. Sorensen, replacing Mr. Lakatos, on behalf of the defendant to make further submissions on that issue.

The definition set out in [s.3(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/s3.html) of the [Land Tax Management Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/) reads as follows:- "'Owner' includes:- in relation to land, every person who jointly or severally, whether at law or in equity:- is entitled to the land for any estate of freehold in possession; or is entitled to receive, or is in receipt of, or if the land were let to a tenant would be entitled to receive, the rents and profits thereof, whether as beneficial owner, trustee, mortgagee in possession, or otherwise; ..." 
The plaintiff contends that the resolution of 25 July 1986 (Annexure B) and the resolution of 22 December 1987 (Annexure C) result in Mr. and Mrs. McCann becoming the owners of the premises within the meaning of that definition in s.3(1) of the 1956 Act. Alternatively, it was contended that if Mr. and Mrs.
McCann did not become the owners, then Mr. and Mrs. McCann and their three children became the owners by reason of the default provisions in clause 4(2) of the Trust Deed. This alternative contention arises if the resolution of 25
July 1986 (Annexure B) was not sufficient compliance with the terms of clause (1) of the Trust Deed JMM-2 which required any appointment of particular beneficiaries to be "by instrument in writing". The children were not represented before me and I do not consider it necessary to make a finding whether Annexure B is sufficient compliance with clause 4(1) so as to vest the
Trust Fund in the parents to the exclusion of the children because as will appear, I am satisfied that the effect of Annexures B and C was to prevent the plaintiff from coming within the definition of "owner" in [s.3(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/s3.html) of the [Land Tax Management Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/).

No argument on behalf of the defendant was advanced attacking the power of the
Trustee to make the two resolutions recorded at Annexure B and Annexure C. An argument was put forward, however, that the plaintiff did not hold the legal estate to the land in question when it purported to vest that land in Mr. and
Mrs. McCann on 22 December 1987.

I reject the latter argument by reason of the wording of clause 1(11) of the
Trust Fund Deed, JMM-2, defining the Trust Fund and how it was held by the trustees. Mr. McCann deposed that the relevant properties were acquired by the trustee upon the Trusts in the Deed and this is not disputed. In addition, clause 2 of the Deed sets out the declaration of trust upon which the trustees stand possessed of the Trust Fund. Accordingly I find that the trustees did have the legal estate in the properties at all material times and in particular at the time of the resolutions of 25 July 1986 and 22 December
Whether or not the appointment made on 25 July 1986 was or was not revokable is immaterial in my view because nobody on the evidence attempted to revoke it.

It was argued on behalf of the plaintiff that the effect of the two resolutions was to leave it as a bare trustee with the sole principal remaining duty to execute a transfer when called upon but that the plaintiff did not have any right to the land for any estate of freehold in possession nor was it entitled, if the land were let, to receive the rents and profits thereof within the definition of owner in [s.3(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/s3.html) of the [Land Tax Management Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/) because the power of appointment had validly been exercised to vest such entitlement in Mr. and Mrs. McCann, alternatively in Mr. and Mrs. McCann and their three children, as from 22 December 1987.

The plaintiff relied upon the decision of Mr. Justice Sully in Opalfield
Pty. Limited v. Commission of Land Tax (New South Wales) 93 ATC 4863, in particular, the discussion by his Honour of the concept of a bare trustee at pp.4869-4870. His Honour concluded that a bare trustee (a situation which he found to exist in that case) did not have a present right of beneficial enjoyment so as to make a bare trustee the owner within the definition in [s.3(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/s3.html) of "owner" of the [Land Tax Management Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/). That decision went to appeal, see 94 ATC 4171 where, as I understand the judgments, his Honour's interpretation of the meaning of "owner" in [s.3(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/s3.html) was not disturbed, however the appeal was allowed on the basis of the application of [s.26(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/s26.html) of the Act, a provision which both counsel agreed is not relevant to the present case.

Mr. Sorensen, on behalf of the defendant, did not go so far as I understood him to say that Sully, J. was wrong but submitted that his decision was distinguishable on the facts, and that proper consideration had not been given to the effect of [s.24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/s24.html) of the [Land Tax Management Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/). He submitted that the plaintiff was an owner within [s.3(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/s3.html) of the Act because it was, he said, entitled to receive rents if the property were let. He further submitted that as the properties appeared to be subject to mortgages, the plaintiff had contingent liability in respect thereof and therefore had a beneficial interest in the trust fund. He submitted that, insofar as Annexure B purported to impose an obligation upon Mr. and Mrs.
McCann to discharge the plaintiff's liabilities, it was invalid.

It is necessary in my judgment to look at the commonsense of the situation arising as a result of Annexures B and C. In my view the plaintiff was left with no right or interest in the land other than to convey it upon demand to the beneficiaries or as directed by them. Vis a vis the beneficiaries, be they
Mr. and Mrs. McCann or Mr. and Mrs. McCann and the three children, the plaintiff had no right to possession nor to let the land nor to deal with it in any way other than to execute a conveyance upon demand.

As far as [s.24](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/s24.html) is concerned, the land was not "vested" in the plaintiff at the relevant date by reason of Annexures B and C. Similarly, the Trust Fund was no longer vested in the plaintiff, and therefore whether or not clause 4(1) of the Trust Deed permitted the trustee to impose obligations upon Mr. and Mrs. McCann is immaterial.

In my judgment, therefore, the effect of the resolutions of 25 July 1986 and December 1987 which I find to have been validly made under the terms of the
Trust Deed, was to render the plaintiff a bare trustee as from 22 December and therefore in accordance with the view of Sully, J. and in my own view, not capable of being described as an owner of the subject property inasmuch as the plaintiff was not entitled to the land for any estate of freehold in possession nor was it entitled to receive the rents and profits thereof.

The substantive argument advanced by Mr. Lakatos on behalf of the defendant was that the provisions of [s.23C(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) had not been complied with. The defendant contended that [s.23C(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) applied, that [s.23C(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) did not apply, and that the resolutions of 25 July 1986 and 22 December 1987 were not sufficient documentation within [s.23C(1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html)
The plaintiff contended that [s.23C(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) was the relevant section and that the two resolutions referred to were sufficient writing to come within that section and pass beneficial ownership to Mr. and Mrs. McCann.

The relevant parts of [s.23C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) are as follows:- "(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act with respect to the creation of interests in land by parol:- no interest in land can be created or disposed of except by writing signed by the person creating or conveying the same, or by his agent thereunto lawfully authorised in writing, or by will, or by operation of law, a declaration of trust respecting any land or any interest therein must be manifested and proved by some writing signed by some person who is able to declare such trust or by his will, ..." 
It was common ground that the trustee had not executed and registered a transfer of title in the property to Mr. and Mrs. McCann or indeed to anybody else. The issue arises whether that is fatal to the plaintiff's claim.

In support of the sufficiency of the documentation, the plaintiff relied upon paragraph 864 of Volume 36 (4th ed.) of Halsbury's Laws of England, two passages from Hanbury & Martin's Modern Equity (14th ed.) at p.171 under the heading "Powers of Appointment" and at p.175 under the heading "Exercise of Powers of Appointment, A. General Rule, (i) Inter Vivos"; a passage from the Principles of the Laws of Trusts (2nd ed.) by Ford &
Lee at paragraph 610 and in particular the authority there cited, namely
Re Strathblaine Estates Limited [[1948] Ch. 228] in which Jenkins,
J. held that the signed Minutes of Directors and Shareholders meetings were sufficient compliance with s.53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925, the
English equivalent of the section of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) under consideration.

I am satisfied in the light of the above matters that the documentary evidence in this case, namely the Trust Deed and the two resolutions are sufficient documentary compliance with [s.23C(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/).

In support of its contention that [s.23C(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) was the applicable provision as opposed to [s.23C(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html), the plaintiff relied upon the Secretary, Department of Social Security v.
James <case>; [95 ALR 615] adopted and applied by Kearney, J. in Hagan & Ors v. Waterhouse &
Ors [(1991) 34 NSWLR 308.] The effect of those two decisions is that [s.23C(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) operates independently of [s.23C(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) and I find that the effect of the relevant documentation, namely the Trust
Deed and the two resolutions was that as at 22 December 1987 there was a declaration by the trustee that thenceforth the land vested in Mr. and Mrs.
McCann absolutely and I find that such documentation was sufficient compliance with [s.23C(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) which is the appropriate subsection to deal with the matter.

Accordingly, I find that the plaintiff was not the owner of the subject property as at midnight, 31 December 1987 within the meaning of that term in [s.3(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/s3.html) of the [Land Tax Management Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ltma1956173/) and is therefore not liable to pay the tax claimed.

I make the following orders:-
The appeal is allowed.
The defendant's decisions of 26 June 1996 are set aside.
The plaintiff's objections of 19 February 1996 are allowed.
The land tax assessments are reduced to nil.
The defendant is to pay the costs of this appeal.
