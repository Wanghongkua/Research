JUDGMENT:  /06 Re J and the [Adoption Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/)  
JUDGMENT  November, 2006  This is an application for the adoption of an adult by his stepfather. To preserve the anonymity of the parties as required by the [Adoption Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) , I will refer to the stepfather as A and to the person to be adopted as J. A is now 94 years of age and J is 57 years of age. A married J's mother when J was about two years old and J lived in the family home with his mother and A until he was about twenty years old. J has been married for about twenty-five years and has two children. J has lived continuously with his own family since his marriage.  The relationship between J and A has always been warm and loving. It is the earnest desire of both A and J, supported by their families, that their bond be formally recognised by the law. The affidavits filed by A in support of the application show that in every respect the adoption would be in the best interests of J and of the whole family. I would have no hesitation in making the adoption order.  Unfortunately, however, there is a legal problem and it is insuperable.
[Section (b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s30.html) of the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) relevantly provides that the Court "must not make an adoption order in favour of a step- parent of a child unless ... the step-parent has lived with the child and the child's birth or adoptive parent for a continuous period of not less than three years immediately before the application for the adoption order".
"Child" in this context includes an adult person.  In DG and the [Adoption
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/) <case>, Austin J carefully reviewed this section and, at paragraph 32, held that:  "... the requirement of [s (b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s30.html) that the step parent must have lived with the child means that they must have shared the same facilities of day-to-day living on a regular and recurrent basis, in circumstances where there is a close relationship of a parental kind between the step parent and parent and the child."  
I respectfully agree with his Honour's conclusion.  The evidence filed in the present case shows that J has lived in his own home with his own family at all times since his marriage, although he visits A very frequently. As Austin J held in DG, frequent visits to a stepparent's home do not qualify as living with the step-parent for the purposes of [s.30(b).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s30.html)
Accordingly, and very regrettably, [s.30(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s30.html) prevents the Court in the present case from making and adoption order, which would certainly have been made otherwise.  I entirely agree with the observations of Austin J in paragraphs 45 and 46 of the judgment in DG that [s.30(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa2000107/s30.html) should be amended as his Honour suggests. I join with his Honour in recommending to the Attorney General reform of the law in this regard.  In the result, however, I have no choice but to dismiss the Applicant's
Summons.  - oOo -
