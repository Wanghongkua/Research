REGINA versus GUNEY SEKER /96 
THURSDAY 30 JANUARY 1997 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COMMON LAW DIVISION 
SMART J (VIDEO LINK TO METROPOLITAN REMAND CENTRE) 
JUDGMENT - On application for bail 
HIS HONOUR: This is an application to vary the conditions of bail. There was a contested hearing before Bruce J on  November 1996. The offences involved as alleged by the Crown are attempted murder, malicious wounding, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. There does not seem to be any doubt that there was a serious assault upon the victim on the evening of 30 October, early morning of 31 October.

The Crown case is that Mr Barker and Mr Seker set upon the victim. Mr Seker has an extensive history, but many of the matters appear to be towards the lower end of the scale. On the 10 May 1996 he was sentenced to six months for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and three months for malicious damage.
An appeal was dismissed and the conviction and sentence were confirmed. The record reveals a substantial number of failures to appear.

The original surety was fixed in an amount of $100,000 after Mr Stojanovski had given evidence that he owned a house valued at $400,000. From the transcript it appears that a surety of $20,000 was proposed to his Honour, but that was not acceptable and I should record that the Crown took vigorous objection to a surety in that amount, having regard to the applicant's history.

Today his cousin has offered to provide $20,000 by way of a cash deposit. To put it mildly, I am sceptical about the statutory declaration of Mr Barker of November 1996, there being a reference in Ms Johnson's submissions to it to
Bruce J at pages 10 and 11 of the transcript of the November 1996.

Mr Naliba's statement of 13 January 1997 or possibly January 1997 is a very odd document, and one would need to know a great deal more about the circumstances under which it came into existence. In my opinion, having regard to the gravity of the offences and the history of the applicant, I am not prepared to vary the bail conditions by reducing the amount of security from $100,000 to $20,000.

It seems to me that in this case, even allowing for the difficulties of obtaining a surety in a very substantial amount, the minimum amount would be $50,000, and I would only be prepared to vary bail condition number 4. to this effect, that one acceptable person depositing $50,000 security and agreeing to forfeit that sum if the bail conditions are not reached. I am not prepared to reduce that amount further. The other bail conditions of 29 November 1996 would remain.
