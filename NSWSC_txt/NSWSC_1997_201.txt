Re D S Millard & Son Pty Ltd` ` 5932/92` `16 May 1997` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` /92 - RE D S MILLARD & SON PTY LTD 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is a Notice of Motion brought by the Liquidator of D S Millard & Son Pty Limited under the Corporations Law in a very successful winding up. The winding up was in insolvency, but, from a number of factors, including the expertise of the Liquidator, there is a surplus of about $400,000 after paying all creditors 100 cents in the dollar. All creditors having been paid, there are no creditors left to hold a meeting. 
The Liquidator applies under <case>(b)(ii) of the Corporations Law for his remuneration. That section provides that if there is no resolution of creditors and no committee of inspection, the court must fix the remuneration.
Judges are not really qualified to work out remuneration. If a judge is asked to do so, it may well be that, in the normal course, he will either refer it to the Registrar for advice or get independent evidence as to the reasonableness of the remuneration. However, in this case, the only person affected, the sole shareholder, has consented to the amount which the
Liquidator claims. Accordingly, I will make an order in that amount.

Section 480(2) of the Corporations Law makes it quite clear that "a Liquidator may distribute a surplus only with the Court's special leave". It is quite obvious that Mr Millard is entitled to a distribution of the whole of the surplus in this case, and I will make that order.

I was disturbed by the words "special leave". However, neither my own researches, nor the researches of the experienced solicitor, who appears for the Liquidator, have found any guidance. It seems that the words merely mean that a special application must be made to the court rather than the matter being dealt with as part and parcel of some other administrative procedure.

Accordingly, I make orders 1, 2 and 3 in the Notice of Motion of 30 April .
