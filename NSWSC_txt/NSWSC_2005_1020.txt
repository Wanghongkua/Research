TUESDAY, 11 OCTOBER 2005  /04 AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS COMMISSION versus ELM FINANCIAL SERVICES PTY LTD & 11 ORS  
JUDGMENT  The plaintiff, Australian Securities and Investments Commission, has instituted proceedings in which contraventions of various statutory provisions are alleged against five individuals in relation to activities of a group of companies sufficiently described, for present purposes, as the Elm Group.  I am about to begin the hearing of those proceedings. First, however, I must deal with two applications, one by ASIC and the ninth defendant (Mr Andrew
Dennis Terracini) and the other by ASIC and the twelfth defendant (Mr Howard
Young). The application is, in each case, an application that orders be made by consent disposing of the proceedings as they affect the particular defendant. The orders include, in each case, several declarations of contravention of provisions of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) 2001 by the particular defendant, an order pursuant to [ss.206C(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s206c.html) and [206E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s206e.html)(1) that that defendant be disqualified from managing corporations for a stated period (seven years from the making of the orders in Mr Terracini's case and five years from the making of the orders in Mr Young's case), orders that the proceedings be dismissed as they affect Mr Terracini and Mr Young and orders that the parties bear their own costs.  As is made clear by, in particular, the decision of Bryson J in Re One.Tel
Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission versus Rich <case>; <case>; [(2004) 50 ACSR 500], a declaration of contravention under [s.1317E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1317e.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), being a declaration on a matter relating to public or analogous rights, should not be made by consent of ASIC and the person against whom ASIC has proceeded unless the court has a basis for being satisfied by evidence (including agreed facts) that the statutory conditions for the making of the declarations have been fulfilled.  A statement of facts agreed by Mr Terracini and ASIC (Exhibit T1) has been tendered, as has a statement of facts agreed by Mr Young and ASIC (Exhibit
Y1). The first runs to 47 pages and the second to 31 pages. Each deals with a number of events and circumstances bearing upon the allegations against the particular defendant in the proceedings. Those exhibits (and Exhibits T2 and
Y2, being copies of s.93AA undertakings given to ASIC) will be retained as part of the court record.  The detailed content of the exhibits need not be rehearsed here. In respect of Mr Terracini, it is sufficient to say that the agreed facts show to the requisite degree that he  contravened [s.727(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s727.html) on one occasion; contravened [s.945A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s945a.html) on nine occasions;  contravened [s.946A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s946a.html) on three occasions;  contravened [ss.1041E(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1041e.html), [1041F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1041f.html)(1)(a) and [1041H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1041h.html) on five occasions;  caused Elm Financial Services to commit several related contraventions of provisions of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/); and  contravened [ss.180(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) and [181](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s181.html)(1) by failing to prevent related contraventions by Elm Financial Services.  In respect of Mr Young, the agreed facts show to the requisite degree that he  contravened [s.727(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s727.html) on one occasion;  contravened [s.601ED(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ed.html) on one occasion;  contravened [s.945A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s945a.html) on two occasions;  contravened [ss.1041E(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1041e.html), [1041F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1041f.html)(1)(a) and s.[1041H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1041h.html)(1) on five occasions;  contravened [s.946A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s946a.html) on one occasion;  caused Elm Financial Services to commit several related contraventions of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/); and  contravened [ss.180(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s180.html) and [181](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s181.html)(1) by failing to prevent the contraventions by Elm Financial Services.  All the contraventions involved apparently deliberate failure to observe fundamental statutory rules directed towards protection of investors. The legislation proceeds on the clear basis that persons should be invited to invest in financial products only if statutory specifications concerning product structure and materials for decision making are met and if advice given or solicitations made are honest, frank and fairly based. Both Mr
Terracini and Mr Young failed in material and serious ways to abide by these rules and, in so doing, also failed in the duties owed by them as company officers. The agreed facts cause the court to be satisfied that the statutory conditions for the making of the declarations of contravention have been satisfied.  So far as consequences are concerned, the parties have, in each case, agreed a period of disqualification, with the disqualification being imposed through an order under [s.206C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s206c.html) so that [s.206A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s206a.html) operates to impose criminal sanctions if activities of the kind described in the latter section are engaged in during the term of the disqualification.  The parties have, in each case, agreed the duration of the disqualification.
That, however, does not absolve the court of its duty to consider the appropriateness of the penalty in the light of the agreed facts and the surrounding circumstances. This is made clear by the decisions of the Full
Federal Court in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd versus Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission <case>; [(1996) 71 FCR 285] and, more recently, Minister for Industry Tourism and
Resources versus Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd <case>; [[2004] ATPR 41-993] (and see, in the present statutory context, Australian
Securities and Investments Commission versus Vizard [(2005) 54 ACSR 395).] In the
Mobil Oil case (at [51]) the following propositions were seen as emerging from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods:  "(i) It is the responsibility of the Court to determine the appropriate penalty to be imposed under <case> of the TP Act in respect of a contravention of the TP Act.  
Determining the quantum of a penalty is not an exact science. Within a permissible range, the courts have acknowledged that a particular figure cannot necessarily be said to be more appropriate than another.  
There is a public interest in promoting settlement of litigation, particularly where it is likely to be lengthy. Accordingly, when the regulator and contravenor have reached agreement, they may present to the Court a statement of facts and opinions as to the effect of those facts, together with joint submissions as to the appropriate penalty to be imposed.  
The view of the regulator, as a specialist body, is a relevant, but not determinative consideration on the question of penalty. In particular, the views of the regulator on matters within its expertise (such as the ACCC's views as to the deterrent effect of a proposed penalty in a given market) will usually be given greater weight than its views on more "subjective" matters.  
In determining whether the proposed penalty is appropriate, the Court examines all the circumstances of the case. Where the parties have put forward an agreed statement of facts, the Court may act on that statement if it is appropriate to do so.  
Where the parties have jointly proposed a penalty, it will not be useful to investigate whether the Court would have arrived at that precise figure in the absence of agreement. The question is whether that figure is, in the
Court's view, appropriate in the circumstances of the case. In answering that question, the Court will not reject the agreed figure simply because it would have been disposed to select some other figure. It will be appropriate if within the permissible range."  There has been some criticism of this approach as involving "platitudes": see per Weinberg J in Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v
Derstepanian <case>
And in Vizard (above), the court imposed a higher penalty than that agreed by the partiers and sought by the regulator.  It is clear that the court is in no way constrained by the parties' agreement and that, having made the declaration of contravention, it must exercise its discretion as to penalty. In the present case, the factual background does not, to my mind, indicate that the respective periods of disqualification proposed by the parties are inadequate. Mr Terracini's culpability can be seen to be greater than Mr Young's but in saying that, I do not intend to suggest that either is undeserving of a significant period of disqualification having regard to the financial damage inflicted upon innocent people. Each has, however, acknowledged the error of his ways and has volunteered to vacate the relevant field of activity for a significant period.
I am satisfied that the periods of disqualification are appropriate.  In relation to Andrew Dennis Terracini (the ninth defendant), the court makes by consent the declarations and orders set out in the First Schedule to these reasons and notes and accepts the undertaking set out in that First
Schedule.  In relation to Howard Young (the twelfth defendant) the court makes by consent the declarations and orders set out in the Second Schedule to these reasons and notes and accepts the undertaking in that Second Schedule.
