EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
HER HONOUR: On 13 October RS Hulme J made interim supervision orders under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (see State of New South Wales versus Kamm <case> The application for final orders is listed for hearing before the court on 14 and 15 December.
Today, the matter comes before the Court in order that an application for an extension of the orders made by RS Hulme J could be pressed. The parties have appeared this morning, asking the Court to make orders in agreed terms, which appear in MFI1.
In the circumstances, given what is dealt with in RS Hulme J's October order and what the parties have agreed, I am satisfied that justice demands that the consent orders be made in the terms agreed.
Accordingly, for those reasons I make orders in terms of MFI1.
