Orders made
JUDGE1
KIRBY P, PRIESTLEY AND HANDLEY JJA Following the decision of the High Court (Sydney City Council v Garbeu Pty Limited <case>; [(1995) 69 ALJR 616)], these matters again came before this court, where the parties were able to reach a considerable degree of agreement on the appropriate orders.
The only matter of substance eventually not agreed was whether this court should make orders for costs of the proceedings in the Land and Environment
Court, and if so, what orders.
The saving of time and expense led this court to think it should make the orders.
The contest then remaining was whether the costs in question should follow what, as the successive appeals eventually showed, should have been the event in the Land and Environment Court, or whether no order for costs of those proceedings should be made. The latter orders were said to be in accord with the practice of the Land and Environment Court. However, so far as we are aware, the only practice of this kind which is in any formal sense established is confined to planning and building appeals: cf Maclean Shire Council v
Nungera Co-operative Society Ltd [(1994) 84 LGERA 13] 9 (CA).
In cases such as the present involving complex questions of law, commercial occupiers, and substantial amounts, heard by a Judge of the Land and Environment Court, we see no reason why the ordinary rule as to costs should not apply. This is well established in other taxation litigation in federal and state courts.
We were informed however that many rating appeals in the Court involving for example domestic occupiers and modest amounts, are heard by assessors of the Court, and that in cases of this kind the practice has been to make no order as to costs. The present cases are manifestly not of this kind. Our decision is not intended to affect any practice of the Court in rating appeals heard by assessors as administrative appeals on the models of the former
Taxation Boards of Review and Federal and State Administrative Appeals
Tribunals. No such practice is before us in these appeals.
We are therefore prepared to make orders in the form submitted in draft on behalf of the Council which have been prepared on the footing of what we think is the appropriate approach to costs orders in the Land and Environment Court in cases of this kind.
In the four notices of appeal to this court, the First Respondent was
Garbett Pty Limited, Citistate Corporation Limited and the Second Respondent
Chalford
Holdings Pty Limited and Citistate Corporation Limited. In the hope of lessening confusion we have altered counsel's draft by not using the formal description of the parties, but their names.
The potential for confusion in the names arose in part from two proceedings having been commenced concerning each rate notice, in part because of difficulties about parties, and in part because of duplications among some of the rate notices. Because of these matters and because of the different ways in which some of the rate notices have been treated, it is difficult to be sure that every matter necessary to be dealt with in the court's orders has been dealt with.
Counsel for the parties have tried to cover everything in their drafts, and, so far as the court can see, successfully.
However, in case after the making of the orders it is realised that some further matter needs attention or correction, we have added an order giving liberty to apply to any party, within fourteen days of the making of these orders, for purposes only of their formal clarification or correction.
The orders we make are as follows:
