SUMMONS DISMISSED /97 - WAYNE EDWARD BUTLER versus COMMISSIONER OF POLICE 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, Wayne Edward Butler, is a resident of New South
Wales who, on 10 June 1997, was arrested in this State upon a warrant issued in Queensland following a complaint that he murdered Celia Natasha Douty at
Brampton Island on 1 September 1983. The warrant had been issued by a justice at Mackay on 2 June 1997. On 12 June, a magistrate at Parramatta Local Court ordered the plaintiff's extradition to Queensland to face the charge, but suspended the order to enable an application to be made to this court for review, and granted the plaintiff bail. A summons in this court was issued shortly thereafter and I heard the matter on 17 and 18 November. The plaintiff is next to appear at Parramatta Local Court on 26 November.

The extradition of the plaintiff on the same charge had been sought in 1988 and was granted by a magistrate. However, the magistrate's order was set aside by Carruthers J on the basis that it would be oppressive to return the plaintiff to Queensland: Butler versus Morahan & Anor (Carruthers J, unreported, 12 October 1988). His Honour was exercising the jurisdiction conferred by [s (6)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/saeopa1992325/s18.html) and <case> of the Service and Execution of Process Act, 1901 (Cth), the legislation then in force. On the prosecution case, as it had been outlined, his Honour was satisfied that there was "no real chance" of the applicant being convicted at a trial, and he set aside the extradition order having regard to the principles enunciated by Kirby P in Binge versus Bennett [(1988) 13
NSWLR 578] at 584-5.

The prosecution evidence as it stood before Carruthers J is set out at pages -8 of his Honour's judgment, and I need not repeat it. It is sufficient to say that on 1 September 1983 the deceased, who was employed at a resort on
Brampton Island, went to the beach at Dinghy Bay to sunbake. The next day her body was found in that vicinity, covered by her towel. She had been bashed about the head, but there was no evidence that she had been penetrated sexually. However, semen was found on the towel. There was evidence that the plaintiff and his then wife visited the island on 1 September and that he left her for some hours, and from which it might be inferred that he went to Dinghy
Bay.

When arrested in 1988, the plaintiff declined to be interviewed by police on legal advice. However, shortly thereafter he supplied a blood sample, but scientific testing at that time did not link him to the semen found on the deceased's towel. Indeed, there was no scientific evidence tending to link the plaintiff to the death in any way. Nor was there any evidence of motive (apart from speculation arising from the fact that the deceased had been sunbaking nude). Carruthers J concluded that the evidence fell "hopelessly short of establishing a case of murder based on circumstantial evidence ... " (page 8).

Since that time there have been two significant developments: The Queensland police have obtained further evidence, and the Service and Execution of
Process Act, 1901 has been replaced by the 1992 Act of the same name. To understand the nature of the relief which the plaintiff now seeks, it is necessary to examine the procedure contained in the 1992 Act in relation to interstate warrants, and to observe how it differs from that established by the 1901 Act.

The Act 1901 
It is Division 1 of Part 5 of the 1992 Act which is relevant for present purposes. Section 82 provides that a person named in a warrant issued in one
State may be apprehended in another State. The procedure to be followed upon apprehension is set out in <case>. Section 83(8) provides: "Subject to subsections (10) and (14) and section 84, if the warrant or a copy of the warrant is produced, the magistrate must order: that the person be remanded on bail on condition that the person appear at such time and place in the place of issue of the warrant as the magistrate specifies; or that the person be taken, in such custody or otherwise as the magistrate specifies, to a specified place in the place of issue of the warrant." 
Subsection (10) provides that a magistrate must order the release of the person arrested if he or she is satisfied that the warrant is invalid. Neither subs (14) nor <case> are relevant for present purposes. Section 86 provides for the review by this court of an order made by a magistrate under <case>. By subs the review is by way of rehearing. Subsections (8) and (9) empower this court to confirm, vary or revoke the magistrate's order and, if the order is revoked, to make a new order.

Previously, the powers and duties of a magistrate in interstate extradition proceedings were set out in <case> of the 1901 Act. Section 18(6) provided that a magistrate could refuse extradition if it appeared that the charge was trivial, that the application for extradition had not been made in good faith in the interests of justice, or for any other reason it would be unjust or oppressive to make the order. Section 19 provided for review by this court of the magistrate's order, also by way of rehearing. It was accepted that the discretion to refuse extradition under <case> might be exercised where it appeared that the prosecution in the State seeking extradition had no prospect of success: Binge versus Bennett (supra) at 585B.

No such discretion is conferred upon a magistrate by the 1992 Act, and it is clear that its exclusion was deliberate: Lavelle [(1995) 82 A Crim R ], per Rowland J at 190. Upon production of the warrant, or a copy of it, a magistrate is bound to order extradition, unless he or she is satisfied that the warrant is invalid. As Pincus J observed in Gummer [(1994) 71 A Crim R 140] at , "... all a magistrate is concerned with is the question whether the warrant is invalid." It was decided in that case that the magistrate's enquiry is not confined to the face of the warrant, and evidence relevant to its validity might be received. For the purpose of the argument in that case, it was assumed that the Supreme Court's power of review under <case> was also confined to the validity of the warrant: per Fitzgerald P at 142, although
Pincus J (at 145-6) doubted that the section "was intended exhaustively to set out the extent of the Supreme Court's jurisdiction, in matters arising under
Div 1 of Pt 5 of the Act." 
For the plaintiff, it was argued that the Queensland warrant is invalid. Dr
Woods QC, who appeared with Mr Magnus for the plaintiff, acknowledged that any comfort his client might gain on this basis would be fleeting as the
Queensland police could promptly seek the issue of a valid warrant. However, it was also argued that the application for extradition is an abuse of process and, notwithstanding the limited scope of <case>, this court has inherent power to prevent such an abuse. It is necessary to deal with these matters in turn.

The Warrant 
The appropriate form of warrant is that approved by the Chief Executive under s 265 of the Queensland [Justices Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consolact/ja1886119/) (as amended). The warrant for the apprehension of the plaintiff does not comply with that form in two respects. (It seems that, in fact, a superseded form of warrant was used.) Firstly, it does not set out the name and address of the plaintiff in the manner prescribed. Secondly, and more importantly, it does not specify the magistrate's court in Queensland at which the plaintiff is to appear, which the form requires when the person named in the warrant is to be apprehended in another State.

Mr Saidi, counsel for the defendant, the Commissioner of Police, relied upon [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consolact/aia1954230/s49.html) of the [Acts Interpretation Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consolact/aia1954230/) (Qld), which provides that if a form is prescribed or approved under any Act, strict compliance with the form is not necessary and substantial compliance is sufficient. He referred, by way of analogy, to the decision of Neasey J in
Beams versus Samuels [(1969) 14 FLR 201] at 203-6, in which a warrant for the apprehension of a man for an unpaid fine under Pt
IVA of the Service and Execution of Process Act, 1901, did not strictly meet the requirements of the form prescribed by that Act, but was held to be "substantially in accordance" with that form within the meaning of <case> of the Act. Mr Saidi took me to other cases in which the sufficiency of compliance with a prescribed form arose in different contexts: see Ex Parte
Taylor [[1980] Qd R 253], Resort Management Services Limited versus Council of the Shire of Noosa [[1995] QPLR 213], and O'Sullivan versus Verebes (Qld C of A, unreported, 11
October 1996). None of these decisions is directly on point, but the principle which guides all of them is that the question should be approached in a common sense way, with an eye to the purpose of the legislation under which the form is prescribed and to the risk of injustice to the person to whom the form is directed.

Dr Woods did not press the failure to set out the name and address of the plaintiff in the prescribed manner as a matter of importance. He relied, primarily, upon the fact that the warrant does not specify the magistrate's court at which the plaintiff was to appear upon his return to Queensland. On the face of it, this is a significant deficiency. However, I consider that there is force in Mr Saidi's submission that that significance evaporates in the light of [s (8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/saeopa1992325/s83.html) of the [Service and Execution of Process Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/saeopa1992325/), which
I have set out above. That subsection requires the magistrate in the State where the warrant is executed to specify the place in the State requesting extradition at which the person apprehended is to appear (or is to be taken, if in custody). In those circumstances, I consider that the warrant is in substantial compliance with the approved form, and it does not appear to me that this omission causes any injustice to the plaintiff. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the warrant is invalid: [s (10).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/saeopa1992325/s83.html) 
Abuse of Process 
Dr Woods' major argument was that the application for extradition is an abuse of process because the Crown case against the plaintiff is no better than it was when the matter was before Carruthers J, and the plaintiff is prejudiced by the passage of time and, in particular, by the possible loss of significant evidence. Mr Saidi submitted that I should not concern myself with developments in the evidence since 1988 when Carruthers J gave his judgment, because it could never be an abuse of process to seek the extradition of a person on a valid interstate warrant.

For this proposition Mr Saidi cited a number of authorities, commencing with the Western Australian decision of Lavelle (supra). In that case the Full
Court reversed the decision of a single judge (reported at [(1994) 72 A Crim R )], staying an order for extradition in a magistrate's court as an abuse of process. Rowland J, who gave the leading judgment, said (at -90): "It seems to have been overlooked in this case that the Court of Petty
Sessions was in fact exercising power under Commonwealth legislation pursuant to which it was directed, relevantly in the circumstances which are not disputed, to make an order for extradition if the warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction in another State or Territory was not invalid. In exercising power under the Commonwealth legislation, the Court of Petty
Sessions is bound to give effect to a valid warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction of another State or Territory. ... It cannot be an abuse of process of the Court of Petty Sessions of Western Australia to exercise a power it is bound to, and, in the circumstances of this case, obliged to, exercise in accordance with an Act of the Commonwealth." 
Malcolm CJ and Walsh J agreed, the Chief Justice observing (at 188): "[Section (8)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/saeopa1992325/s83.html) of the [Service and Execution of Process
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/saeopa1992325/) has the effect that unless the magistrate is satisfied that the relevant warrant is invalid, the magistrate must order either that the person be remanded on bail to appear in the place of issue of the warrant or that the person be taken in custody to the place of issue or some other specified place. The only additional power which the magistrate has is to make the order subject to other specified conditions in accordance with [s (9).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/saeopa1992325/s83.html)
Where the warrant is found to be valid, as in this case, I am quite unable to accept that either the application for or the making of an order for extradition can constitute an abuse of the process of the Court of Petty
Sessions which would attract the inherent jurisdiction of this Court. One effect of the amendments to the legislation is that any question of abuse of process or stay or proceedings will be one for courts of competent jurisdiction in the State or Territory in which the warrant is issued." 
Of course, I am not bound by a decision of the Full Court of Western
Australia, but I would not lightly depart from it. In Australian Securities
Commission versus Marlborough Gold Mines Limited  <case>; [(1992-3) 177 CLR 485], a case concerned with the Corporations Law, the High
Court said (at 492): "Although the considerations applying are somewhat different from those applying in the case of Commonwealth legislation, uniformity of decision in the interpretation of uniform national legislation such as the Law is a sufficiently important consideration to require that an intermediate appellate court - and all the more so a single judge - should not depart from an interpretation placed on such legislation by another Australian intermediate appellate court unless convinced that that interpretation is plainly wrong." 
In R versus Abbrederis [[1981] 1 NSWLR 530], a case in which the Court of Criminal Appeal was required to consider the interpretation by the Full Court of Victoria of a provision of the [Customs Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) (Cth),
Street CJ said (at 542): " ... I have not the slightest doubt that, where a Commonwealth statute has been construed by the ultimate appellate court within any State or Territory, that construction should, as a matter of ordinary practice, be accepted and applied by the courts of other States and Territories so long as it is permitted to stand unchanged either by the court of origin or by the High
Court. The risk of differing interpretations amongst the States is thus negated and, in practical terms, a uniform application of Commonwealth laws throughout Australia is assured.

A valuable exposition of the practice of courts of one State or Territory following, as a matter of comity, decisions of the appellate courts of others is to be found in the judgment of Clarke JA in Fernando versus Commissioner of
Police [(1995) 78 A Crim R 64] at -6. With respect, I have some reservations about the uncompromising stance adopted by the Full Court in Lavelle, but I would not presume to hold that the decision is "plainly wrong". In any event, it finds support in other authority. I have already referred to the tentative view of Pincus J in
Gummer that <case> of the Act does not oust the remedies available in the inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The contrary view was expressed by
Batt J of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Re Dalton [(1995) 120 FLR ]
at 412, where his Honour said: " ... it is clear from the terms and structure of <case> and from the context in which it finds itself in [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/saeopa1992325/index.html#p5) of the [Service and Execution of Process
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/saeopa1992325/) that it is intended to cover the field of proceedings or steps to challenge an order under [s ."](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/saeopa1992325/s83.html) 
In Lewis versus Wilson [(1987) 90 FLR 251], a case under the 1901 Act, the New South Wales Court of Appeal considered, without deciding, whether the court's inherent power to prevent an abuse of process extended to interstate extradition. Samuels JA (at 254) inclined to the view that <case> of the old Act, referred to above, established "exclusive statutory guidelines to be applied in cases of this kind." Priestley JA (at ) expressed "considerable doubt" whether the principles relating to abuse of process "have any application to a case where what is being considered is a charge pending in the courts of another State." His Honour added: "It could hardly be said that abuse of process can be involved in New South
Wales when an application is being heard pursuant to the [Service and
Execution of Process
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/saeopa1992325/) in regard to a warrant issued in another State in respect of charges pending in courts of the other State. It is for the other State to safeguard its own process from abuse." 
It must be said that, given the breadth of the discretion to refuse extradition conferred by the old Act, it is difficult to see why it would ever have been necessary to resort to the notion of abuse of process. Nevertheless, their Honours' remarks add weight to the view of the new Act taken by the Full
Court in Lavelle.

The effect of Dr Woods' submissions was that, as the proceedings against the plaintiff in Queensland would be an abuse of process, it would be an abuse to order his return to that State for that purpose. In the light of the authority to which I have referred, I do not consider that there is any basis for this court to prevent the plaintiff's return to Queensland. Whether the proceedings would be an abuse is a matter for the courts of that State to determine. For this reason, it is neither necessary nor appropriate that I express any view about the significance of developments in the evidence, both for and against the plaintiff, since this matter was before Carruthers J in 1988.

Conclusion 
Accordingly, the summons must be dismissed. I shall hear the parties on consequential orders and costs.
