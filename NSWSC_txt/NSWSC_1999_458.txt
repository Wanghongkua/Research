JUSTICE DAVID LEVINE 
MONDAY 17 MAY 1999 
JOSEPH ASSAF (First Plaintiff) 
ETHNIC COMMUNICATIONS PTY LIMITED (Second Plaintiff) v

THEODORE SKALKOS (First Defendant) 
FOREIGN LANGUAGE PUBLICATIONS PTY LIMITED (Second Defendant) 
JUDGMENT (Imputations - capacity) Pursuant to my judgment of 30 April 1999 the plaintiff was granted leave to file in Court, on 14 May 1999, a Second Further Amended Statement of Claim.
 The relevant amended imputations are 7(a) and 7A(a): "he exploits publishers of ethnic community newspaper for his selfish financial purposes, by selling government advertising to them at exorbitant prices". And paragraph 8A(a) "it exploits publishers of ethnic community newspapers for its selfish financial purposes, by selling government advertising to them at exorbitant prices".
 Pursuant to SCR Pt 31 r 2 the plaintiffs seek orders that each of the matters complained of be held to be capable of giving rise to the imputations pleaded in this Second Further Amended Statement of Claim, that each is capable of being defamatory and thus, each should go to the jury.
 There was no opposition to my considering these matters on the motion of the plaintiffs. I have done so in the light of the judgment delivered on 30 April
I have concluded that the matters complained of are capable of conveying the imputations pleaded in the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim and that each imputation is capable of being defamatory.
 The formal orders are: 
Imputation 7(a), (c), (d), (e); 7A(a), (c), (d), (e); 8(a), (c), (d);
A(a), (c), (d) will go to the jury.

I otherwise confirm Orders 5, 6 and 7 made in my judgment of 30 April 1999 and that the matter be expedited.

Liberty to restore to the Defamation List on 7 days notice.

Costs of the directions hearing on 14 May 1999 to be costs in the cause.
