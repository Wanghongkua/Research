BUSH versus HANLON & ANOR /92 August 1998 
Young J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is a partnership dispute over a rural property, "Amaroo" near Brewarrina. 
The partnership between the plaintiff Geoffrey Bush as to one half, and the defendants, David and Susan Hanlon (who are husband and wife) as to the other half, was a partnership at will to acquire and manage Amaroo. There is no doubt that the partnership came into existence and that it was dissolved on 25
July 1990. I declared that it was duly dissolved at the commencement of the hearing.

The property Amaroo was held under a perpetual lease pursuant to the [Western
Lands Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wla1901163/). The lease was at all material times land under the Torrens system and given the
Folio Identifier 2317/764263. The registered proprietors since acquisition are the first and second defendants.

A contract was entered into by the first and second defendants to purchase
Amaroo dated 29 September 1989 and exchanged on 1 October 1989. Both defendants signed the contract. The second defendant says, however, that she did so only because the first defendant had already paid the deposit out of their joint banking account and she felt locked in. I found this hard to believe because almost always a full deposit is paid on exchange of contracts which by definition happens after the contract is signed. However, no evidence was presented to me by either side which enabled me to make a conclusive determination on the point.

Although the property had been inspected by both the plaintiff and the male defendant, the plaintiff's name never got onto the title. There is some suggestion in the evidence that this was because there would be complications in getting approval to the transfer through the Minister for Lands if the plaintiff was added because he may have held other rural property. The purchase price including stamp duty and legal fees meant that the partners were liable for $622,000. Of this amount, $400,000 was borrowed on mortgage, the mortgage being in the name of the defendants, and the balance was paid as to $111,000 by each set of partners.

The partnership ran into problems almost from the beginning. The purchase was completed on 1 February 1990. On Wednesday 11 April 1990, the rain in the area was so heavy that the property was flooded and 1300 sheep were lost.

A week later the plaintiff sold his house in order to reduce his borrowings.
He obtained just under $1.7 million which he invested for a month and the moneys were released to him on 30 April 1990. It would seem that the plaintiff was in trouble with other business interests at this time.

The plaintiff says that he believed that the first defendant had entered into some share farming arrangement during May and there was a good possibility that the share farmer would buy out the plaintiff's interest. However, when this did not occur, and somewhere about the first week in June the plaintiff says he told the first defendant "I now have no other choice than to insist that the property be sold. I need my money, I am being pressed by the bank."
The first defendant says that he was told by the plaintiff "The property will have to be sold. I can't afford to pay anymore." Mr Hanlon denied that there was any suggestion that the share farmer might become involved in May/June
He said (T55) that the share farmer did not even inspect Amaroo until the last week in July 1990 because he could not get on to the property because it was so wet.

The vital conversation takes place on 25 July 1990. There is no doubt that there was a conversation between the plaintiff and the first defendant on that day at the plaintiff's office in Miranda.

The plaintiff's version is that the first defendant said to the plaintiff, "Geoff, I thought there was a moral understanding that one party should be able to purchase the other's interest and it is not fair that Susan and I should have to sell because you have financial difficulties. I am prepared to purchase your half today for $150,000.00, which I will need time to pay. If a
Stock and Station Agent finds a purchaser this month then you won't see your money until November anyway, so I want interest free until November." 
The plaintiff says he replied, "OK, but how are you going to pay me when you didn't have enough money to go into it in the first place? Also, does Susan know you're going to sell the home at Coffs Harbour and live at Amaroo? I know that Susan didn't like living in Yass so how is she going to like living at
Amaroo?" 
The first defendant allegedly replied, "I have spoken to Susan and she has agreed that we will sell our home in summer and rent a unit at Coffs Harbour as the house is not earning us any money and the property will." 
The plaintiff says he said, "What happens if it doesn't sell? How will you raise the money to pay me out?" to which the reply was, "It will sell, don't you worry, and if we sell it before June next year I'll pay you out earlier. I will also give $25,000.00 when the wheat crop comes in November after which I will pay you interest on your money but not on the ANZ penalty rate you're on now, but at my Westpac rate which is lower." 
The first defendant then asked for a credit against his future interest payment of $2,843 which was for half a four-wheel drive motor bike which he had recently purchased for Amaroo. The plaintiff said that the first defendant then wrote down the items that they had agreed on and signed it and handed it to him. The document is annexed and marked "C" to these reasons. The parties then shook their hands and said, "Deal is done".

In cross examination, the plaintiff admitted that he had not set out the full conversation in his affidavit and that the words which he had set out were prefaced by the first defendant saying that he recognized that the plaintiff had put about $150,000 into the project.

The first defendant's account was quite different. He says that the plaintiff said "I want to wind things up. I can't afford to pay any more money at all and I want out. All of my other businesses are going down and I need something from you to give to the bank." The first defendant says he replied, "We can't sell now, there will be huge losses if we do. My home is security for the property." The plaintiff then said, "Well I need something for the bank to say that I am going to receive some money. I am in diabolical financial trouble." 
The first defendant then says that the plaintiff dictated the document which is annexed "C" to these reasons, and the first defendant signed it at the plaintiff's request and gave it to him. He says he did not consult his wife prior to doing so, and that he only signed the document because the plaintiff had asked him for it so that he could show it to his bank. The first defendant says he did not consider himself to be in any way legally bound by the document; he only signed it because a friend had asked him to assist him by doing so.

The plaintiff said that there was an oral agreement by the first defendant to buy the plaintiff's share of the partnership for $150,000 on the terms noted.

The defendants in their defence and cross claim said that there was no such agreement, that the document signed by the first defendant was not a contractual document, and even if it were, it was never a document in which the second defendant had concurred. Furthermore, if there was an agreement for sale it was unenforceable, either under [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s54a.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/), or [s
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) of that Act. The first and second cross claims which were filed by the first and second defendants respectively also asked for a declaration that the partnership had come to an end and for accounts to be taken.

The second defendant also put on a cross claim against her husband (the third cross claim). Initially this was based on false and misleading conduct under the Fair Trading Act in and about his activities in the partnership without consulting his partner, the second defendant. This third cross claim really raises separate issues and I will deal with it after I have dealt with the primary issues that arise in the case.

The issues accordingly are:
Was there an agreement to sell the plaintiff's share in the partnership to the first defendant on 25 July 1990?
If the answer to question 1 is "yes", does the effect of either or both of [ss
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s54a.html) or [23C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) mean that the contract should not be enforced?
What relief should be given; and
What should be done about the third cross claim.

I will deal with these matters in turn.
I have set out the two conflicting versions of the conversation of 25 July
Both people who took part in that conversation were cross examined. They were the only people present, in particular the second defendant was not involved at all.

Both male parties were strenuously cross examined. I found it difficult to say that I preferred one to the other during cross examination. I got the feeling that neither party really was a person in whom I had complete confidence that he had fully remembered the conversation accurately.

The conclusion that I have reached is that it is more likely than not that the first defendant's version is correct.

There are two main problems with accepting the first defendant. The bigger of these problems is the fact that the document was in fact written. There is no doubt that the first defendant wrote what is appendix "C" to these reasons.
Either the document is a genuine recording of what occurred, or else it was manufactured for the nefarious purpose of misleading a bank.

There was cross examination of the first defendant to the effect that he was a person who was telling his own bank something contrary to the true facts in order to prevent pressure being applied by the bank. Mr Gruzman, who appeared for the plaintiff, put that these answers tended to show that the first defendant was not a person who was reliable and who would lie if he needed to.

However, the downside of this submission is that the first defendant was not a person who really considered that telling a few untruths to a bank was really morally reprehensible and on this basis the sin of setting up a document which his friend could use to relieve pressure from the friend's own bank was not something which the first defendant would find morally reprehensible. As I have thought about the matter it seems to me that the second position is more likely to be accurate.

Furthermore, the document itself does not include details about the transaction that one would normally expect to find in a memorandum which recorded what had occurred in a serious transaction. That is, entering into a partnership involving a property worth more than half a million dollars. The property was not named, the rights of possession and the livestock etc were not mentioned. It is difficult to accept that what was produced was seriously meant to be a formal record of the transaction, yet if it was not a formal record, why was it produced at all? The first defendant's version that it was produced merely as a piece of paper to put before the bank is accordingly reinforced.

The second main hurdle is that the first defendant showed for income tax purposes all the losses that had been made by the partnership before 30 June even though for that tax year the defendants had only been the sole proprietors for five days. This is consistent with a lay person thinking that because he had repaid the plaintiff for the plaintiff's investment in the property he was entitled to all the losses, but it is not so easily explained if the partnership had ceased on 25 July 1990 and there was to be an accounting. On this basis as at 30 June all three persons should have been shown as partners and all three should have received part of the loss.

However, if one emphasizes this factor, one may fall into the accountant's way of thinking which is not always the way that a used car dealer (the first defendant) and a plumber (the plaintiff) think about their rural activities.
The accountant's method of thinking involves a greater sophistication than perhaps either of these parties possessed.

Looking at the matter from the other side, there are two main problems, first that a large investment was disposed of so summarily, and secondly, caveats were lodged by the plaintiff against the title after the deal was allegedly done.

So far as the first matter is concerned, one would have expected that a person who had purchased a half interest in a property for $622,000 and who had bought a number of sheep would have had a fair idea of the quantum of his investment. Indeed, when the plaintiff thought about it afterwards he worked out that he had invested at least $180,000. A person might well have thought that he was entitled to more than the $150,000 proffered by the first defendant. However, there was no argument or haggling as to price and no time for consideration as to the price, but a straight out acceptance. This could be explained because the plaintiff was under such great pressure from other financial activities that he had no option but to accept anything that was offered for his part interest. However, it is a factor that tells against the plaintiff's version.

However, the most significant matter is that of the caveats lodged by the plaintiff.

The bundle of documents tendered by the first defendant, Exhibit DX02, contains two caveats which were lodged against the title to Amaroo.

The first of these caveats which is at p 72 of the bundle is dated 12 June , that is, before the alleged agreement, but was not lodged until 8 July
It claimed an interest as equitable co-owner in equal shares (50%) as tenant in common with the registered proprietors because of the contribution by the caveator of 50% of the purchase price. It is verified by statutory declaration. The second caveat on p 74 is in identical form lodged by the same solicitors on 25 January 1993.

For some strange reason I was not given any oral evidence about these caveats at all. In case the matter might have been overlooked, I actually mentioned this fact at the end of the oral evidence in case anyone wished to make an application, but no-one did. Thus the plaintiff was not asked anything about the caveats either in examination in chief or in cross examination.

Mr Gruzman put that the fact that the plaintiff had verified the first caveat by statutory declaration was of no moment because he had done so in June 1990 before the agreement. I appreciate that point. However, there is really no answer to the question I put to Mr Gruzman as to why solicitor White lodged the caveat on 8 July 1992 when he must have known that he was proffering to the Registrar General a statement that might have been true at the time when it was sworn, but was now untrue if the plaintiff's claim was correct.

A letter of demand (Exhibit PX01) dated 19 March 1992, was just tendered as part of the plaintiff's tender bundle without being described by any live witness. It is a letter signed by solicitor White. Whilst ordinarily one assumes that a letter duly addressed to a person is received by that person, and one assumes that if a person does not respond with a denial to a letter of demand, one can infer an admission, in the present case Mr Hanlon, in cross examination said that he could not ever remember receiving the letter. In the weak state of this evidence it is difficult to draw the inference that there was an implied admission by silence in not responding to the letter. In any event, the claim made in this letter was inconsistent with the claim that was made in the caveat.

Then, on 11 September 1992, the present statement of claim was filed together with an affidavit verifying of the plaintiff which was sworn before solicitor
White on 4 September 1992.

I was given absolutely no information as to what had happened to the caveat that was lodged in July 1992. I do know that the defendants signed a contract to sell Amaroo for about $400,000 in November 1992 and this may have sparked a second caveat if the first one somehow or other had been withdrawn. The second caveat was verified by solicitor White and, as I have said, put forward the claim that the caveator was entitled to a half interest in Amaroo because of his contribution to the partnership. This could only be true if the version of the "transaction" of July 1990 was as the first defendant says. Solicitor
White was not called. I was given no background information. The claims made to the Registrar General in the caveat which were proffered by solicitor
White, doubtless on instructions, are just inconsistent with the present claim.

I realize there was no cross examination of the plaintiff on this matter, but it must be remembered that it is not the duty of cross examining counsel to give the opposing party the opportunity to explain a fatal defect in his case.

For these reasons I find it more likely than not that no binding agreement was made on 25 July 1990.
This makes the second question as to whether, if there was such an agreement, it was enforceable under [ss
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) or [54A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s54a.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) otiose.
However, in case the matter should go elsewhere I will briefly deal with it.

Although not all the authorities are consistent, the predominant view is that despite the fact that <case> of the Partnership Act of 1892 has put the equitable doctrine of conversion into statutory form so far as partnership assets are concerned, each partner actually has an interest in each and every asset of the partnership. A partner's interest is not adequately described as being a chose in action to have the partnership property properly administered. This clearly was decided in Canny Gabriel Castle Jackson
Advertising Pty Ltd versus Volume Sales (Finance) Pty Ltd <case>; [(1974) 131 CLR 321], 327; Van der Waal versus Goodenough [1983] 1 NSWLR 81, 91-92;
Connell versus Bond Corporation Pty Ltd [(1992) 8 WAR 352], 363-373 (particularly p 373) and the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in
Suncorp Insurance and Finance versus Commissioner of Stamp Duties <case>; [(1997) 36 ATR 514], 520, where the cases are mentioned in footnote 25. In
Victoria, in Duckett versus Collector of Imposts <case>; [[1927] VLR 457], 466-7, the Full Victorian Supreme Court led by Cussen, J reached the same conclusion as did the English Court of Appeal in Steadman v
Steadman [[1974] 1 QB 161.] Although this case went on appeal, see [[1976] AC ], the current point was not affected. In the light of this strong authority, including two decisions of State Full Courts, the contrary decision of White,
J in Chettle versus Brown [[1993] 2 Qd R 604] should not be followed.

The partnership was not just to work Amaroo, but also to hold Amaroo as part of the partnership assets. As even an equitable interest in Amaroo would be land within the meaning of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/), the disposition of the interest would need to comply with [s
A.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s54a.html) [Section
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s54a.html) essentially requires a note or memorandum evidencing the transaction. Not every note will satisfy the section. In former years a lot of time and energy was spent by judges defining the parameters of an acceptable note in writing.
These days it is sufficient to adopt the formula used by some academics known as "the 4 Ps". This is that the note or memorandum must contain the Parties,
Property, Price and Promises. "Promises" means a note of the significant terms of the contract between the parties. It is quite clear on its face that the document attached as appendix "C" does not contain the 4 Ps. It does not identify the property, it does not name the parties, there is a figure mentioned though it is not said to be the price, and certainly there is no adequate summary of the promises.

Mr Gruzman sought to escape from those deficiencies by saying that the document, appendix "C", could be read together with the statement of claim.
However widely one reads the doctrine of reading documents together to constitute a note or memorandum, it could not embrace reading the statement of claim together with the document because there is just insufficient connection between them.

The matter of part performance was raised. However, in this case the plaintiff merely sues for damages and the doctrine of part performance is only relevant when one is considering an equitable claim: J C Williamson Ltd versus Lukey <case>; [(1931) 45 CLR 282], 297;
O'Rourke versus Hoeven [[1974] 1 NSWLR 622], 625.

Accordingly, had I found a contract on the facts it would have been unenforceable under [s
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s54a.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/). For this reason it is not necessary to consider [s
C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s23c.html) of that Act.
It follows that the plaintiff's proceedings must be dismissed.

It also follows that the affairs of the partnership need to be wound up under the supervision of the court so that the cross claims succeed and the matter should be referred to a Master to take accounts. It is clear that the defendants are the accounting party so that they should bring in short minutes which reflect an order before the Master for taking of accounts, an order that the defendants be the accounting party and lodge their accounts by a certain date, directions for surcharges and falsifications, vouching and cross examination if need be, and an eventual order that someone pay the balance due to the other. It may be that the parties would prefer a more informal procedure to settle the accounts. This would be much cheaper, but that is a matter for them. In default of agreement, there must be accounts taken before the Master in the traditional way.

I should note that it is quite clear that in those accounts the defendants will be liable under <case> of the Partnership Act to pay interest at 6% on the share of the plaintiff in the partnership assets used by them in their new partnership up until the partnership asset was disposed of in 1992/3, and possibly thereafter if they have continued to make use of the money.
There only remains the third cross claim.

This is a claim by a wife against a husband for exceeding his authority as her agent in making the agreement that the plaintiff says he made without consulting her. She pleads it various ways including a breach of the Fair
Trading Act. On the facts, the husband is not guilty as he made no agreement with the plaintiff for the reasons set out above. Accordingly this claim should fail with costs.

However, the point arises as to whether the cross claim is maintainable in any event. Up until the [Married Persons (Equality of Status) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mposa1996396/), [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mposa1996396/s6.html), which came into force on 6 March 1997, a wife (or a husband) had only limited capacity to sue a spouse. That Act removes the barrier brought about by the common law presumption that husband and wife are one person.

Ordinarily a wife can only sue her husband in the Family Court. It is government policy that if the regrettable stage is reached that husbands and wives cannot sort out their own disputes that they should have them resolved before the specially caring court which has been created by the Commonwealth to deal with family disputes. This policy is enshrined in [s 4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/s4.html) of the [Family Law Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fla1975114/) which, subject to the Cross Vesting laws, gives exclusive jurisdiction in matrimonial causes to the Family Court. Paragraph (ca) of the definition of "matrimonial cause" includes disputes between parties to the marriage with respect to the property of the parties of the marriage or either of them arising out of the marital relationship.

Mr De Buse for the wife, says that the present proceedings do not arise out of the marital relationship; they arise because the husband and wife are partners in a business venture. He says it is immaterial that the problems occurred because the wife left virtually all her business affairs to her husband to carry out.

As I said in Richardson versus Gill (16 October 1997, unreported but affirmed by the Full Family Court [[1998] Fam CA 64)], no court has ever decided just how wide the words "arising out of the marital relationship" are.

Cases such as Re Kowalski [(1992) 16 Fam LR 235] suggest that once a marriage has been celebrated between the parties their entire relationship thereafter arises out of the marital relationship. This broad proposition cannot be correct because, if it was, there would be no reason for the legislature to add the words "arising out of the marital relationship." This addition shows that there must be some property matters not so arising. It seems to me that where there is a pure property dispute a fortiori a property dispute involving business assets where the spouses are still living together and do not appear to be contemplating proceedings in relation to their marriage, that the dispute is not a property matter arising out of the marital relationship. Accordingly, the Family Court does not have exclusive jurisdiction.

This is contrary to my first impression, but having considered the matter in the light of Mr De Buse's written submissions, it seems to me that it is the correct approach to take.

Accordingly, whilst there is jurisdiction to hear the third cross claim it must be dismissed on the merits with costs.
