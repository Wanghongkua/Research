EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
On 4 December, 2015 I delivered a judgment in this matter in which I entered a judgment for the plaintiff and made various ancillary orders: Melenewycz versus Whitfield [2015] NSWSC 1482. When the matter first came on for hearing on 7 October 2015 Senior Counsel for each of the parties indicated that because a particular question of construction and law arose on the question of liability it was appropriate to determine the question of liability first, with the question of damages to be considered afterwards.
The question of law is set out in a little detail in the judgment previously published and concerns the interpretation of [s7E](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1999298/s7e.html) and I suppose also to some degree [s 7A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1999298/s7a.html) of the [Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maca1999298/) and the extent to which, if any, a driver in what might otherwise be considered to be a "blameless motor accident" can avail themselves of the provisions allowing for deemed fault on the part of the owner of the vehicle that they were driving.
As was put to me by Senior Counsel on both sides, the matter has not previously been subject of a decision of this or any higher court. There is also a decision of the Court of Appeal called Axiak versus Ingram <case>; [82 NSWLR 36]
After delivering judgment I allowed the parties a week or so to consider the most appropriate and efficient course for the future conduct of the proceedings. I am concerned not to increase the cost by fracturing the proceedings and splitting the issues of liability and damages, but I have been persuaded this morning that this is an appropriate case in which to allow the defendant to prosecute an appeal in the Court of Appeal before determining the question of quantum.
I accept that that is an unusual course, and possibly should be reserved for exceptional cases. If that is the test, and in any event, I am satisfied that the circumstances here are exceptional. I come to that conclusion for two main reasons. The first is that the parties have at all times, in an attempt to minimise the legal costs, focussed on the issue of liability and are not prepared to argue or adduce evidence on the issue of damages. I am told that the parties would need something in the order of nine to 12 months to obtain the necessary medical evidence that would go to that question. I have to say that surprises me, but I accept it from people who have more experience than I do in such matters. By that time, one would expect that the Court of Appeal would have at the very least heard the matter, assuming that the Court grants leave for the matter to be argued.
Perhaps of more significance is that I am told (and I accept) that there are a number of cases in the pipeline which raise precisely the same issue. I have been informed this morning by Mr Jones, who initially appeared for the defendant, that he has had enquiries on behalf of various insurers as to what process would follow the judgment I delivered last week. Those insurers having a particular interest in the outcome of this point of law.
It would be false economy I think simply to proceed in this matter to determine the question of damages. I had encouraged the parties to reach agreement on that subject but I am told that they remain very far apart. The false economy would arise because of the fact that many other cases would be heard by individual judges of this Court, and the District Court, when ultimately a case at some point is going to have to get to the Court of Appeal for determination of this particular point of law, assuming the Parliament does not see fit to make the legislation clear.
For those reasons, I am persuaded that the joint position taken by the parties is correct, and that I should maintain the separation of the issue of liability from the quantification of damages. This will allow the defendant to exercise its right to seek leave to appeal from the judgment published on 4 December 2015. I will adjourn the matter into next year either for mention or directions. I can see no point in doing that before April, given the list in the Court of Appeal, and what I have now been told by Dr Rewell (who later appeared for the defendant this morning) is the likely timetable in that court.
So the matter is adjourned for mention or directions on Tuesday 26 April 2016. The parties have liberty to approach my Associate if there is any need for the matter to come back before me before that, and also to approach her if it is considered that a mention on that day will simply be a waste of resources, whereupon I will make orders in chambers accordingly.
