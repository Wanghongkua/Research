No 09/297729 
MILAN SIJUK versus ILVARIY PTY LIMITED, t/as, CRAFTSMAN HOMES 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: In these proceedings I delivered reasons for judgment on 29
April 2010. In that judgment I requested the parties to check the calculations of damages set out in the reasons for judgment. The parties have done so.
 On 20 April 2010 I gave further judgment, referred to as judgment number two, and a further matter was raised with the parties concerning the calculation of future domestic assistance. The parties have provided to my
Associate since then the calculations of damages, which are now agreed.
 I have been unable prior to this date to deal with this matter as I have been on long leave. It remains accordingly for me to enter judgment in these proceedings in accordance with the calculations which are agreed and as stated by Mr O'Dowd of counsel.
 Accordingly I note that the total calculation of damages under the [Civil
Liability Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cla2002161/) is the amount of $750,722. Damages are adjusted in accordance with the provisions of s.151(Z)(2), producing the amount of $706,605. In accordance with the finding of contributory negligence there is to be a deduction in the amount of 15% for contributory negligence, resulting in a judgment sum of $600,615.
 Accordingly I enter judgment in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant in the latter amount of $600,615.
 The plaintiff seeks an order for costs in the proceedings. In the circumstances the defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs.
