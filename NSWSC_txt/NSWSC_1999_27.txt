JUDGMENT: 
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
COMMON LAW DIVISION 
STUDDERT J 
Wednesday 10 February 1999 /93 BRUCE DALBY versus STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: In the course of his cross examination of the plaintiff in these proceedings, but in the absence of the jury, Mr Garling of Senior Counsel sought a ruling as to whether he ought to be allowed to cross examine the plaintiff about answers he gave in the course of cross examination on a hearing at arbitration that preceded this hearing but which related to the same subject matter as this cause. I now publish my reasons for refusing Mr
Garling's application.
 In the course of making his submissions Mr Garling referred the Court to answers which the plaintiff gave in cross examination before the arbitrator which were inconsistent with answers that he gave before the jury during the evidence elicited from him. Mr Garling submitted that having regard to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ea80/s43.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ea80/), 1995 the cross examination contemplated should be permitted.
 [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/s18.html) of the [Arbitration (Civil Actions)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/), 1983 provides for finality of the award of an arbitrator, but [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/s18.html) provides machinery for a re-hearing if an order is sought for that purpose "by a person aggrieved by the award". In the present case an order was sought and obtained pursuant to [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/s18.html) and hence the present proceedings before this Court. [Section (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/s18.html) is of particular significance having regard to the nature of the present application. It provides: "Where an order is made under sub-section (2): the award that gave rise to the order ceases to have effect; and ...the action to which the order relates shall be heard and determined in the Court as if it had never been referred to an arbitrator." (Emphasis added) My attention was drawn to an unreported decision of Finlay J in Najdavonic v Brown (22 September 1992) in which his Honour held that the effect of sub-s was to prevent either party on a re-hearing from "using any of the material, including the transcript of evidence, before the arbitrator (unless, of course, by consent to facilitate the hearing)".
 That decision was considered in the Court of Appeal by Priestley A-P in
Macdougall & Anor versus Curlevski [(1996) 40 NSWLR 430.] Whilst his observations in Macdougall were strictly obiter, his Honour tentatively expressed his concurrence with the ruling of Finlay J.
 I have had the advantage of considering the reasons for the decision reached by Finlay J on 22 September 1992. His Honour referred to the Second Reading
Speech that preceded but related to [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/s18.html) of the statute. What the Attorney General said about that sub-section was this: "The third proposal also relates to re-hearings. It is a practical requirement of the system that on a re-hearing the court must have no regard to anything that happened on the arbitration and, in general terms, the Act says so. The intent has been always that the introduction of compulsory arbitration should not frustrate the right of a party to insist on ultimately getting the action fully heard in the court in which it was commenced." It seems to me that it would be contrary to the objective expressed by the
Attorney General and to the language of the sub-section itself if the plaintiff could now be cross-examined about evidence that he gave before the arbitrator. The language of sub-s (3) is plain. This hearing is to proceed as though the action "had never been referred to an arbitrator". If the defendant was to be permitted to cross examine the plaintiff in the way in which it wishes to cross examine the plaintiff, sub-s (3) in my opinion would be contravened.
 I respectfully agree with the ruling of Finlay J in Najdanovic and having regard to the language of [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/aaa1983261/s18.html)
I do not permit Mr Garling to cross examine the plaintiff about evidence he gave on the arbitration proceedings.
