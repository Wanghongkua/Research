STATE RAIL AUTHORITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES versus NIGEL JOHN SMITH 
APPEAL - refusal of leave to re-open cross-examination - nature of trial judge's discretion in assessment of workers compensation payments - Workers Compensation Act 1926 , s11(1).

EVIDENCE - admissibility - confidential terms of settlement - [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/) , [s 131(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) 
The respondent had previously commenced and settled proceedings against his former solicitors for professional negligence after they had sued the wrong defendant in connection with a workplace injury suffered by the respondent.
The respondent then brought an application against the appellant in the
Workers Compensation Court for weekly compensation, during the course of which the appellant sought leave to re-open cross-examination of the respondent to explore the circumstances of that settlement as relevant to the assessment of weekly payments under s11(1) of the Workers Compensation Act 1926 .
Armitage CCJ refused leave on the following three bases, all of which the appellant challenges on appeal: that the details of the settlement were protected by the provisions of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/)  and were therefore inadmissible; that the parties to the settlement were bound by an agreement not to disclose the terms of the settlement; and that the court hearing the common law action and the Compensation Court were engaged in fundamentally different tasks and therefore it was not appropriate for the Compensation Court to re-examine the outcome of the common law proceedings (irrespective of whether they resulted in settlement or verdict).

HELD, dismissing the appeal: 
The trial judge erred in holding that the terms of settlement were not admissible under [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) is directed solely at communications between parties in an attempt to settle and is not concerned with the settlement document itself.
The trial judge erred in finding that the settlement was precluded from being accepted into evidence because the parties were contractually bound not to disclose the terms of settlement. There is ample authority that statutory prohibition on the disclosure of information does not operate when disclosure is required by coercion of law: Nestle Australia Ltd versus Commissioner of
Taxation [(1986) 11 FCR 453]; and the same principle applies in respect of confidential terms of settlement.
On a [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s11.html) determination, the court is involved in a threefold inquiry, only the third part of which is discretionary: * firstly, what is the difference between the weekly amount which the worker would probably have been earning as a worker but for the injury and had he or she continued to be employed in the same or some comparable employment?; * secondly, what is the worker earning or would the worker be able to earn in some suitable employment or business after injury?; * thirdly, what amount, being no greater than the difference between the first and second amounts, should be awarded to the worker?

STATE RAIL AUTHORITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES versus SMITH 
JUDGMENT 
PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with Beazley JA. 
HANDLEY JA: I agree with Beazley JA. 
BEAZLEY JA: This is an appeal from a decision of Armitage CCJ in which his Honour refused leave to the appellant to re-open cross-examination of the respondent. 
The appeal raises a short point of principle, directed not to the nature of the discretion which resides in a trial judge on an application to re-open cross-examination, which is well established, but to the nature of the trial judge's discretion under <case> of the Workers Compensation Act 1926  (the 1926 Act), in circumstances where an applicant has received common law damages for injury either by way of verdict or settlement.

Facts 
The respondent was injured on 13 February 1984 as a result of a collision between a motorcyclist and the train he was driving in which the respondent suffered nervous shock and the motorcyclist was killed. The respondent brought an action against the nominal defendant in respect of that injury, but this was the wrong defendant. By the time the mistake was realised the limitation period had elapsed. The respondent subsequently brought an action in negligence against his solicitors and barrister.

The respondent settled this action and then brought an application against the appellant in the Compensation Court for weekly compensation.

Before the Compensation Court matter proceeded to judgment, counsel for the appellant obtained an adjournment to seek instructions as to whether the appellant wished to re-open the cross-examination of the respondent to explore the circumstances of that settlement. On the further hearing of the matter, the appellant's counsel sought leave to further cross-examine the respondent as to the settlement. The respondent's counsel opposed the application but tendered a letter dated 10 October 1997 from McClellands, the respondent's solicitors to Messrs Gillis Delaney Brown, the appellant's solicitors. That letter stated: "We refer to your letter of 12 September 1997, and to our letter of 25
September 1997 and now enclose herewith a copy of a letter from Messrs
Phillips Fox of 8 October 1997. It seems we are precluded from providing the information you require.

We are sure you are aware of the decision in TIPPER versus WILLIAM [sic] (Court of
Appeal, unreported, 12 May 1993, 6 May 1994 and 14 June 1994), and other decisions.

In TIPPER's case, the Court of Appeal held:-
Future entitlements under the Workers Compensation Act (1926) should have been taken into account (at the hearing);
The amount which must be deducted is the discounted value of weekly payments (to death or retirement, depending upon date of accident), not the lesser amounts that would have been attained if the rights were redeemed under the Act.
This judgment is authority not only for the argument that the defendants are entitled to the benefit of a deduction in respect of the plaintiff's retained worker's compensation entitlements, but also that those entitlements are to calculated [sic] not upon their redemption value, but upon the basis of a discounted value of weekly payments in much the same way as loss of future earing capacity is assessed.

That approach was applied in our client's professional indemnity proceedings when our client's claim was reduced accordingly. His entitlements were reduced not only for the past, but also in respect of his rights for the future. We therefore cannot see why there should be any reduction or allowance made in the present proceedings, before the Compensation Court." 
Armitage CCJ rejected the application to re-open on three bases: the details of the settlement were protected by the provisions of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/) ; the parties to the settlement were bound by an agreement not to disclose the terms of the settlement; and the court hearing the common law action and the Compensation Court were engaged in fundamentally different tasks: the common law court was required to determine the value of the contingency that the plaintiff might enforce his available compensation rights whereas the Compensation Court was required to determine the actual value of the compensation rights.

The appellant contends that each of these bases was wrong in law and, therefore, his Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion against permitting the appellant leave to re-open cross-examination.

The first two bases for his Honour's decision may be dealt with briefly.
 [Section 131](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) is directed solely at communications between parties in an attempt to settle. It is not concerned with the settlement document itself. Counsel for the respondent properly conceded this was the case. His Honour therefore erred in finding that the terms of settlement were not admissible under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s131.html) 
Term "Not to Disclose" Terms of Settlement 
The parties, it appears, were contractually bound not to disclose the terms of the settlement. His Honour considered that the appellant should not be able "to force the [respondent] to breach that term ... having regard to the [respondent's] uncontradicted evidence ... that Tipper versus Williams was taken into account" in the settlement. The reference to the respondent's "uncontradicted evidence" is a reference to the letter of 10 October.

It appears his Honour, in this part of his reasoning, combined two concepts.
The first is whether the respondent could be required to "breach" his contract by disclosing the terms. The second is whether the terms of the settlement had any relevance to the determination which his Honour had to make. That issue conceptually forms part of the third basis upon which the discretion was exercised. Dealing with the first concept, there is authority that a statutory prohibition on the disclosure of information, such as is found in the taxation legislation, does not operate when disclosure is required by coercion of law, for example, by way of response to an order for discovery: Nestle Australia Ltd versus Federal Commissioner of Taxation [(1986) FCR 453]. I can see no reason of principle or policy why the same principle does not apply to a contractual prohibition on disclosure.

Application of Tipper versus Williams in a [Section 11(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s11.html) Determination 
The last issue involves a consideration of the principle in Tipper versus Williams (No 2) (unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 6 May 1994). The principle in that case, put shortly, is that the common law turns its face against double recovery. It does that in a common law action by requiring that the value of a plaintiff's future worker's compensation entitlements be deducted from the damages. In Tipper versus Williams, it was held that the correct approach to the valuation of that entitlement: "is that rights to receive weekly payments and other payments for the rest of the respondent's life should be valued in broadly the same way as the future impairment of his earning capacity subject only to [a discount for vicissitudes].

Before Armitage CCJ, the appellant contended that the principle in Tipper v
Williams permitted the Compensation Court, in the course of determining an application for partial incapacity under <case> of the 1926 Act, to examine any terms of settlement which an applicant had entered into "to ascertain whether the applicant was being partly or wholly compensated in that verdict for the effects of the accident upon which he presently bring [sic] application in this court". It was submitted that the principle also applied where a common law action proceeds to settlement rather than to verdict. It followed, on this argument, that if the Compensation Court determined that the applicant had been partly or wholly compensated for the effects of the accident, that would be a relevant factor to take into account in the exercise of discretion under <case>, with the consequence that the court would be entitled (and it would seem, on this submission would be required as a proper exercise of discretion) to reduce the amount of the award for partial incapacity made under <case>.

The function of the Compensation Court in making a determination under <case> is well settled. A threefold inquiry must be undertaken. First, it is necessary to ascertain the difference between the weekly amount which the worker would probably have been earning as a worker but for the injury had he or she continued to be employed in the same or some comparable employment.
This inquiry is an hypothetical or mechanical calculation and must be undertaken even if the worker could no longer be employed in the industry (for example due to a statutory prohibition: see Australian Iron & Steel Ltd v
Elliott [(1966) 67 SR 87)] or was no longer employed in the industry because of the acceptance of a redundancy package.

Secondly, the court must determine what the worker is earning or would be able to earn in some suitable employment or business after the injury. This is a factual inquiry which must be determined having regard to the circumstances in each case. No discretion is involved in the determination of the amounts derived from the first and second steps.

The third inquiry is as to what amount, being no greater than the difference between the first and the second figure, should be awarded to the worker. This determination is discretionary. However, as Kirby P said in O'Loughlin versus The
Zinc Corporation Ltd (unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 21
December 1989) at 2: "this discretion itself operates within parameters established by the first and second steps ... [as] it is they that produce the figure upon which the discretion operates." 
In AIS versus Elliott it was held that the fact that the worker had been compulsorily retired from the industry, whilst not a factor relevant to the calculation of the first amount, was relevant to the exercise of the discretion in the third stage of the <case>(a) determination. However, the relevance of such a factor needs to be understood. Sugerman JA stated at 92 - :
 "...the purpose of the provision...is to prescribe a maximum by reference to the hypothesis stated and not by reference to the potential earnings of the worker, if uninjured, in some other field. But the concluding words of the subsection require that, within the limit thus determined, the amount of compensation be assessed with due regard to the actual circumstances of the case and these circumstances would in proper cases include such matters as that the worker had passed the age of compulsory retirement from the coal mining industry and that therefore the measure of his actual earning capacity, had he not been injured, is what, in that event, he would have been able to earn in the general employment market other than the coal mining industry." 
However, an applicant's common law verdict or settlement is not, in my opinion, relevant to the third part of the exercise which is required to be performed under <case>. Whilst the law sets its face against double recovery, it does so by requiring, in common law proceedings, that the value of future workers' compensation rights be deducted from the amount awarded for loss of future earning capacity. There is nothing in the nature, scope or terms of the Act in general, or <case> in particular which permits a Compensation Court judge to consider whether the common law court has performed its task according to law (assuming the matter proceeded to judgment). That is the function of an appellate court.

The same applies as a matter of principle where there has been a common law settlement. Parties choose to settle a matter for a variety of reasons. In arriving at the settlement figure the parties may have placed differing emphases on different aspects of the damages claim. An investigation and assessment of one component only of that settlement sum, assuming it can be identified at all, may lead to a view of its value that does not reflect the basis on which either or both of the parties agreed to the settlement.
Alternatively, a compensation court judge might form a vastly different view as to a plaintiff's future earning capacity, the amount of workers' compensation which should be awarded and the vicissitudes which ought to have been applied to those of either of the parties. In effect, the compensation court judge could ignore the basis upon which the parties, in good faith, had negotiated their terms of settlement. In any event, the practical difficulties of the Compensation Court entering into such an inquiry are enormous, and are likely to be productive of injustice to one party or the other, or to both.

Accordingly, although Armitage CCJ erred in two aspects of his reasoning in refusing leave to further cross examine the respondent and although I have chosen to express my reasons differently from the third basis upon which his
Honour proceeded, I am of the opinion that his decision to refuse leave was correct.

Accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.
