FRIDAY 4 SEPTEMBER 2009  /09 ANTHONY WILLIAM BALDWIN versus AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS COMMISSION  
JUDGMENT  The plaintiff was one of two directors of Tipglisten Pty Ltd, the registration of which was terminated by Australian Securities and Investment
Commission pursuant to <case> of the [[Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) on July 2009. The plaintiff, who was also one of the shareholders of
Tipglisten, was the applicant for deregistration.
 On 24 August 2009, the directors of Tipglisten received a notice issued by the Commissioner of Taxation under <case> of the [Income Tax Assessment [Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) in respect of PAYG withholdings which, according to the Commissioner, Tipglisten had failed to remit. The amount involved is $45,099.
 Having regard to the statutory regime under which that notice was issued, the directors of Tipglisten, being the plaintiff and his wife, will become liable to pay the sum of $45,099 to the Commissioner of Taxation unless
Tipglisten is promptly wound up. The plaintiff and his wife desire to avoid that consequence and for that reason have it in mind to put Tipglisten into voluntary liquidation. They cannot do so, of course, because, as things now stand, Tipglisten does not exist.
 It is for that reason that the plaintiff now seeks an order under [s
AH(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ah.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) that
Australian Securities and Investment Commission reinstate the registration of
Tipglisten. If that order is made the existence of Tipglisten as a legal entity will be resumed with the kind of limited intervening continuity provided for by [s
AH(5).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ah.html) In the circumstances I have described, there can be no real doubt that the plaintiff is, in terms of [s
AH(2)(a)(i)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ah.html), a person "aggrieved by" the deregistration. The ongoing non-existence of
Tipglisten and, therefore, the impossibility of complying with the condition necessary to avoid personal liability of the plaintiff for the unsatisfied
PAYG instalments is sufficient to warrant that conclusion.
 The second question posed by [s
AH(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ah.html) therefore arises, that is, whether the court is satisfied that it is "just" that the company's registration be reinstated.
 Where, as here, the deregistration occurred as a result of a decision of the company's controllers, one must be strongly inclined to think that it will be just that registration should be reinstated in accordance with their wishes, since the reinstatement will allow them to take steps for their own protection under the taxation regime.
 Of course, one question posed by the requirement that the court be satisfied that it is just that the company's registration be reinstated whether any person will be prejudiced by the reinstatement. In the circumstances before me the only person who might possibly be said to be prejudiced is the
Commissioner of Taxation, but I do not think that that is an accurate view.
That possibility was addressed by White J in Application of Stojic  <case>; <case> I note, in any event, that the Australian Taxation Office was given notice of the application and indicated that it did not oppose it.
 ASIC's attitude to the application is conveyed by its letter to the plaintiff's solicitors. It is indicated that ASIC will not oppose the application if certain conditions are satisfied. Those conditions present no difficulty. I would, however, comment on one of them. It is a condition that the applicant, that is, the plaintiff, "appoints a director who ordinarily resides in Australia as per [section
A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s201a.html) of the Act". Since [s
AH(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ah.html) will operate upon reinstatement of the registration and says that "a person who was a director of the company immediately before the deregistration becomes a director again as from the time when ASIC or the Court reinstates the company ...", that condition will be fulfilled by the simple operation of the statutory scheme, noting that both the plaintiff and his wife, the directors at the time of deregistration, appear to be ordinarily resident in
Australia.
 I make order 1 in the originating process. The orders may be taken out forthwith.
