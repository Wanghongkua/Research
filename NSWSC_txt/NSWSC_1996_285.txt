PETER WARREN (FAIRFIELD) PTY LTD versus McMARTIN /95; CC 2595/94 July 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COURT OF APPEAL 
HANDLEY, SHELLER, BEAZLEY JJA 
CATCHWORDS: DAMAGES - whether Supreme Court action only to recover damages under [Motor Accidents Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) - whether commencement of action was an election pursuant to [s151A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151a.html) of the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) - NRMA
Insurance Limited versus NSW Grain Corp (unrep) CA 8 December 1995 
EX TEMPORE/RESERVED: Reserved 
ALLOWED/DISMISSED: Dismissed with costs 
The respondent was driving a van owned by her employer when a parcel that was not properly stacked and secured fell onto the roadway. While attempting to retrieve the parcel, she was injured and commenced proceedings in the Supreme
Court to recover damages from the appellant employer. She later claimed compensation by way of lump sum payments under Div 4 [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/index.html#p3) of the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/). The appellant argued that it was not liable to pay compensation because the respondent had made an election pursuant to [s151A(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151a.html)
Whether the respondent, by commencing proceedings in the Supreme Court, made an election depended on whether her action was only to recover damages to which [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6) of the [Motor Accidents Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) (the
Act) applied.

Judge Armitage held there was no election pursuant to the section and directed that the application for the determination of compensation proceed. The appellant argued that the respondent was also claiming damages based on the master/servant relationship, and that consequently she had made an election.

HELD: . The test to determine whether proceedings were brought to recover damages to which only [Part 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6) of the Act applied involves three separate inquiries: whether the owner or driver of the vehicle was at fault according to [s3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s3.html) of the Act; if so, whether the fault of the owner or driver caused the death of or injury to the person who has claimed; and if so, whether the fault of the owner or driver was `in the use or operation of the vehicle'.

NRMA Insurance Limited versus NSW Grain Corporation (unreported) Court of
Appeal, 8 December 1995.
Judge Armitage correctly held that the proceedings in the Supreme Court were only to recover damages to which [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6) applied so that s151A did not require the respondent to elect and the respondent had not made such an election.

ORDERS 
Leave to the appellant to appeal against the decision of the Compensation
Court of 8 June 1995.
Appeal dismissed with costs.
 
JUDGMENT 
HANDLEY JA: I agree with Sheller JA.
 
SHELLER JA: 
INTRODUCTION 
This appeal poses the question whether the respondent, a person who claimed compensation under the [Workers Compensation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) (the Act), had, by commencing proceedings in the Supreme Court to recover damages from her employer, the appellant, for the same injury, made an election which, pursuant to [s151A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s151a.html) (2) of the Act, disentitled her to compensation under Division 4 of [Part 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/index.html#p3) of the Act. The answer to this question depends upon whether the proceedings in the Supreme Court were to recover damages to which [Part 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6) of the [Motor Accidents Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) applied; see s151A (1).

In the Compensation Court the respondent claimed compensation by way of lump sum payments under Division 4 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p3) for injuries which she had sustained in a motor vehicle accident on 13 May
In an amended answer to her application the appellant denied that it was liable to pay the compensation claimed on the ground, inter alia, that the respondent had made an election pursuant to s151A to claim damages in another court. Judge Armitage in the Compensation Court was asked and agreed to decide as a preliminary point whether this defence could succeed.

SUPREME COURT PROCEEDINGS 
In the respondent's statement of claim in Supreme Court matter 18910/93 between the respondent as plaintiff and the appellant as second defendant, the pleader averred that at all material times the respondent was employed by the appellant and that the appellant by its servants and agents had loaded with parcels a certain van owned by it and to be driven by the respondent. The statement of claim, so far as relevant, continued as follows: "4. On the 13th May 1992 the Plaintiff in the course of her employment with the Second Named Defendant was driving the said van when one of the parcels because it had been inadequately stacked and positioned and secured in the van by servants and/or agents of the Second Named Defendant fell to the roadway on the F4 Freeway at or near Minchinbury and the Plaintiff in attempting to retrieve the said parcel from the roadway on the said Freeway was struck and injured by a Sigma Sedan Registration Number LDR 3132 being owned and driven by the First Named Defendant in a westerly direction upon the said freeway.
The said accident and the negligence of both Defendants and this cause is regulated under the provisions of the [Motor Accidents Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) as amended.
The Second Named Defendant owed a duty of care to ensure that all parcels within the said van were properly and adequately stacked and that the van was in a proper and safe condition to transport such parcels and materials.
In breach of its said duty the Second Named Defendant by its servants or agents failed to ensure the said van was properly packed and stacked and that all parcels were made secure within the said van knowing that the said van would be driven at speed along a Freeway and if a parcel should fall from it the Plaintiff would be required to traverse the Freeway in order to retrieve same.
The said accident was caused by negligence of both Defendants.

PARTICULARS UNDER [PART ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p16), [RULE ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s4.html) 
The Second Named Defendant by its servants or agents was negligent in that it: 
Failed to properly stack the said van; 
Failed to secure all parcels within the said van; 
Failed to warn the Plaintiff that parcels were not properly stacked and secured within the said van; 
Failed to provide a van in proper working order, condition and repair; 
Failed to provide a van that was adequate to transport the parcels required of it; 
Provided the Plaintiff with a van that was likely to lose parcels as it was driven along the F4 Freeway and lose such parcels on to the Freeway where the Plaintiff would be required to traverse in order to retrieve the same; 
Failed to give adequate warning and instruction to the Plaintiff.
 ...........
The Plaintiff claims damages.
The Plaintiff further claims interest on such verdict as is given in her favour in these proceedings at the rate of 17% per annum from the 13th May up until the date of such verdict or for such other period or rate or on such other amount as this Honourable Court shall determine." 
ELECTION 
Section 151A of the Act, so far as presently material, provides as follows: "(1) In this section ........
 `damages' does not include damages to which [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6) of the [Motor Accidents Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) applies; `permanent loss compensation' means compensation under Division 4 [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p3) (Compensation for Non-Economic Loss).

A person to whom compensation is payable under this Act in respect of an injury is not entitled to both: permanent loss compensation in respect of the injury; and damages in respect of the injury from the employer liable to pay that compensation, but is required to elect whether to claim that permanent loss compensation or those damages.

The person makes that election: by commencing proceedings in a Court to recover those damages ......." 
The language of this part of the section, prima facie, means that if a person sues to recover damages for a compensable injury which in part include damages to which [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6) applies and in part to damages to which [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6) does not apply, the "person" elects to claim damages by commencing the proceedings. Thus it can be said that in the present case the respondent's claim that she has not elected depends upon her proceedings in the Supreme
Court being to recover only damages to which [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6) applies.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s69.html) (1) of the [Motor Accidents
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/), which is found in [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6), provides: "(1) This Part applies to and in respect of an award of damages which relates to the death of or injury to a person caused by the fault of the owner or driver of a motor vehicle in the use or operation of the vehicle." "Fault" is defined in [s3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s3.html) (1) to mean "negligence or any other tort". [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s3.html) (1) contains also a definition of "motor accident" which in part mirrors the language of [s69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s69.html) . [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s3.html) (6) provides that in the Act, "a reference to the use or operation of a motor vehicle includes a reference to the maintenance or parking of the vehicle".

COMPENSATION COURT JUDGMENT 
In a careful judgment Judge Armitage posed the question he had to decide as "whether the sections of the statement of claim referred to by [counsel for the appellant] in truth claim only `damages' to which [Part 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6) of the [Motor Accidents Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) applies". His Honour added that counsel "did not argue that the circumstances in which [the respondent] alleges injury in her statement of claim did not involve a `use' of the motor vehicle within the meaning of [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s3.html) (1) and [69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s69.html) ......, although he did not formally concede that they did. Rather, as I understood his argument, he sought to establish that the injury alleged in [the respondent's] statement of claim was not alleged by her in the statement of claim to be `caused' by the fault of the owner or driver of a motor vehicle, that is [the appellant], ....... in so far as the statement of claim relates to [the appellant]." 
After citing a number of cases his Honour concluded that the respondent in commencing the proceedings was claiming "damages to which [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6) of the [Motor Accidents Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) applies", and only such damages, and that the defence pleaded failed. His Honour directed that the application for determination of compensation proceed. From this decision the appellant appealed without seeking leave. I am of opinion that the matter is of sufficient importance both generally and to the conduct of these proceedings for the grant of leave.

DAMAGES TO WHICH [PART 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6) APPLIES 
Mr King SC, who appeared for the appellant, emphasised the references in the statement of claim to the relationship of master and servant, such as paras to (g) of the particulars under [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p16), [rule ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s4.html), and submitted that as well as a claim for damages to which [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6) applied the respondent was claiming damages based on this relationship. For example, damages for negligence particularised in para (c) as "failure to warn the respondent that parcels were not properly stacked and secured within the said van" were not or might not be [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6) damages. He submitted that a proper test to apply in determining whether the statement of claim fairly raised only a claim under [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6) was to ask whether, if the respondent failed to establish some essential ingredient of a "motor accident", but nonetheless established negligence on the part of the appellant, the statement of claim would be regarded as sufficient to support an ordinary master and servant cause of action or whether a judge sitting in common law would require the statement of claim to be amended. It was said that if the matter could so proceed unamended the proper conclusion was that the respondent had, by the terms of her statement of claim, made an election to claim damages.

In NRMA Insurance Limited versus NSW Grain Corporation (unreported) Court of
Appeal, 8 December 1995, this Court considered the form of third party policy insuring a motor vehicle found in Schedule 1 of the [Motor Accidents
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/), which contained a clause whereby the insurer insured the owner of the motor vehicle "against liability in respect of the death of or injury to a person caused by the fault of the owner or driver of the vehicle in the use or operation of the vehicle in any part of the Commonwealth". Clarke JA, with whose judgment both
Priestley and Powell JJA agreed, said that the test by which it was determined whether indemnity was afforded under this clause involved three separate inquiries: "(1) Whether it has been established that the owner or driver of the vehicle is at fault - that is, to adopt the definition in [s3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s3.html), whether the evidence establishes that the owner or driver was negligent or had committed another tort? (I have adopted the definition in [s3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s3.html) because the parties agreed that this should be applied in the construction of the policy and, in my opinion, there is nothing in the text of the relevant sections of the Act or the policy which indicates a legislative intention that `fault' should have some other meaning in the policy).

If the first question is answered `Yes', whether the fault of the owner or driver caused the death of or injury to the person who has claimed? and 
If the answer to the two preceding questions is `Yes', whether the fault of the owner or driver was `in the use or operation of the vehicle' the subject of the policy?" 
This test applies to the same language used in [s69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s69.html) . Applying that test there is no doubt that the damages the respondent seeks to recover in the proceedings in the Supreme Court relate to injury to her caused by the fault of the owner of the van, namely the appellant. The only remaining question is whether the fault of the appellant was "in the use or operation of the vehicle." 
At first instance the appellant did not argue that the fault alleged in the statement of claim did not involve a "use" of the motor vehicle within the meaning of [s69](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s69.html) . On the other hand the point of Mr King's argument seems to be that negligence based upon, for example, failure to warn the respondent that the parcels were not properly stacked and secured within the van, would not be or need not be fault in the use or operation of the vehicle. The argument so framed would be attractive but for para 5 in the statement of claim where the respondent pleads that the accident and negligence of both defendants and "this cause" are regulated under the provisions of the [Motor Accidents
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/). The effect of this paragraph, in my opinion, is that one must read the fault or negligence, which the respondent has particularised and upon which her claim in the Supreme Court proceedings is based, as fault regulated by [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6), that is to say to which [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6) applies, and hence fault in the use or operation of the vehicle. By this means the pleader, who I assume was alive to the prospect that commencement of the proceedings might be an election to claim damages under s151A of the Act, has sought to limit the award of damages to damages under [Part .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6)
In my opinion the statement of claim must be so read. Accordingly I agree with
Judge Armitage that the proceedings in the Supreme Court were to recover only damages to which [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p6) applied so that s151A did not require the respondent to elect and the respondent had not made an election by commencing the proceedings.

CONCLUSION 
I propose the following orders:
Leave to the appellant to appeal against the decision of the Compensation
Court of 8 June 1995.
Appeal dismissed with costs.
 
BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Sheller J.
