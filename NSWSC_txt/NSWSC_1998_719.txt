REGINA versus WAYNE PAUL ADAMSON /98 April 1998 
Greg James J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT (On application for bail) 
HIS HONOUR: This is an application for bail. Bail is sought pending trial before the Liverpool District Court on 17 June 1988 on a charge of robbery in company. 
Tendered in support of the opposition of the Director to the application for bail is the applicant's prior record. That record is an appalling one for crimes of dishonesty, violence and crimes association with drugs. It is a record that would not dispose one to look favourably on an application for bail. These offences are offences of grave seriousness. In addition, they are offences in respect of which there is no presumption for bail.

I am informed by the applicant, who has declined to seek any adjournment to provide additional evidence of this matter and declined to give evidence himself, that he was advised to bring the application by the Prison Medical
Service since he was suffering from a brain condition arising from assaults both inside and outside the gaol system which could not adequately be treated in gaol.

I regret that I am unable to accept that as an accurate statement in the circumstances in the absence of written evidence and therefore I offered the applicant the opportunity to seek to obtain that evidence if he wished. That opportunity was declined.

In the circumstances, bail is refused.
