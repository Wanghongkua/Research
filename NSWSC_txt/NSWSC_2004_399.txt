IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION  
GZELL J  
WEDNESDAY 12 MAY 2004  /03 ROCCO TRIULCIO versus CHASE PROPERTY INVESTMENTS PTY LTD (NO 2)  
JUDGMENT  The plaintiff was successful in seeking the winding up of the defendants. He was also successful in having a cross claim dismissed. The cross claim sought an order that his shares be sold to such of the other cross defendants as wished to participate in the purchase. With one exception, the other cross defendants were directors of the defendant cross claimants. The exception was
Elias Holdings Pty Ltd.  The plaintiff sought an order for costs against the other cross defendants or, alternatively, the other cross defendants with the exception of Elias
Holdings. It was submitted that it would be unfair for an order for costs to be made against the defendants in which the plaintiff held a 45% interest.  The [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), <case> provided that subject to that Act and the rules and subject to any other Act, costs should be in the discretion of the court which should have full power to determine by whom and to what extent costs were to be paid. Such a power enables a court to visit an order for costs against a non-party (Knight versus F P
Special Assets Ltd [(1992) 174 CLR 178).]  Knight is also authority for the proposition that, to the extent to which the rules provide for the award of costs, the scope of the power in the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), <case> is reduced (see also Leicster versus Walton, unreported, CA , 22 November ).  The [Supreme Court Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/), [Pt
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p52a) r 4(2) provided, subject to exceptions irrelevant for present purposes, that the court should not in the exercise of its powers and discretions under the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), <case> make any order for costs against a person who was not a party.  The [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth), [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1335.html) provided that the costs of any proceedings before a court under that Act were to be borne by such party to the proceedings as the court, in its discretion, directed.  If the reference to any other Act in the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), <case> included an Act of the Commonwealth parliament, the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth), [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1335.html) applied. If not, the [Supreme Court Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/), [Pt
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p52a) r 4(2) applied.  In Re Wridgemont Display Homes Pty Ltd <case>; [(1992) 39 FCR 193] and in Australian Forest Managers Ltd (in liq) versus Bramley [(1996) 65 FCR 13] it was held that the forerunner of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) was another Act for the purpose of the costs power in the [Federal Court of
Australia Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fcoaa1976249/) (Cth), [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fcoaa1976249/s43.html) and that the forerunner of <case> of the former Act was mandatory.  In UTSA Pty Ltd (in liq) versus Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd <case>; [(1998) 28 ACSR 444] a different view was taken of the Victorian legislation. It was decided that any other Act for the purpose of the costs power in the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/sca1986183/) (Vic), [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/sca1986183/s24.html) applied to past legislation and, so far as future legislation was concerned, it was a question whether or not a contrary intention appeared. It was held that the forerunner of the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth), [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1335.html) did not evince a contrary intention.   It is unnecessary for me to enter upon this dispute because whether the [Supreme Court Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/), [Pt
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p52a) r 4(2) or the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth), [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1335.html) applied, the court lacked power to grant an order for costs against non- parties.  The question arises whether the cross defendants other than the plaintiff were parties to the proceedings. For this purpose, is the cross claim to be treated separately from the originating process?  Because the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/), <case> is couched in broad terms and has been held to encompass power to award costs against non-parties, any limitation on that power should, in my opinion, be construed narrowly.  Both the originating process and the cross claim were before the court and heard at the one time, no distinction being made in the evidence as to one or the other. In my view both constituted the proceedings with the consequence that the cross defendants were parties to the proceedings and neither the [Supreme Court Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/), [Pt
A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1970232/index.html#p52a) r 4(2) nor the [Corporations Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth), [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1335.html) deprived this court of power to order payment of costs by the cross defendants other than the plaintiff.  The cross defendants other than the plaintiff submitted that it was an odd result that costs could be awarded against directors if they were made parties to a cross claim but could not be awarded in the ordinary case of proceedings against their companies.  I do not find this to be an odd result. Essentially, the differences in dispute were between the directors, the plaintiff with his minority interest on the one hand and the Elias family with their majority interests on the other. Their joinder as cross defendants reflected the irretrievable breakdown in the relation between the two families that led to the proceedings.  In Morgan versus Morgan Insurance Brokers Ltd <case>; [(1993) 11 ACLC 3],126 a majority shareholder was blocked by the board of directors from transferring a share to his daughter. He claimed rectification of the register. Millett J, as he then was, held it to be a strong case for seeking an order for costs against the co-directors.  Where the real dispute was between directors, orders for costs against the unsuccessful directors rather than the company were made in, for example,
Cadwallader versus Badjco <case>; <case>  It was submitted that no warning was given prior to judgment that this type of order would be sought against the cross defendants. I adjourned the application to allow the cross defendants to consider their position. No application was made at the adjourned hearing of the application for costs to re-open to call any further evidence or to take any other course.  It was submitted that the circumstances necessitating the winding up of the defendants was the irretrievable breakdown of the relationship between the plaintiff and the Elias family and it was not held that all the circumstances arose from the conduct of the Elias family.  In my view the significant issues in the case were attributed to the conduct of the Elias family. Mr Anthony Elias was the director responsible for the provision of information from which the defendants prepared their accounts. He controlled that information to the exclusion of the plaintiff who was excluded from the financial affairs of the companies. I found no reason to doubt the evidence of Vanessa Tran that Mr Anthony Elias had taken $307,000 in cash from the seventh defendant. I found the accounts under Mr Anthony Elias' control to be unreliable in specific but significant instances as, for example, the Mangano share purchase and the Lewarne & Goldsmith accounts.
I found that the accounts were in such a state that they could not be utilised to determine the proper value of the plaintiff's shareholding and, in consequence, the compulsory purchase of the plaintiff's shares, advocated by the Elias family, was an inappropriate form of relief.  My attention was drawn to the proposition that an order for costs against a non-party will only be made in exceptional circumstances (Re Land &
Property Trust Co plc [[1991] BCC 459], Re Record
Tennis Centres Ltd [[1991] BCC 509], Re Tajic Air
Ltd [[1996] 1 BCLC 317).]  This is not a case in which the directors were non-parties. They were cross defendants. However, I accept the proposition that a court should approach with caution an application to visit costs against the directors of a company rather than the company itself. In the circumstances of this case, however, I am of the view that such an order should be made. I do not, however, see any basis for including Elias Holdings in the order.  I will order the second, third, fourth, fifth and seventh cross defendants to pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings including all reserved costs.
