EQUITY DIVISION  
BARRETT J  
MONDAY 26 NOVEMBER 2001  /01 - LUCIE NAGLER versus H VOLSKI & CO PTY LTD (IN LIQUIDATION)  
JUDGMENT  
HIS HONOUR:  The plaintiff, Mrs Nagler, seeks an order terminating the winding up of H
Volski & Co Pty Ltd. That company apparently became the subject of a members' voluntary winding up as a result of a special resolution purportedly passed at a meeting of its members held on 25 June 1998.  I was informed by Mr Neggo, when the matter came before me this morning, that the Chief Judge in Equity had on a previous occasion expressed some reservations as to whether the special resolution for winding up had been passed. The reservations arose from doubts (which I share) about the effectiveness of the proceedings at the general meeting supposedly held on 25
June 1998.  Mr Neggo has now led evidence from which I can confidently make a finding that the members of the company at the time of the supposed meeting were Mrs
Nagler herself and a company called HLP Holdings Pty Ltd. Mrs Nagler, it appears, held shares in her own right and also as the executrix of the will of her deceased first husband, Mr Volski, but, of course, that does not make her two members. One person, despite various capacities and despite holding parcels of shares in different interests, can only ever constitute a single member of a company. And this is so even if the person's name appears more than once in the register of members, with each entry signifying some different underlying capacity or shareholding account.  The doubt in my mind arises from the fact that the persons stated in the minutes to have been present at the meeting are Mrs Nagler and her second husband, Mr Nagler, the latter "representing HLP Holdings Pty Ltd". The meeting was purportedly held, as I have said, on 25 June 1998, that is, before the introduction of the provisions in [Pt
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p2g) of the Corporations Law which commenced on 1 July 1998 and are now found in [Pt
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p2g) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) 2001.  Having regard to the provisions in force at the relevant time, being those in [Pt .3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p3.3) of the Corporations Law as it then stood, a company such as HLP Holdings
Pty Ltd would properly have been regarded as capable of voting at a general meeting of another company on 25 June 1998 through the intermediation of Mr
Nagler only if he had been duly appointed as a proxy by an instrument duly lodged with the company or if he had been a representative appointed in accordance with the then s.249(3), that is to say, by resolution of the board of directors of HLP Holdings Pty Ltd. A certificate under the seal of HLP
Holdings Pty Ltd would, by virtue of s.249(6), have been prima facie evidence of such an appointment. There is not in evidence, however, anything to indicate that Mr Nagler had been appointed as a proxy in the way I described or that he had been appointed a representative under s.249(3).  There is, therefore, a substantial doubt as to whether Mr Nagler's physical presence at the supposed meeting meant that HLP Holdings Pty Ltd was properly regarded as present. There is, as a result, a further substantial doubt as to whether there was a meeting at all, given that, in its ordinary connotation, the word "meeting" denotes a plurality of persons and that this cannot be regarded as one of those odd situations where one person might constitute a meeting because there is only one person within the class of which a meeting is to be held: cf East versus Bennett Bros Ltd [[1911] 1 Ch 163]; Re
Hastings Deering Ltd [(1985) 9 ACLR 755.]  Mr Neggo has suggested to me that the situation is one which might be rectified by resort to [s.1322](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1322.html) on the footing that apparent absence of a proxy or representative appointment in favour of Mr Nagler is an irregularity capable of being cured under that section. He has told me that it appears from the material he has that Mr and
Mrs Nagler were, at the relevant time, the only directors of HLP Holdings Pty
Ltd and that they were probably also, directly and indirectly, the only persons having an interest in the share capital of that company. If this is shown to be so, it might be inferred that HLP Holdings Pty Ltd would have made a formal appointment of Mr Nagler, had the necessary machinery been put in motion, and that Mr Nagler in fact acted at the behest of the two natural persons (himself and his wife) capable of determining every action of that company - in other words, its entire guiding mind and will.  There is merit in this suggestion and it may well be that [s.1322](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1322.html) is a means of resolving the doubt which exists about the regularity and validity of the proceedings of 25 June 1998 so that the way can then be paved to proceed with the application for termination of the winding up. Another possibility, of course, is that the winding up never took place so that there is nothing to terminate.  In the circumstances, the appropriate course is that Mrs Nagler's application for an order terminating the winding up of H. Volksi & Co Pty
Ltd be stood over so that further consideration may be given to these issues and Mrs Nagler may, if she wishes to do so, pursue formally the avenue of seeking an order under [s.1322.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1322.html)  I therefore stand over this application to 9.30am on Thursday 29 November before me.
