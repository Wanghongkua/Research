CATCHWORDS: WORKERS' COMPENSATION - RELATION BETWEEN [ss 66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) & 67 OF THE [WORKERS COMPENSATION ACT 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) - DETERMINATION OF IMPAIRMENT - MARITAL DISTRESS RESULTING FROM INJURIES.

EX TEMPORE/RESERVED: Reserved 
ALLOWED/DISMISSED: Allowed 
The respondent worker was injured at the appellant's canteen and was awarded compensation under [s 66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) for 68% of a most extreme case back injury, 15% loss of efficient use of her right leg above the knee, 5% loss of efficient use of her left leg above the knee and under <case> [81](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s81.html)% of a most extreme case for pain and suffering. Medical evidence assessed the worker's impairment of her lower back at 25%, and her pain was episodic. The trial judge referred to Jones Bros Bus Co Pty Ltd versus Baker [(1992) 26 NSWLR 322] as authority for the proposition that while doctors' estimates may be useful, they regularly fail to come to grips with the legal test. The appellant contested those awards and the judge's finding that marital distress resulting from injuries should be taken into account under <case>.

HELD, allowing the appeal: (1) The awards of 68% for the back and 81% for pain and suffering were outside the available range and must be set aside; (2) Where back pain is avoided by restricting movement, the appropriate award is for impairment under [s66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html); (3) Where movements cause back pain, the award should properly be for pain and suffering under <case>; (4) Compensation should not be awarded twice for what is in substance the same pain and suffering; (5) Marital distress suffered as a result of injuries is within the proper scope of <case>.

ORDERS 
Appeal allowed with costs; 
Award under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) of $40,000 in respect of permanent impairment of the respondent's back set aside; 
Award under <case> of $40,000 in respect of pain and suffering set aside; 
Proceedings remitted to the Compensation Court for re-assessment; 
Respondent to have a Certificate under the Suitors' Fund Act.

JUDGMENT 
HANDLEY JA: This is an all grounds appeal by the employer from lump sum awards under [ss 66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) and 67 of the [Workers Compensation Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) made by Manser CCJ on 15 March 1995. His Honour made awards under [s 66](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) for permanent impairment of the worker's back based on 68% of a most extreme case, 15% loss of efficient use of her right leg at or above the knee, and a 5% loss of efficient use of her left leg at or above the knee. The award under <case> was based on 81% of a most extreme case. The awards in respect of the loss of the efficient use of the worker's legs were not challenged.

The worker was injured at the appellant's canteen on or about 29 August 1991 when she picked up a crate of milk and felt pain in her lower back. On 31
August she attended her general practitioner complaining of lower back pain.
He referred her for treatment by a chiropractor and arranged for a CT scan to be taken. The worker returned to light duties. After a short while she was forced to give up light duties. Later in the year she was referred to Dr Kwok, a neurosurgeon, and on 4 December 1991 he carried out a lumbar discectomy.
This provided some relief for the worker, but after some weeks she strained her back working at home and developed further symptoms in her right leg. By
August that year she was experiencing symptoms in her left leg as well. In
March 1993 she saw Dr Giblin as a private patient and he arranged for a further CT scan of her lumbar spine. In the meantime she had developed emotional problems, and her physical incapacities and inability to earn income caused strains in her marriage, which led ultimately to separation in January .

Many of the doctors who were qualified in this case expressed no views on the extent to which the worker's back had been impaired by the injury. The treating surgeon Dr Kwok was unable to assess "the degree of disability of pain in an objective manner" because of what he considered was a functional element. Dr Giblin stated that the worker's CT myelogram showed that her right
L5 nerve was compressed at L4/5. He reported that on 31 March 1993 "her symptoms were not severe, they being present, only episodically" and he suggested non-prescriptive analgesics or light anti-inflammatory agents and some rest. He said that on the basis of his two examinations of the worker, he was of the opinion that she was unfit for a job requiring heavy work but "may be fit for a light sedentary job in which she could change her body position at will". He considered "that she has 25 percent permanent impairment of her back".

Dr Endery-Walder, in his report of 13 January 1993, provided to the worker's solicitors stated: "Mrs Krivec claims that she has intermittent symptoms in her lower back. At times the backache is bearable and at other times it is severe enough to stop her from doing almost any physical activity. When the pain is particularly severe she has difficulty concentrating and feels emotionally drained ...
standing or sitting for any length of time or in particular walking for long distances would invariably aggravate her symptoms".

The doctor recorded that her back had been "constantly symptomatic" for the last 18 months at that stage. She was then only doing "some light duties" around the home and occasional gardening. He assessed her as having approximately 25% permanent medical impairment of her lower back directly related to her work injury. He considered that she was unfit for full time work of the kind she had been performing before her injury, but thought that she should be able to work up to four hours a day in a light duty job such as making sandwiches and serving customers in a canteen, provided she was not called upon to perform any lifting or repetitive bending.

Dr Cunningham saw the worker at the request of her solicitors on 18 June 1993.
On that occasion she complained of "constant pain in the lumbar spine of variable intensity" and intermittent radiation pain in her right and left legs. She complained that her pain was aggravated by bending or lifting, walking for more than 10 minutes, or standing for more than 15 minutes.
Examination of her thoraco-lumbar spine revealed that her movements were "fair" with the exception of forward flexion which was markedly limited and painful. The doctor thought she was unfit to return to any type of work which involved bending or lifting, and placed her "permanent physical impairment and loss of physical function of her back at 25%".

The judge considered that the worker was further up the scale of impairment than had been suggested by the doctors' estimates. He said: "This is hardly surprising because the doctors regularly fail to, or avoid, coming to grips with the legal test, which is enshrined in the statute. Clarke
JA in Jones Bros Bus Company clearly recognised the distinction ... between the medical test of impairment and the legal test of impairment. Indeed he went so far as to say that estimates of impairment by doctors were perhaps of little value. Even if that does not represent the current view of the Court of
Appeal it still remains true, it seems to me, ... that the estimates of doctors are a useful piece of evidence upon which the court can draw in satisfying the statutory test, but those estimates are not definitive of the task".

The judge then, without further reasons, found that the worker had suffered permanent impairment of her back equivalent to 68% of a most extreme case. His
Honour did not state what he understood to be "the legal test for impairment" and this Court is left to speculate as to the test he applied. Moreover, with respect, Clarke JA in Jones Bros Bus Co Pty Ltd versus Baker [(1992) 26 NSWLR ]
at 342 did not attempt to state what that test was. He said: "... I find it difficult to envisage that the expression of an opinion that there is, for instance, 25 per cent impairment of the back provides significant guidance to the Court. This is because the fixing of a percentage impairment without defining the standard against which the percentage is measured is of little, or no, assistance in determining what percentage should be awarded as reasonably proportionate to the maximum payable in a most extreme case".

The table refers simply to "permanent impairment of the back" and note (g) relevantly adds that compensation is payable only in respect of "the degree of permanent impairment". This is not technical language and it seems to me that there is no legal test as such of permanent impairment although of course note provides that in a case other than "a most extreme case" the percentage payable "shall be reasonably proportionate to "the maximum" having regard to "the severity of the matter". However I entirely accept the comments of Clarke
JA quoted above.

During the hearing I asked Mr Dodd, counsel for the worker, to indicate in what way the doctors had failed in this case to apply the legal test in giving their opinions on the degree of permanent impairment suffered by this worker.
He said that the doctors had not compared her with a most extreme case.
Instead in his submission they appeared to have compared her with a perfect back and assessed the depreciation on this basis. I am not satisfied that the doctors concerned made any such error. Note (g) requires any impairment existing before the relevant injury to be disregarded, although there had been no prior impairment of the worker's back in this case. There was in my view no legal error in assessing "the depreciation" in the worker's back because this is only a synonym for impairment. Moreover I can see no evidence on the face of the reports that the doctors failed to compare this lady with a most extreme case. The 100% against which they made their assessments may well have been taken by them as representing a most extreme case so that their percentages were an attempt to make the comparison required by the statute.

A permanent impairment of the back may reflect the degree to which movement in different directions and in different ways is inhibited either physically e.g.
because of a fusion or because of damage to the spinal cord, or because of pain. Impairment may also reflect the existence of weakness or the need to restrict or avoid particular activities because of the risk of pain or further injury. In most cases which do not involve injury to the spinal cord permanent impairment of a back will be the result of the combined effect of a number of these components. There will normally be evidence before the tribunal of fact of the practical consequences of back impairment in terms of the restrictions on the person's movements and activities, which may include the results of examinations and measurements by medical practitioners. To the extent to which that evidence is accepted it will enable the tribunal of fact to make the required comparison with a most extreme case, even if there has been no expert opinion on that question expressed as a percentage.

Where pain is avoided by restricting back movements, compensation is properly payable under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) for impairment and not under <case> for pain and suffering. Where back movements which the worker chooses to make, or cannot help making, cause pain, compensation is properly payable under <case> for pain and suffering rather than under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) for impairment. At all events compensation should not be awarded twice for what is in substance the same pain and suffering.

There is no doubt, as Dr Giblin found, that the worker had a pathological condition in her back because her right L5 nerve root was compressed at L4/5.
She had been advised to undergo further surgery for this, but had refused. The judge noted that the overwhelming body of medical opinion was that she should have further surgery, but there was no suggestion that her refusal was unreasonable.

Despite the demonstrated organic basis for her back problems, the fact remains that the extent and severity of those problems depended on her accuracy and reliability as a witness. All the doctors who expressed opinions on her back thought she was fit for some types of light work. The trial judge found in his first judgment (AB107) that she performed some housework. More importantly he found that she had exaggerated her complaints to Dr Shand and had admitted that she had exaggerated her complaints when giving evidence (AB107-8).

Unfortunately his Honour appears to have ignored these findings when making his [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) award. In the course of his reasons for his <case> award, his Honour said: "In this area, it has been urged upon me that I should also be cautious in accepting what the applicant says about herself and the effects upon her of her injury because of the admission that she made about exaggerating to Dr
Shand and to me. However, even allowing for that factor, it seems to me that the objective evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that this woman would have had, to say the least of it, a rough trot since 2 September 1991".

His Honour found that she had been "pain racked" since September 1991. He also held that he should not ignore her distress as a result of the breakdown of her marriage which, on her evidence, was the result of her injuries and her inability to undertake gainful employment. Mr Poulos QC argued that such distress could not be compensated under <case>, but I see no reason why distress suffered or likely to be suffered as a result of the effect of her injuries on her marriage should be outside the proper scope of <case>.

However, with respect to the learned trial judge, the finding that this lady had been "pain racked" fails fairly to reflect the histories recorded by a number of doctors qualified on her behalf, the results of their examinations, or the worker's own evidence. Moreover this finding appears to ignore his
Honour's earlier finding that the worker had exaggerated her complaints to Dr
Shand, and in giving evidence. How much more, one might ask, could his Honour possibly have awarded this lady if he had accepted her as a totally honest and reliable witness? In my judgment the award under <case> based on 81% of a most extreme case cannot be supported in the light of all his Honour's findings, including those of medical experts his Honour accepted. Compare Government
Supply Department versus Abbott [(1993) 9 NSW CCR 276 (CA).] In particular on 31 March 1993 Dr Giblin reported "her symptoms were not severe, they being present, only episodically".

The size of both awards strongly suggests that a significant degree of overlapping and double counting has occurred. Moreover, in my judgment, the award of 68% of a most extreme case for this worker's back impairment was also well outside the range of a sound discretionary judgment in the light of the evidence and the findings.

In my opinion the following orders should be made: 
Appeal allowed with costs; 
Award under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) of $40,000 in respect of permanent impairment of the respondent's back set aside; 
Award under <case> of $40,000 in respect of pain and suffering set aside; 
Proceedings remitted to the Compensation Court for re-assessment; 
Respondent to have a Certificate under the Suitors' Fund Act.
 
SHELLER JA: I agree with Handley JA.
 
BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Handley JA.
