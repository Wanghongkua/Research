JUDGMENT
This is an application for forfeiture orders under [s 49](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s49.html) of the [Proceeds of Crime Act 2002](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/) (Cth). The Court is required to make an order that the specified property is forfeited to the Commonwealth if the requirements of [s 49(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s49.html) are relevantly established.
In the present case there are three requirements. The first is that the Applicant for the order is a responsible authority. The Applicant, being the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, is such an authority.
The second requirement is that the restraining order has been in force for at least six months. The restraining orders were made by Hamill J on 27 July 2015. That requirement is, therefore satisfied.
The third requirement is that the Court is satisfied that the authority has taken reasonable steps to identify and notify persons with an interest in the property. There are five such persons, being, Vergara Rodriquez, Federico Gonzalez Magana, Siaki Lavaki, also known as Anthony Lione, Sisifa Tufunga and Steve Fine Lapu'aho.
I am satisfied from the affidavits of Nicole Marie Van Lent affirmed 2 September 2015, Jeffrey Aaron Kokles sworn 1 March 2016, Jody Brian Earl sworn 2 March 2016, and Trenton Schmidt affirmed 3 March 2016, that the five known persons have either been served or that the authority has taken reasonable steps to identify and to notify such persons.
No application has been made by any person to exclude property from the restraining order. In these circumstances the requirement under [s 39(1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/poca2002160/s39.html) of the Act is not required to be established.
Accordingly, I make orders in terms of paras 1 to 5 of the short minutes of order. I note that there is to be no order as to costs and that proceedings are now finalised.
