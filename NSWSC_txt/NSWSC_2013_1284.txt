JUDGMENT
In my principal judgment <case> I held that the executive committee of the owners' corporation had breached [Section 80D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ssma1996242/s80d.html) of the [Strata Schemes Management Act 1996](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ssma1996242/) by invalidly commencing these proceedings. At the hearing the first defendant adopted a limited role while the second defendant, Dr Zankin, substantially advanced the case for invalidity. He was wholly successful and now seeks to recover costs from the plaintiff in accordance with [88] of my judgment. 
Since my judgment on 19 July 2013, the plaintiff has purported to ratify its decision to commence the proceedings and now seeks the determination of additional questions arising out of that attempted ratification. It contends that an order for costs should not be made until these further questions have been resolved and the validity of the ratification has been determined. 
Application for costs on a party-party basis
There is, of course, full discretion to determine by whom, to whom and to what extent costs are to be paid: [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) [s 98(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s98.html) The proper exercise of that discretion will normally require an order that costs 'follow the event'. See [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) [Rule 42](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s42.html), Latoudis versus Casey <case>; [(1990) 170 CLR 534] An aspect of the discretion is that a court may order that costs be paid for a discrete period or stage of a proceedings.
The costs of the five-day hearing in June are clearly separable from the costs of the plaintiff's motion filed after judgment was delivered. As the second defendant was successful on all of the separate questions determined at the principal hearing, and the plaintiff failed on each of those questions, Dr Zankin has a justifiable and reasonable expectation of being awarded his costs related to that hearing. The fact that the plaintiff now seeks to agitate fresh questions, arising out of a purported ratification that occurred after judgment, is of limited discretionary significance. 
A costs order provides an important additional measure of compensation to a vindicated party who is compelled to undertake the expense of litigation to establish or defend his or her rights. In my view, the award of costs to a successful party following the hearing of separate questions represents good policy. It is not a cast-iron rule of course, and may sometimes need to be tempered by the circumstances of the particular case. But it is appropriate in this case. I repeat what I said in Ajkay versus Hickey and Co Pty Ltd  <case> at <case>: [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s98.html) of the [Civil Procedure
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) makes it clear that the Court has the power to make an order for costs at any stage of the proceedings. And the general rule is that "costs follow the event". The determination of a separate question is an "event": Loiero (aka Lero) versus Adel
Sportswear Pty Limited (No. 2)  <case> J). It matters not that the balance of the proceedings may produce a different outcome. A party that succeeds on an issue that is sufficiently significant to justify an order for separate determination, should usually have its costs of that issue - whether or not it resolves the whole proceedings: Floruit Holdings Pty Ltd versus Sebastian - Builders & Developers
Pty Ltd  <case> CJ in Eq), (Allsop P and Young JA agreeing).
For those reasons, I have concluded that, in the exercise of my discretion, that the plaintiff should pay the costs of the second defendant that were reasonably incurred in the conduct of the June hearing. This does not include the costs of the summary dismissal application made by the second defendant in March. That application was misguided and should not have been made. 
Section 229 relief
The second defendant also seeks an order pursuant to [Section 229](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ssma1996242/s229.html) of the [Strata Schemes Management Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ssma1996242/) that, in levying the contributions to pay the costs order in his favour, the owners' corporation may not levy his lots. Although I am sympathetic to the logic of this application, it does not have a sound statutory basis. [Section 229](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ssma1996242/s229.html) provides: 
Costs in proceedings by owners against owners corporation 
This section applies to proceedings brought by one or more owners of lots against an owners corporation or by an owners corporation against one or more owners of lots (including one or more owners joined in third party proceedings).

The court may order in proceedings that any money (including costs) payable by an owners corporation under an order made in the proceedings must be paid from contributions levied only in relation to such lots and in such proportions as are specified in the order.

If a court makes such an order the owners corporation must, for the purpose of paying the money ordered to be paid by it, levy contributions in accordance with the terms of the order and must pay the money out of contributions paid in accordance with that levy.
[Section 229](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ssma1996242/s229.html) does not give the Court a general power. It is limited to proceedings 'brought' by an owners corporation against a lot owner, and vice versa. When these proceedings were commenced, they were brought by the owners corporation against a building company and no one else. Dr Zankin was not originally a party to the proceedings.
Somewhat irregularly, he sought to participate in the proceedings by filing a notice or motion (as a non-party) seeking an order that the plaintiff's claim be summarily dismissed. At the hearing of his notice of motion, I made clear that it was misguided and that his objective would be better served if I directed that he be joined as the second defendant and that certain questions be fixed for final hearing. This provided a more satisfactory jurisdictional platform for the advancement of his contentions. 
In the result, Dr Zankin was joined in the proceedings as a result of an order of the court made almost two years after the commencement of the proceedings. He was not joined by the owners corporation. These circumstances make it clear why this is not a case that falls within the scope of [Section 229](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ssma1996242/s229.html) - from both a literal and purposive perspective. They were not 'brought' by the owners corporation against a lot owner. The joinder of Dr Zankin was not the result of an exercise of choice made by the plaintiff. It is therefore inappropriate to make an order for relief under [Section 229.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ssma1996242/s229.html) 
Orders
I order the plaintiff to pay the second defendant's costs of and incidental to the hearing that commenced on 13 June 2013, excluding any costs of the second defendant associated with his application for summary dismissal.
