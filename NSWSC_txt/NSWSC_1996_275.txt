JUDGE1
HUNT
CJ at CL This is a case stated by Judge Madgwick QC of the District
Court pursuant to [s 5B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act 1912](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/), submitting for the determination of this Court a number of questions of law which arose out of an appeal to the District Court from the Local Court.
Before turning to those questions and to the various issues raised in argument, it is necessary to state in some detail the progress of the matter from its inception. Much of what follows comes from documents or information provided to this
Court by consent rather than from the Stated Case. ((1) cf
Thomas versus King <case>; [(1937) 59 CLR 279] at ; Regina versus Alexander William Madden (CCA, 15 December 1995, unreported) at
Some of the information sought from the Comptroller-General took months to be supplied.) 
On 20 February 1992, informations were laid alleging two breaches by the defendant D'Aquino Bros
Pty Ltd of [s 33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html) of the [Customs Act 1901](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) and one breach of [s 61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s61.html) of the [Excise Act 1901](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/). ((2) I shall refer to D'Aquino Bros Pty Ltd as the defendant or the defendant company, as the context requires.) The information in each case asserts that the person who appeared before the justice was "The Comptroller-General of Customs by Wendy Irene Honey an officer of Customs duly delegated by the said Comptroller-General to institute this Customs (or Excise) Prosecution in the name of the said
Comptroller-General of Customs". The defendant was summonsed to appear at the
Local Court at Orange. The summonses in each case also referred to the prosecution as a "Customs (or Excise) Prosecution". [Section 33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) provides: "(1) Except as authorized by this Act, a person shall not move, alter or interfere with goods that are subject to the control of the Customs.
Penalty: $50,000." 
If a person who commits an offence against sub-section (1) does the act that constitutes the offence: on behalf of another person of whom he is an employee at the direction or with the consent or agreement (whether express or implied) of another person; that other person commits an offence and is punishable, on conviction, by a fine not exceeding $50,000." [Section 61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s61.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) provides: "All excisable goods are, until delivered for home consumption or for exportation to a place outside Australia, whichever first occurs, subject to the control of Customs and must not be moved, altered or interfered with except as authorized by this Act.
Penalty: $20,000." 
The defendant company, by its employees, was alleged to have watered down
Bourbon whisky from vats under bond in its Orange warehouse and bottled it (almost 2000 cases of 750 ml bottles), to have bottled brandy from a vat similarly under bond (almost 1000 cases of 750 ml bottles), and to have delivered them to a customer or customers, without (as required) first having entered the liquor in the company's bond records, lodged a clearance entry and paid duty. The total amount of duty and excise payable was $439,594.04. This amount was subsequently paid on demand. 
The informations were based upon both [s 33(l)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s33.html) and [s 33(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html) of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/), and [s 61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s61.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/). In order (apparently) to avoid complaints of duplicity, amended informations were laid during the course of the hearing in the Local
Court. The amended informations - three under the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) and two under the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) ((3) It is agreed between the parties that the Stated
Case is wrong in its references to there being still only two charges under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) and only one charge under [s 61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s61.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) when the magistrate came to deal with the matter) - were laid with the name "Michael Joseph Drury" substituted for the name "Wendy
Irene Honey" as the officer to whom the delegation had been made, but the informations otherwise remained (so far as is here relevant) in the same form.
In accordance with [s 78(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s78.html) of the [Justices Act 1902](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), the defendant company admitted the truth of the informations relating to all five charges and, on 9 September 1992, the magistrate found the charges proved but dismissed them without proceeding to conviction, in accordance with [s 19B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/s19b.html) of the [Crimes Act 1914](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/) (Cwth). Like charges against two employees of the defendant company (members of the D'Aquino family), to which pleas of guilty were entered, resulted in convictions being recorded and what are said to have been fines and penalties were imposed totalling $11,500.
((4) I interpret [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) as prescribing a fine as the punishment for the offence committed by "that other person"- that is, the person on behalf of whom an employee commits the offence created by [s 33(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html) - not the employee.
The point was, however, not argued before us in relation to the two employees.) 
On 30 September 1992, a document purporting to be a Notice of Appeal to the District Court (Criminal Jurisdiction) was lodged. The appellant is named as "Australian Customs Service (Informant)", the offence is said to have been "[s 33(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html) [Customs Act 1901](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) (3 Counts) (move goods under control of customs)" and the Notice asserts that the "date of conviction" was 9 September 1992. The ground of appeal is stated as follows: "The penalty imposed is inadequate (appeal lodged pursuant to [s 248](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s248.html) [Customs Act 1901](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/))." 
It is signed "Australian Government Solicitor, per George W Turnbull (Mr
Clugston)". The respondent to the appeal is not named.
A Notification of
Appeal to the District Court (Criminal Jurisdiction) was issued by the Local
Court on 2 October which nominates the defendant company as the respondent.
This document otherwise had the same particulars as the Notice of Appeal. It was forwarded to the defendant company by the Clerk of the Local Court on 6
October 1992. 
The appeal finally came on for hearing in the District
Court on 3 August
An objection to the competency of this appeal was overruled by Judge
Madgwick, who granted leave to amend the Notice of Appeal by substituting the "Comptroller-General of Customs" for the "Australian Customs Service" as appellant and by adding a reference to one charge based upon a breach of [s 61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s61.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/). The Comptroller-General has been unable to identify which of the two charges under that section of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) was the subject of that leave. ((5) Since the recent further hearing, the Comptroller-General has now suggested that it is unclear whether the judge granted leave to amend the
Notice of Appeal to include one or both prosecutions under the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/), but he remains unable - despite extensive inquiries - to resolve the issue. If the
Comptroller-General cannot resolve the issue, and he is the appellant, nor can this Court.) 
After hearing the appeal on its merits, the judge held that, although the appeal was by way of a hearing de novo, he was obliged to exercise appellate restraint in what was in substance a prosecutor's appeal against inadequacy of penalty. He indicated that he did not propose to change the orders which the magistrate had made. 
However, at the request of the Comptroller-General, he stated a Case for the determination of this Court.
The argument in this Court ranged for beyond the questions which were submitted to it for its determination, and included a challenge to this
Court's jurisdiction to hear the Stated Case. It is preferable that I deal with the issues raised in that argument before identifying the questions and stating the answers which I propose to those questions.
The first issue was as to the true nature of the proceedings brought in the Local Court. The relevant enforcement procedures under both the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) and the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) have a long - and, at times, confused - history. Their antiquity has led to some ambiguity in their true nature. It is conceded that there is no significant distinction between the procedures laid down by each of those Acts so far as this appeal is concerned. The punishment for breaches of the statutes was originally a penal debt to the Crown, for which the enforcement (as with all debts) was imprisonment until the debt was paid, and the procedure was by way of a quasi-civil action in the Court of Exchequer.
This procedure - now abolished in England - was adopted in New South Wales in the early 1830's, and was carried forward into the Commonwealth [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) and [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) upon Federation. The history is briefly traced by Else Mitchell
J in Collection of Customs versus Rieken. ((6) (1964) 81 WN [(Pt 1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s1.html) 483 at 491-493.)
In 1992, the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended that the procedures be simplified and the anomalies removed.
((7) "Customs and Excise " ALRC 60,
Chapter 14.) That recommendation is yet to be accepted by the Federal
Government.
The present position is that breaches of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) may be prosecuted either as ordinary criminal offences or by way of a procedure of "a somewhat peculiar character" called a customs prosecution. ((8) Mallan versus Lee <case>; [(1949) 80
CLR 198] at 206.) A customs prosecution is defined by [s 244](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s244.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) as "(p)roceedings by the Customs for the recovery of penalties other than a pecuniary penalty referred to in [s 243B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s243b.html) under this Act". [Section 243B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s243b.html) permits the Minister, the Commissioner of Police, the Comptroller-General or the
Director of Public Prosecutions to commence proceedings in the Federal Court for an order that a person pay a "pecuniary penalty" to the Commonwealth in respect of prescribed narcotics dealings in which that person has been engaged. ((9) Such dealings are defined by [s 243A(3).)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s243a.html) It is inapplicable here. An excise prosecution is similarly defined by [s 133](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s133.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) as "(p)roceedings by the Customs for the recovery of penalties under any [Excise
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/)".
[Section 61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s61.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) alleged to have been breached in the present case provides for a penalty, rather than a fine or imprisonment, to be imposed for a breach. Prima facie, at least, the intention of Parliament would appear to be that breaches of that section should be enforced by an excise prosecution. The choice - where there is a choice - is that of the prosecution. ((10) "Customs and Excise Law", EJ Cooper,par l02.) [Section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/), on the other hand, does not provide for a penalty in the same way. In contrast to [s 33(l)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html), which does provide for a penalty in the same way as [s 61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s61.html), [s 33(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html) provides that the punishment for the offence on conviction is a fine not exceeding $50,000. There is no similar indication, prima facie or otherwise, that breaches of that section should be a customs prosecution. It was nevertheless argued by the Comptroller-General that the reference to "(p)roceedings ... for the recovery of penalties" in the definition of a customs prosecution in [s 244](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s244.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) should be read broadly to include both penalties and fines. It was argued by the
Comptroller-General that these were in every sense customs prosecutions in the present case. Each information is internally described as a "Customs
Prosecution" in the passage I quoted earlier, as it is also in each Summons.
It will be necessary to deal more fully later in this judgment with the various incidents of a customs (or excise) prosecution. It is sufficient at this stage to draw attention only to the incidents which distinguish it most from an ordinary criminal prosecution. For convenience, I will refer here only to the incidents of a customs prosecution. The prosecution may be commenced in the Supreme Court as well as in any court of summary jurisdiction (Customs
Act, [s 245)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s245.html), and the procedure to be applied is the ordinary procedures of that Court in civil cases [(s 247).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s247.html) It nevertheless leads to a conviction.((11)
Evans versus Button [(1988) 13 NSWLR 57] at 646.) This is expressly stated in [s 33(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html), and applies also to [s 33(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html), because [s 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s5.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) provides that, where a penalty is set out at the foot of a subsection (as [s 33(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html) does), a contravention of that statutory provision is an offence against that Act punishable on conviction by a penalty. The Comptroller-General may aver facts in the originating process of a customs prosecution, and such averments become prima facie evidence of the facts averred [(s 255).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s255.html) The Comptroller-General may appeal against the dismissal of the proceedings [(s 248).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s248.html) It has never been determined authoritatively (that is, at a level higher than a first instance judge) as to whether the onus of proof is to be discharged in accordance with the criminal or the civil standard, although the preponderant view is that it is the civil standard. ((12) The decisions are helpfully discussed by
Carruthers J in Button versus Evans [(1994) 2 NSWLR 338] at 349-353, who ruled that it is the civil standard of proof which applies, at least in proceedings in the Supreme Court.) 
Reliance was placed by the Comptroller-General upon the description of a fine, given by Lord Goddard CJ in Treasury versus Harris, ((13) [(1957) 2 QB 516] at ) as "a monetary penalty ... which is due to the Crown ... (for which) there at once arises a debt of record to the Crown".
That statement, in my view, is against the Comptroller-General's argument, as by [s 264](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s264.html) "all penalties ... recovered under the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/)" become the property of the
Comptroller-General, whereas fines must necessarily be paid to tile Crown.
((14) Brown versus Allweather
Mechanical Grouting Co Ltd [(1954) 2 QB 443] at 446.)
It is clear that a customs prosecution is to recover the penalty so that it becomes the property of the Comptroller-General, not a debt payable to the
Crown.
Reliance was also placed by the Comptroller-General upon the interchangeable use of the words "fine" and "penalty" by the joint majority judgment in Byrne versus McLeod, ((15) <case>; [(1934) 52 CLR 1] at 5) where the High Court was considering <case> of the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No 1) 1930 which provided only for a penalty. The point now in issue did not arise in that case, and the apparent looseness of expression by the members of the High
Court could hardly provide a proper basis for adopting a looseness of interpretation of a statutory provision.
Reliance was also placed by the
Comptroller-General upon what was said by
Latham CJ in Mallan versus Lee, ((16) <case>; [(1949) 80 CLR 198] at 204-5, 208) when considering whether proceedings to recover a penalty pursuant to <case> of the [Income Tax Assessment Act 1936](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) had been commenced within time. He referred to the penalty provided as a fine. The offence created by <case>, however, was one which, by ss 247-248, permitted the court convicting a person for that offence to commit the offender to gaol until the penalty is paid.
I do not obtain any assistance from the description given by the Chief Justice to the penalty provided in that section.
Finally, reliance was placed by the Comptroller-General upon the legislative history of <case>. The original section in the 1901 Act was to a
similar effect to what is now subs (1) of that section. The original penalty of E I 00 was converted to $200 by Act 28 of 1966 and then increased to $1000 by Act 54 of 1967. A minor amendment was made to the wording by Act 104 of
Then, by Act 64 of 1981, s 33 was repealed and replaced by a new section in the form in which it presently stands (except for subs (5), which was added by
Act 51 of 1982). The provision of a penalty for subs (1) was retained, but subs (2) - in contrast to subs (1) - provides for a fine.
The penalty provided by subs (1) was increased to $50,000 by Act 81 of 1982.
The Comptroller-General drew attention to the
Explanatory Memorandum and to the Minister's Second Reading Speech in support of the Bill for Act 64 of by which <case> was repealed and replaced. The only thing said of the alteration was that, because the previous offence was too limited in its terms, a liability was to be placed upon the principal of a person who committed that offence, subject to a defence that due preventive care and diligence had been exercised by the principal. The argument here is that the absence of any reference to the contrast between the two subsections means that the contrast was not deliberate. Indeed, the submission was made that the drafting of the new <case> had been per incuriam.
An acceptance of the Comptroller-General's argument that the definition of a customs prosecution in <case> should be read broadly to include proceedings for the recovery of fines could lead to extraordinary consequences in relation to other offences for which fines and/or imprisonment are provided as punishment. Proceedings to recover pecuniary penalties for "prescribed narcotics dealing" ((17) A prescribed narcotics dealing is defined in s
A(3). The definition would appear to include the special provisions concerning narcotics goods contained in <case> of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/)) are excluded by the definition of a customs prosecution in [s 244](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s244.html), but the right to conduct any prosecution for the recovery of a fine by way of a customs prosecution would seriously erode the defendant's constitutional right to a trial by jury enshrined in [s 80](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s80.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). ((18) See also Evans v
Lynch (1984) 3 NSW 567.)
There is some justification by way of commercial necessity for the special procedure permitted in customs prosecutions, but that fact does not, in my view, justify extending customs prosecutions beyond their expressly stated limits by giving <case> the broad interpretation for which the
Comptroller-General contends. An issue which arises later in this judgment relating to whether the prosecutions were correctly commenced discusses the lack of clarity in the way in which different parliaments have dealt with the distinction between informations and complaints, and how in some cases the use of the word ".complaints" rather than "information" in a statute has been held to be non-technical. There has for some time been a move to overcome the crippling of the criminal law by procedural technicalities. ((19) See, for example, Regina versus Saffron (1988) 17 NSW at 445-449; CAC versus Bain [(1991) 55 A
Crim R 73] at 78.) There is everything to be said for such a move, accompanied as it is by an insistence upon the absence of prejudice to the accused (or the defendant) when a departure is permitted. But it is going a very long distance further to hold that the same approach should be taken which would permit the
Comptroller-General to proceed by way of customs prosecution in relation to the recovery of fines (which go to the Crown) as well as the recovery of penalties (which go to the Comptroller-General), with the extraordinary consequences that such a prosecution has.
I reject the Comptroller-General's argument that [s 244](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s244.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) should be interpreted so that a customs prosecution may be brought to include proceedings to recover both penalties and fines. The prosecutions based upon [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) were, accordingly, not customs prosecutions within the meaning of [s 244](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s244.html) of that Act. On the other hand, the prosecutions based upon [s 61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s61.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) clearly were excise prosecutions within the meaning of [s 133](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s133.html) of that Act. It has not been suggested otherwise, nor could it have been.
The precise identification of the informations which were dealt with by the magistrate was not made - and the point that the prosecutions were not customs prosecutions was not taken - until well after argument in the appeal had concluded. ((20) The further informations laid in the Local Court were, of course, that Court's own documents. The defendant was not made aware of their contents although, of course, its legal representatives were fully aware that the prosecutions under the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) were, finally, pursuant to [s 33(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html)
Fresh summonses were unnecessary because the defendant was already before that
Court: Ex parts Walker, re Goodfellow (1944) 45 SR at 106-108 (SLAR [(1945) CLR 640)] The appeal had proceeded upon the assumption (at least by the members of this Court) that the defendant had finally been charged pursuant to [s 33(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html), not [s 33(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html), of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/), so that there was no real issue that the prosecutions had in fact been customs prosecutions. This was certainly the impression conveyed by the Stated Case. Nothing to the contrary was said by either party during the hearing or in their written submissions. Those written submissions received after that hearing (pursuant to leave reserved), and relating to a different issue, included a copy of at least one information against the defendant in which the offence was identified as one under [s (2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html) The parties were then requested to identify the relevant informations with some precision.
Pursuant to [s 12(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s12.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/), the Court then remitted to me, sitting in the Supreme Court (as a court of trial), the determination of the issues as to, inter alia, the sections or subsections of the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) under which the prosecutions were brought. Agreement was reached before me that, finally, all prosecutions under the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) were brought pursuant to [s 33(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html), and that there were three of them, and that there were two prosecutions under [s 61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s61.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/). Further submissions were then made, orally and in writing, and it was agreed between the parties that a transcript of the oral submissions made before me should be treated as written submissions to the whole Court.
The consequence of my decision that the prosecutions under the [Customs
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) were not customs prosecutions is that no appeal pursuant to [s 247](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s247.html) of that
Act lay to the District Court from the dismissal of the charges in the Local
Court. (The defendant's admission of the truth of the informations pursuant to [s 78(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s78.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) overcomes any problem which may otherwise have arisen in relation to the Comptroller-General's reliance upon the averments, in those informations.) There was no other statutory form of appeal possible from the dismissal of the charges, ((21) The Comptroller-General does not obtain the benefit of the appeal against sentence permitted to the State
Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to ss
AA-131AC of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), to which reference is made later in this judgment) and thus the common law principle applied that no person shall be twice put in jeopardy for the one and the same offence. ((22) Davern versus Messel <case>; [(1984) 155 CLR 21] at 299. See also
Collector of Customs versus Tallerman and Co Pty Ltd (1975) 2 NSWLR 832.) The appeals by the Comptroller-General to the
District Court against the dismissal of these prosecutions under the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) should therefore have been dismissed as incompetent.
That decision also means that, from a practical point of view, it is strictly unnecessary for this Court to determine any of the other issues raised in argument in relation to the prosecutions under the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/). Each of those issues remain (for the time being) to be determined in relation to the excise prosecutions. They were all fully argued in relation to both customs and excise prosecutions, and it was emphasized during the course of the hearing that these were issues of important relevance to other pending prosecutions. I propose, therefore, to deal with those issues in relation to both customs prosecutions and excise prosecutions as if the appeal continued to relate to both.
The next issue raised in argument was as to the true nature of the breaches alleged in informations laid and upon which the summonses were based.
I have already set out the terms of [s 33(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/). They expressly provide that a breach of its provisions constitutes an offence which is punishable on conviction by a fine. Assuming that the customs prosecution was based rather upon [s 33(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html), again I have already set out the terms of that subsection and of [s 61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s61.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/). Neither section provides expressly that a breach of its provisions constitutes an offence; it simply provides for a liability to a penalty.
There is a line of authority in England that, where the only consequence nominated for the breach of a statutory provision is the liability to a penalty, no offence is created: AG versus Bradlaugh ((23) [(1885) 14 QBD 667] at .) That has been followed both in England (even where the statutory provision refers to an offence) ((24) Brown versus Allweather
Mechanical Grouting
Co Ltd (446-448)) and in Australia. ((25) Chinchen versus Weiss [(1963) 80 WN 1676] at 195-196.) In Mallan versus Lee, ((26) (at 206-207)) a case concerned with the analogous taxation prosecution procedure, ((27) [Income Tax Assessment Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/itaa1936240/) s ) Latham CJ found it unnecessary to determine the nature of the proceedings to which such a prosecution relates. However, both the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) [(s 5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s5.html) and the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) [(s 5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s5.html) provide that, where a penalty is set out or referred to at the foot of a section or sub-section, it indicates that any contravention of the statutory provision, whether by act or omission, is an offence against that Act punishable on conviction by a penalty. These two provisions must be contrasted to a like provision of general application in [s 4D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/s4d.html) of the [Crimes
Act 1914](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/), which applies only "(e)xcept so far as the contrary intention appears". The apparently careful omission in both statutory provisions here relevant to state expressly that a breach (or contravention) of them upon which the customs or excise prosecutions were based constitutes an offence cannot therefore be interpreted as excluding those breaches as offences. I am satisfied that breaches of s (1) and of <case> do constitute offences punishable on conviction by a penalty. As I have already stated, <case> expressly provides that a breach constitutes an offence punishable on conviction by a fine.
Before dealing with the next issue raised, it is necessary to refer in the one place to a number of provisions in the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) concerning such customs and excise prosecutions. Customs prosecutions may be instituted by the
Comptroller-General "in the name of the office of the (Comptroller-General) by action, information or other appropriate proceeding in the Supreme Court of a
State ...
or in a court of summary jurisdiction of a State" [(s 245).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s245.html) Every such prosecution in those courts "may be commenced prosecuted and proceeded with in accordance with any rules of practice (if any) established by the
Court for Crown suits in revenue matters or in accordance with the usual practice and procedures of the Court in civil cases or in accordance with the directions of the Court or a judge" [(s 247).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s247.html) [Section 248](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s248.html) provides that, subject to the provisions of that Act: "...the provisions of the law relating to summary proceedings in force in the State or Territory where the proceedings are instituted shall apply to all Customs prosecutions before a Court of summary jurisdiction in a State or Territory, and an appeal shall lie from any conviction order for condemnation or order of dismissal to the Court and in the manner provided by the law of the State or Territory where such conviction or. order is made for appeals from convictions or orders of dismissal, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the law of the
State or Territory, an appeal shall lie from an order of dismissal to any court to which and in the manner in which an appeal lies from a conviction. " [Section 251](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s251.html) deals with the amendments of any defects in the originating process: "No objection shall be taken or allowed to any information, summons or other originating process for any alleged defect therein in substance or in form or for any variance between such information, summons or other originating process and the evidence adduced at the hearing in support thereof, and the Court shall at all times make any amendment necessary to determine the real question in dispute or which may appear desirable, and if any such defect or variance shall appear to the Court to be such that the defendant has been thereby deceived or misled it shall be lawful for the
Court upon such terms as it may think just to adjourn the hearing of the case to some future day."
The requirements of [s 134](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s134.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) as to an excise prosecution by the Comptroller-General of Customs in the name of his office by action, information or other appropriate proceedings are largely identical to the provisions of [s 245](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s245.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) to which I have referred. The requirements of [s 136](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s136.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) as to the rules of practice in accordance with which the excise prosecution is to be commenced, prosecuted and proceeded with are similarly largely identical to those of [s 247](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s247.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/), as are those of [s 137](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s137.html) as to the application of the provisions of the law relating to summary proceedings to [s 248](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s248.html) and those of <case> as to defects in the originating process to [s 251](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s251.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/). I have already noted the concession that there is no significant distinction between the two procedures so far as this appeal is concerned.
The third issue raised in argument was as to whether the customs and excise prosecutions were correctly commenced.
((28) Again, I have dealt with this issue upon the basis that the prosecutions under the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) were indeed customs prosecutions within the meaning of [s 244](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s244.html) of that Act, notwithstanding my decision that they were not.) There are in reality two issues involved here. Was the correct originating process used? And was it instituted in the name of the office of the Comptroller-General? I will deal with each separately.
 .
As already stated, [s 245](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s245.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) (as does [s 134](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s134.html) of the [Excise
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/)) says that a customs or excise prosecution may be instituted "by action, information or other appropriate proceeding ... in a court of summary jurisdiction of a State", and <case> says that the prosecution may be commenced and proceeded with in accordance with "any rules of practice (if any) established by the Court for Crown suits in revenue matters or in accordance with the usual practice and procedures of the Court in civil cases" or in accordance with directions given in relation to the particular case. The Local
Court of New South Wales is such a court of summary jurisdiction so far as its jurisdiction under the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) (inherited from the Courts of Petty
Sessions) ((29) [Local Courts Act 1982](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lca1982149/), [s 7(1).)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lca1982149/s7.html) concerns the trial of offences punishable on summary conviction, of complaints and of indictable offences dealt with summarily. ((30) [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), [Pt 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/index.html#p4), Div 1 Subdiv 10 and Div 2.)
The Local Court does not sit as a court of summary jurisdiction (as that expression is defined and generally understood ((31 The [Acts Interpretation
Act 1901](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aia1901230/), by <case>(d), defines a court of summary jurisdiction as, inter alia, "any ... magistrate of ... a State .... sitting as a court for the making of summary orders or the summary punishment of offences under the law of the
Commonwealth ... or under the law of the
State...".)) in relation to the remainder of its jurisdiction under the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) or at all under the [Local
Courts (Civil Claims) Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lcca1970250/). In common with all the other courts of this
State, the Local Court has no rules of practice established for "Crown suits in revenue matters". ((32) Evans versus Lynch (at 569).)
I do not interpret either <case> or <case>, by its specific reference to an information, as permitting a customs or excise prosecution to be commenced by information where that is not otherwise an appropriate proceeding in the relevant court In which it is commenced. This, it seems to me, necessarily follows from the context "or other appropriate proceeding" (emphasis added) in which the reference to information is found in that section. The usual civil practice and procedures to which [s 247](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s247.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) and [s 137](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s137.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) refer are non-existent in the Local Court where it sits as a court of summary jurisdiction. The ordinary procedures by which a civil action for debt may be commenced in the Local Court by way of Statement of Claim ((33) [Local Courts (Civil Claims) Rules 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedreg/lccr1988299/), made pursuant to [s 84](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lcca1970250/s84.html) of the [Local
Courts (Civil Claims) Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lcca1970250/), [Pt 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lcca1970250/index.html#p5) r 1. See also [s 22.)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lcca1970250/s22.html) cannot therefore, be used.
The procedures provided by the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) for the disposal of its jurisdiction when sitting as a court of summary jurisdiction are limited to informations and complaints.
[Section 52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s52.html) says that an information "may be laid ... in any case where any person has committed or is suspected to have committed an offence for which he is liable upon summary conviction ... to be punished by fine, imprisonment, or otherwise". [Section 53](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s53.html) says that a complaint "may be made ... in any case where a Justice or Justices has or have authority by law to make an order for the payment of money, or otherwise".
Parliaments have not always dealt with that distinction with clarity, ((34)
Regina versus Nottingham
Justices; Ex parte Brown [(1960) 1 WLR 1315] at 712;
Minister for Industry and Commerce versus Tooheys Ltd <case>; [(1982) 42 ALR 260] at 393.) a problem that has already become apparent in relation to [s 33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/). Such has been the measure of confusion in England, for example, that the Parliament there was obliged to provide that, where an offence is to be dealt with, all references to a complaint as an initiating process are to be replaced by a reference to an information.
((35) Magistrates Courts Act 1952, <case>. See Northern Ireland
Traders Ltd versus Preston Corp [(1972) 1 WLR 203] at 206.)
In Jones versus Metcalf, ((36) [(1979) 2 NSWLR 709.)] Yeldham J was concerned with proceedings in the Local Court in which it was alleged that the defendant had been guilty of a breach of a rule prescribed by <case> of the Coal Mines
Regulation Act 1912, which did not itself provide for the consequences of such a breach.
Section 56 provided that any person who contravened or did not comply with such a rule was guilty of an offence against that Act.
That section did not go on to provide, as do the statutory provisions relevant here, that such offence is punishable on conviction by a penalty. It appears to have been assumed that only a fine could be imposed. Section 70(b) provided that the Courts of Petty
Sessions had jurisdiction "to hear and determine complaints for breaches of this Act punishable by fine" (emphasis added). The judge held that the use of the word "complaints" in <case>(b) was a non-technical one, and that the magistrate had been wrong to say that he had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the proceedings because they had been commenced by way of informations. That case refers to many instances where
Parliaments have confused the two concepts. Although both parties to the present appeal relied upon the judgment of Yeldham J in one way or another to support their arguments, I do not (with respect) believe that it assists the resolution of the present appeal other than by way of an historical background to the distinction between informations and complaints, and its description of a complaint as ordinarily a process which initiates summary proceedings of a civil, rather than a criminal, nature.
((37) See also Regina versus Hull (at 393).)
Such a distinction is an uncomfortable one in relation to the present customs and excise prosecutions which, as I have pointed out, are based upon offences created by the breaches of the statutory provisions which are punishable on conviction by a penalty. Some comfort could perhaps be obtained by an adoption of a description of these offences as "civil offences", a phrase apparently coined by Murphy J in Li Chia Hsing versus Rankin, ((38 <case>; [(1978) CLR 182] at 201.) although I do not (with respect) believe that the authorities to which he refers support its validity. In the field of industrial law in Australia, where a breach of an industrial award is committed various courts may impose a penalty in relation to such a breach.
((39) Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, <case>) It was held by the Federal
Court, in Gapes versus Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd, ((40) <case>; [(1979) 27 ALR 87.)] that proceedings for the imposition of such a penalty were not criminal in nature, so that an appeal to the Full Court from the dismissal of such proceedings by a single judge of that Court remained available. In contrast with various other provisions in that Act in which a penalty is set out at the foot of the section (thereby indicating that a contravention of the section is an offence against the Act, punishable upon conviction by a penalty ((41) [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/), [s 4D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/s4d.html), previously the Acts Interpretation Ad 1901, [s 41.))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/s41.html), <case> does not state what the penalty is to be in that form. A breach of an award is thus not punishable on conviction. ((42) For the same reason, the NZ decision in Osborne versus Robertson <case>; [(1985) 2 NZLR 680] and the recent decision of the Full
Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in Re Packington; Ex parte
Executive Director
Building Management Authority (2 February 1996, unreported) are of no assistance upon this issue.) There were also many other matters which the Federal Court took into account as strongly indicating a legislative intention that such a breach is not a criminal offence.
The situation here is that a breach of the relevant section is an offence punishable on conviction.
In England - where a breach of the provisions in the revenue statutes also does not amount to an offence punishable on conviction by a penalty - the penalty imposed has often been called a civil debt. ((43) See, for example,
Anonymous [(1793) 1 Anst 205] at 850).) That is not the situation here.
These offences are offences against the public law, punishable on conviction. ((44)
Evans versus Button (at 74); Jack Brabham Holdings Pty Ltd versus The
Minister (at 646).) I do not accept that any such offence punishable on conviction can properly be called a civil offence. I maintain the view which I have previously expressed that a customs prosecution is a proceeding in relation to a criminal offence and thus of a criminal nature. ((45) Moore v
Jack Brabham Holdings Pty Ltd (1987) NSWLR 470 at 482.) The only qualification which has been suggested is that a customs prosecution in the
Supreme Court (to which this Court's civil practice and procedure applies pursuant to <case>) should more properly be described as a "hybrid" ((46) Jack
Brabham
Holdings Pty Ltd versus The Minister (at 652).) - although even then it was said to be still "quasi-criminal" and "much more closely akin to criminal proceedings, properly so called, than to purely civil litigation between parties". ((47) Ibid (at 653). Kirby P said (at 650) that I had been correct in the view which I had expressed (as stated in the text), although I had been incorrect as to the test to be applied in an application for a stay of such proceedings for abuse of process. The other two judges found it unnecessary to express any opinion upon the issue. See also Second Life Decor Pty Ltd v
Customs <case>; [(1994) 53 FCR 78] at 94.) In England - again, where the offence involved was not one punishable on conviction - the proceedings to recover a penalty for such an offence have been described as "quasi-criminal". ((48) AG v Bradlaugh (at 694).)
In its Discussion Paper relating to its Customs and Excise reference dealing with customs prosecutions, jurisdiction and administrative penalties, ((49) DP 42 (April ).) the Australian Law Reform Commission said ((50) (at par 30).) that customs prosecutions brought in courts of summary jurisdiction are treated as criminal cases and in the same way as ordinary criminal prosecutions, which it said was the accepted view but which was nevertheless of doubtful validity. I agree. Common error - if common error there has in fact been - does not validate a practice which is not in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions. Not even the mystique surrounding these "peculiar" procedures for the recovery of penalties for revenue offences can save the procedure where it does not comply with those statutory provisions.
I return then to the provisions of [ss 52](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s52.html)-[53](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s53.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) as to the appropriate originating process for the prosecutions in the present case.
Although each of the sections is couched in the permissive form "may" (I earlier quoted their terms), that does not permit the use of either an information or a complaint freely in the alternative without regard to whether such use is appropriate in the particular case. Neither the laying of an information nor the issue of a summons is essential in every case to the jurisdiction of the justice or justices hearing the matter. ((51) Ex parte
Walker, Re Goodfellow (at 106-108); Ex parte Findlay; Re James (at 177).) That is clearly the reason for the use of the permissive "may" rather than the mandatory "shall" in the two sections.
There could be no doubt that the making of a complaint in accordance with [s 53](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s53.html) would be at least one appropriate originating process for the institution of a customs or excise prosecution, because what is sought is an order for the payment of money. But that does not mean that the laying of an information is necessarily inappropriate. The proceedings also relate to an offence for which the defendant is liable upon summary conviction to be punished by the imposition of a penalty, which in my view is contemplated within the phrase "fine, imprisonment, or otherwise" in [s 52.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s52.html) ((52) Jack Brabham Holdings Pty
Ltd versus The Minister (at 646). I have not relied upon [s 4AB(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/s4ab.html) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/) in coming to that conclusion. We were referred to Cheatley versus The Queen <case>; [(1972) 127 CLR 291] for a discussion of the phrase "punishable ... upon summary conviction", but it sheds no light on this point.) That section describes the availability of an information where the defendant is "liable" to punishment on conviction. There has been some debate as to whether a conviction ought in fact to be recorded in a successful customs or excise prosecution. Both <case> and [s 248](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s248.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) specifically contemplate a conviction being recorded in a customs prosecution, as do [s 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s5.html) and [s 137](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s137.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) in relation to an excise prosecution. In Henry versus Bainbridge-Hawker, ((53)
Incompletely reported at [(1963) 36 ALJR 354.)] a customs prosecution pursuant to [s 254](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s254.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/), Owen J said: "...if the proceedings are successful, the proper order to be made is one convicting the defendant of an offence.
" ((54) Quoted in Button v
Evans (at 351).) 
That, it should be noted, was said in a customs prosecution commenced in the original jurisdiction of the High Court, in which the usual practice and procedures of that Court in civil cases applied pursuant to [s 247.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s247.html) But the question as to whether or not a conviction ought to be recorded in the particular case cannot dictate the availability of an information. The defendant to a customs or excise prosecution must necessarily be suspected of having committed an offence for which he is "liable" to conviction. I am therefore satisfied that an appropriate originating process was used in this case, even if the prosecutions under the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) be regarded as customs prosecutions within the meaning of [s 244](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s244.html) of that Act.
The second part of this third issue was whether the originating process was instituted in the name of the office of the Comptroller as required by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s245.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) and [s 134](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s134.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/). For convenience, I quote again the terms of the information in each case, which asserted that the person who appeared before the justice was - "The Comptroller-General of Customs by Wendy Irene Honey an officer of
Customs duly delegated by the said
Comptroller-General to institute this Customs (or Excise) Prosecution in the name of the said
Comptroller-General of Customs.
"
As inserted in 1982, ((55) By Act 81 of 1982, <case>.) <case> provided merely that a customs prosecution may be instituted "in the name of the
Comptroller". This formulation was criticised by me in Moore versus Jack Brabham
Holdings Pty Ltd ((56) [(1986) 7 NSWLR 198] at 203.) as perpetuating the absurdity previously pointed out in 1958 by Kitto J in Bainbridge-Hawker v
Minister of State for Trade and Customs ((57) <case>; [(1958) 99 CLR 521] at 554 (when the proceedings had to be issued in the name of the Minister).) - that the name of the Comptroller would have to be amended every time the person holding that office was changed - and I suggested that reform was then long overdue.
It took some time, and two attempts, for Parliament to effect that reform. In , <case> was amended to insert "by the Comptroller" before the expression which I have already quoted. ((58) By Act 24 of 1989, <case>.) That did nothing to cure the absurdity. In 1990, <case> was further amended to insert "the office of" after "in the name of", ((59) By Act 5 of 1990, <case>.) so that the section now reads: "Customs prosecutions may be instituted by the Comptroller in the name of the office of the Comptroller by... . " "Comptroller" is defined by <case> to mean the Comptroller-General of Customs.
Similar amendments were made to [s 134](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s134.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/). Accordingly, the relevant section requires the informant (or the plaintiff in the higher courts) to be the Comptroller-General in the name of his or her office as such, so that no longer will there have to be any amendment when the person holding that office is changed.
An information may be laid by the informant in person, or by another person authorized in that behalf. ((60) [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) [s 54.)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s54.html) The
Comptroller-General has power to delegate to an officer of Customs any of the functions and powers of that office and,, when performed or exercised by such a delegate, they are taken to have been performed or exercised by the
Comptroller-General. ((61) [Customs Administration Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caa1985276/), [s 14.)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caa1985276/s14.html) That includes the Comptroller-General's power to institute a customs or excise prosecution. If the officer of the Customs institutes the prosecution in the name of the office of the Comptroller-General, the prosecution is taken to have been instituted by the Comptroller-General in the name of that office.
Prior to 1989, when <case> of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) and <case> of the [Excise
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) were repealed by [s 26](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s26.html) of Act 24 of 1989, any customs or excise prosecution commenced in the name of the Comptroller-General was, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, deemed to have been instituted by the authority of the Comptroller-General. This provision was not re-enacted elsewhere, because what must now be established is a delegation, not an authority. It was necessary in the present case, therefore, for the delegation to Ms Honey (or to Mr Drury) to be established, which the prosecution sought to prove by an averment in both the information and the Summons that he or she was an officer of Customs to whom the Comptroller-General had delegated his powers to institute the prosecution, thereby providing prima facie evidence of that fact. ((62) [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) [s 255](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s255.html), which is limited to customs prosecutions; [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/), [s 144.)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s144.html)
I see no defect in the informations laid in the present case. The
Comptroller-General of Customs is stated expressly to be the informant. In this way, the information differs significantly from that considered by the
High Court in Stuckey versus Iliff. ((63) <case>; [(1960) 105 CLR 164], where the originating process (as described at 170) was in the name of "Iliff an officer of the
Taxation Branch of the Department of the Treasury, in the name of and for and on behalf of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation" and which was held (at -171) not to have been proceedings in the name of the Deputy Commissioner.)
The informations do not state expressly that they are instituted in the name of the office of Comptroller-General of Customs, but that is necessarily implicit in the fact that the name of that office is used rather than the personal name of the then current holder of that office. ((64) cf
Bainbridge-Hawker versus Minister of state for
Trade and Customs (at 530-531).) The words following the name of that office, which identify the officer of Customs to whom it is alleged that the Comptroller-General had delegated his power to institute the customs and excise prosecutions, do not in any way qualify the fact that the proceedings are, by [s 14](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caa1985276/s14.html) of the [Customs Administration Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caa1985276/), to be taken to have been instituted by the Comptroller-General. Those words were strictly unnecessary, although an averment to their effect was necessary in order to prove the delegation. In my view, they should be disregarded as surplusage. The customs and excise prosecutions were thus correctly instituted.
The fourth issue raised in argument was whether the appeal by the
Comptroller-General to the District Court was validly commenced. Again there are in reality a number of issues involved here. Did an appeal lie? Was the appeal properly brought by the informant? Did the absence of the name of any respondent in the Notice of Appeal invalidate the institution of the appeal?
Did the judge err in permitting an amendment to the Notice of Appeal to add to it a reference to one of the charges under the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) which had been dismissed? Again, I will deal with each separately.
Did an appeal lie? This question may be answered speedily.
For the reasons already given, as the prosecutions under the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) were not customs prosecutions within the meaning of [s 244](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s244.html) of that Act, no appeal lay to the District Court from the magistrate's dismissal of them. An appeal lay from the dismissal of the excise prosecution by virtue of <case> of that Act. I turn directly then to the second part of this fourth issue, as to whether the appeal was properly brought by the informant.
The provisions of the law relating to summary proceedings in force in this State here relevant which are picked up by [s 248](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s248.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s137.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) (in each case "(s)ubject to the provisions of this
Act"), and made applicable to an appeal against the dismissal of customs and excise prosecutions, are to be found in <case> and [s 127](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s127.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/).
[Section 122](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s122.html) provides that the appeal is to the District Court, ((65) The
District Court for that purpose is defined by [s 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s3.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) as that
Court in its criminal jurisdiction.) and that the Notice of Appeal must be in writing, stating the intention to appeal and the general grounds of such appeal, and given (or sent by post) to the Clerk of the Local Court within twentyone days after the date when the order was made. The Clerk is then required as soon as possible thereafter to forward a copy of the Notice of
Appeal to the appropriate District Court and to the other party together with notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of the appeal.
If such a
Notice of Appeal is not given to the Clerk within the twentyone days, the appellant may within three months seek leave from the District Court to appeal out of time. [Section 127](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s127.html) is in the following terms: "No appeal shall be defeated merely by reason of any defect, whether of substance or of form, in any notice or statement of grounds of appeal.

The Court hearing the appeal, if of opinion that any such notice or statement is capable of amendment and ought to be amended, may amend the same accordingly, upon such terms, as to postponement or costs, or both, as to the Court seems just." [Section 248](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s248.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) makes it clear that the Commonwealth did not intend to cover the whole field, which would have brought [s 109](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s109.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) into play. ((66) The Queen versus Credit Tribunal; Ex parte GMAC <case>; [(1977) 137 CLR 545] at 451-453, 459-460, 468.) There is nothing inconsistent between [s 127](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s127.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) (which deals expressly only with appeals) and [s 251](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s251.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) or [s 140](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s140.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) (which deal expressly with any "information, summons or other originating process"). There are no provisions of either the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) or the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) which prevent [s 127](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s127.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) from applying. Even if a Notice of Appeal were to be regarded as an originating process, there is no difference in substance between the provisions of [s 127](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s127.html) and those of <case> or [s 140.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s140.html)
The informant in this case was the Comptroller-General of Customs. Both the Notice of Appeal and the Notification of Appeal identified the informant as "Australian Customs Service". This was said by the defendant to be a non-existent body, but that is not correct. It is established by [s 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caa1985276/s4.html) of the [Customs Administration Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caa1985276/), which defines that body as consisting of the
Comptroller-General and the staff appointed or employed under the Public
Service Act for the purposes of the [Customs Administration Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caa1985276/). It is recognized by the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/), which provides in its definition section (s 4) that references in that Act to "Customs" are to the Australian Customs
Service.
The error in the Notice of Appeal was therefore to include with the proper appellant (the Comptroller-General) all of the staff appointed or employed for the purposes of the [Customs Administration Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/caa1985276/). Judge Madgwick permitted an amendment of the Notice of Appeal to substitute the
Comptroller-General for the Australian Customs Service as the appellant. It was submitted that he had no power to do so, relying upon two old cases: Ex parte Harpur ((67) [(1901) 18 WN 24.)] Neither case sheds any light on this point. On the other hand, this
Court's somewhat more recent decision in CAC versus Bain ((69) [(1991) 55 A Crim R .)] appears to me to cover the point precisely. In that case, the informant had been the Corporate Affairs Commission, but the appeal was in the name of an officer of the Commission who had been formally authorized to institute the appeal. It was held ((70) (at 78).) that [s 127](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s127.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) was wide enough to allow the name of the appellant to be amended in such circumstances.
The objection taken to the error made in the present case did not go to the merits of the case, and the defendant could show no prejudice. This was not the filing of a new Notice of Appeal out of time, but rather the amendment of an existing one in order to cure an error in the name of the appellant which was obvious to the defendant. ((71) cf Ex parte Findlay; Re James (at ).) It was the duty of the judge to permit the amendment.
((72) Ex parte
McAuley; Re Cam (1944) 44 SR 258 at 259-260.) He was correct to have done so.
Upon the basis that the prosecutions under the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) were indeed customs prosecutions within the meaning of [s 244](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s244.html) of that Act, the appeal was therefore properly brought by the informant.
The third part of this fourth issue was whether the absence of any name of the respondent invalidated the institution of the appeal. The [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) does not require the appellant to identify the respondent to the appeal. No form of Notice of Appeal has been prescribed, ((73) (although a fee is prescribed for filing such a document: Justices (General) Regulation 1993, cl , Sched 1, item 11).) but a printed form of Notice of Appeal provided in
Local Court registries, which was used in this case, does not require such identification either.
No doubt that is - as I said earlier - because, except in relation to customs and excise and similar revenue prosecutions, an unsuccessful prosecutor is not entitled to appeal against the dismissal of the charges. ((74) I refer later to the appeals against sentence (including an appeal against the dismissal of proceedings pursuant to <case> of the [Crimes
Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/)) now permitted to the State Director of Public Prosecutions.) The appellant was not required to serve the respondent (the defendant) with the
Notice of Appeal and, by the time it was forwarded to the defendant by the
Clerk of the Court, it was accompanied by the
Notification of Appeal to the
District Court which nominated the defendant as the respondent. I am satisfied that the absence of the respondent's name in the Notice of Appeal did not invalidate the appeal.
The last part of this fourth issue was whether the judge erred in permitting an amendment to the Notice of Appeal to add to it a reference to one of the charges under the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) which had been dismissed. The charges dealt with and dismissed by the magistrate were three alleging a breach of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) and two alleging a breach of [s 61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s61.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/).
Both the Notice of Appeal and the Notification of Appeal to the District Court refer only to three charges based on [s 33(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/).
If, as the Stated Case asserted, there had only ever been three charges against the defendant company (two under the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) and one under the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/)), and as all three had been dismissed by the magistrate, it would have been clear from the Notice of Appeal that the intention of the appellant was to appeal against the dismissal of all three. All three fell broadly within the description in the document of "move goods under control of customs" used in the document, including the charge under [s 61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s61.html) of the [Excise
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/). The defect in the Notice of Appeal would have lain in the description of one of the three charges in relation to which the appeal was brought as having been under the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) rather than under the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/). That would not have been a case where an appeal had been brought against only some of the charges upon which the appellant was unsuccessful in the Local Court and an attempt was being made, outside the relevant time prescribed by [s 122](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s122.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), to add to the Notice of Appeal one of those not previously included. It would have been a defect in the document by way only of misdescription. If a judge hearing an appeal to the District Court has power even to amend the charge which had been heard in the
Local Court which is held on appeal to be unknown to the law, by adding to it the missing ingredient of the charge, ((75) Regina v Salamane (1964) 81 WN [(Pt 1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s1.html) 192 at 196-197 (The
High Court did not deal with this issue on appeal: Bacon versus Salamane [(1965) 112
CLR 851.)] I would have seen no reason why [s 127](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s127.html) of that Act should not permit the amendment of a Notice of Appeal in order to cure a defect by way of misdescription which would have been obvious to the defendant. ((76) Ex parte
McCauley; Re Cam (at 259-260); CAC versus Bain (at 78).) Insofar as the judge thought that to be the case, he would in my view have been correct to have permitted the amendment.
That, however, has turned out not to be the case. The Notice of Appeal did not reveal any intention on the part of the appellant to appeal against all of the charges dismissed by the magistrate. It was not a defect in the
Notice of Appeal by way of description which could be cured by substitution of the description of one of the charges by another description in order to accord with the clear intention of the appellant. What was required was an addition (not a substitution) to cure an omission (not a defect by way of misdescription).
The defendant has argued that what the Comptroller-General was m truth attempting to do was to appeal out of time against the dismissal of one of the charges under [s 61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s61.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/). [Section 122(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s122.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) requires the Notice of Appeal to be filed with twentyone days after the date upon which the final order (of dismissal) is made. That order was made on 9
September 1992. [Section 122(1A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s122.html) permits an application for leave to appeal against such an order to be made to the District Court within three months after that date. [Section 124](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s124.html) provides that the District Court may grant such leave to appeal where, in its opinion, the appellant has shown sufficient cause for his failure to give notice of appeal within the twentyone days specified in [s 122(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s122.html) and where it is in the interests of justice to do so.
The period during which leave could be sought to appeal expired in December
The issue of the competence of the appellant's notice of appeal arose at the hearing of the appeal in the District Court. That was not until August , which was outside the three months period specified in [s 122(1A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s122.html) and thus it was too late at that stage to obtain leave to appeal. The amendment which the judge allowed to the existing Notice of
Appeal, the defendant said, had the inappropriate effect of permitting the Comptroller-General to appeal out of time.
The
Comptroller-General sought to counter that argument in various ways.
The offer was made as late as three days ago to have Mr Clugston (of the
Australian Government Solicitor's office) give evidence that it was in fact his intention to appeal against the magistrate's decision in relation to all informations dismissed by him, so that this Court (or alternatively the
District Court) could amend the
Notice of Appeal to include a reference to all five informations dismissed by the magistrate. However, the Notice of Appeal was not
Mr Clugston's document - it was signed on his behalf by George W
Turnbull. In any event, whether or not such evidence would be admissible (a point which I do not decide), it is now far far too late for such a course to be followed.
Reference was made by the Comptroller-General to [s 15C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/s15c.html) of the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/) (which effectively replaced <case>), which permits amendments to any "indictment, information or summons" to enable the real dispute to be determined provided that the amendment can be made without injustice to the defendant. It is unnecessary to determine whether that provision applies to a
Notice of Appeal, as it has been held that such a provision cannot be used to defeat a statutory limitation period such as is found in [s 15B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/s15b.html) (which replaced s 21). ((77) Gilmour versus Midways Springwood Pty Ltd <case>; [(1980) 49 FLR 36] at 90-91.) Such an interpretation, in my opinion, should also be applied to [s 127](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s127.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) (earlier quoted) which deals specifically with defects in the substance or form of a Notice of Appeal, and which does not differ in substance from <case>.
Reference was then made to the abrogation of the rule in Weldon versus Neal ((78)  <case>; [(1982) 66 FLR 90] at 112-113; AMIEV versus Sunland Enterprises Pty Ltd (at 90).) SCR
Pt 20 r 4 permits an amendment notwithstanding the expiration of a statutory limitation period where the new cause of action arises out of the same or substantially the same facts. ((80) See, for example, McGee versus Yeomans [(1977) 1
NSWLR 273]
The suggested relevance of the Supreme Court Rules to an amendment to a
Notice of Appeal from the Local Court to the District
Court has remained obscure. It was first argued that, by reason of [s 136](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s136.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/), the civil procedures of the relevant court are applicable to an appeal from the dismissal of an excise prosecution. The District
Court has in its civil procedures a similar power of amendment. ((81) DCR [Pt 17](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/index.html#p17) T 4.) The relevant court here, however, was the District Court in its criminal jurisdiction. It was to the criminal jurisdiction, not to the civil jurisdiction, that the appeal lay, ((82) See the definition of "District Court" in [s 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s3.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/).) and the civil procedures of the District Court do not in general apply to it in its criminal jurisdiction. ((83) [District Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/), [s 7.)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s7.html) The rules as to the power to amend do not apply to the criminal jurisdiction of the District Court. The provisions of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/), in particular [s 137](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s137.html) (applying the provisions of the law relating to summary proceedings to appeals from the dismissal of an excise prosecution), must take the nature of the appellate procedure in the District Court as it exists.
((84) Sweeney versus Fitzhardinge <case>; [(1906) 4 CLR 716] at 560-561.) It was secondly argued that [s 127](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s127.html) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) is in any event wider than the power to amend in the Supreme and District
Courts. I have already held that that provision cannot be used to defeat a statutory limitation period.
Accordingly, I am satisfied that the judge erred in permitting such an amendment to the Notice of Appeal by adding a reference to one of the charges under [s 61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s61.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) which had been dismissed. Again, that decision means that, from a practical point of view, it is strictly unnecessary for this Court to determine any of the remaining issues concerning the nature of the appeal in the District Court and the jurisdiction of this Court to determine the Stated Case. Once more, these matters were fully argued and they are of important relevance in other pending appeals.
I propose therefore to deal with them.
The fifth issue raised in argument was whether Judge Madgwick erred in holding that he had a discretion to exercise "appellate restraint" in relation to what was, in substance, an appeal by the prosecutor against the inadequacy of a sentence. He was referring to the element of double jeopardy involved in successful Crown appeals against sentence which result in a more severe sentence being imposed by the appellate court. It has been described as a "fundamental principle".
((85) "Prosecution appeals against sentence ", P
Byrne, [(1988) 62 ALJ 465] at 468.)
One of the earliest reported references to the element of double jeopardy in relation to Crown appeals against sentence was in the joint judgment of
Brennan, Deane and Gallop JJ of the Federal Court in Regina versus Tait and
Bartley. ((86) [(1979) 24 ALR 473] at 476.) The expression rapidly gained acceptance in relation to Crown sentence appeals in this Court. ((87) Some of the decisions are collected in Regina versus Holder and Johnston [(1983) 3 NSWLR 245] at 367-368;
Regina versus Allpass [(1993) 72 A Crim. R 561] at 209-210; Everett versus The Queen (at 302).) It has become accepted that the distress occasioned to a respondent to a Crown sentence appeal by twice being put in jeopardy of his freedom (or of his vested interest in the sentence of the primary tribunal) usually requires a discount to be applied by the appellate court. Indeed, so important is this consideration in Crown sentence appeals that the appellate court will not infrequently exercise its discretion to dismiss the appeal because of the unfairness or injustice which would otherwise be occasioned to the respondent by reason of his double jeopardy. ((88) Regina versus Holder and Johnston (at 255-256).
Reference is made to a number of instances of such a discretion being exercised in Regina v
Wayne Anthony Myers (CCA, 13 February , unreported) at 9.) There is no tariff for the discount for the double jeopardy involved. In some cases, the fresh sentence imposed win not be less (or not greatly less) than that which ought to have been imposed at first instance; in other cases, the discount may be substantial. The extent of the discount must vary according to the individual circumstances of the particular case; in most cases, the relevant circumstances are those subjective to the respondent himself. ((89) Regina v
Seung Ho Bang (CCA, 1 September , unreported), per Hunt CJ at CL at 2.)
The Comptroller-General has argued that such an element does not enter into prosecution appeals to the District Court against the inadequacy of sentences imposed in the Local Court. He points out that an appeal from the
Local Court to the District Court pursuant to Div 4 of [Pt 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/index.html#p5) of the [Justices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) proceeds by way of a hearing completely de novo. ((90) Builders Licensing
Board versus Sperway Constructions Pty Ltd <case>; [(1976) 135 CLR 616] at 620; Regina v
Longshaw (at 560-561). See also Powell versus Streatham Manor Nursing Home [(1935)
AC 243] at 249, 263; Ex parte Day; Re Crampton (1943) 43 SR 349 at 350-351.)
Reliance is placed upon what I said on behalf of this Court in Budget Nursery
Pty Ltd versus FCT: ((91) [(1989) 42 A Crim. R 81] at 87.) "The judge of the District Court hearing an appeal pursuant to the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) must decide for himself what penalty is to be imposed, not whether that (or those) imposed by the magistrate was (or were) appropriate. It is not like a sentence appeal to this Court. It is certainly inappropriate for the judge to consider only whether he should either reduce or increase the penalty imposed by the magistrate; it is also inappropriate to consider only whether he should interfere with that penalty. He must in every case proceed to consider for himself in the exercise of his own discretion what penalty should be imposed That is not to say that he cannot agree with what the magistrate has done, but he may do so only if such penalty imposed by the magistrate accords with his own independent assessment of the circumstances of the case.
"
The defendant has submitted, in effect, that what was said in that judgment must (as must what is said in every judgment) be read secundum subjectam materiam. ((92) Commonwealth versus Bank of New South Wales <case>; [(1949) 79 CLR ] at 637-638.) It was a convicted defendant's appeal, in substance against the severity of the appeal only. That, it was submitted, is an entirely different situation to a prosecution appeal against sentence. In the convicted person's appeal, there is no freedom or vested interest in the sentence of the primary tribunal which is put in jeopardy so far as the respondent to that appeal (the prosecutor) is concerned. In a prosecution appeal, the element of double jeopardy arises so far as the respondent is concerned whatever the nature of the hearing, de novo or stricto sensu. The principle of double jeopardy, it was said, is a necessary concomitant to the legislative interference with the fundamental principle that a person shall not be twice vexed for one and the same cause by permitting Crown appeals. ((93) Green v
United States (1952) 355 US 184 at 187-189; Davern versus Messel (at 29-30, 49, 55, , 66-67);
Everett versus The Queen (at 299).)
The question of the application of the principle of double jeopardy in prosecution appeals against sentence from the Local Court to the District
Court did not arise until fairly recently. Until the State Director of Public
Prosecutions was given the power to bring such appeals in relation to sentence in late 1988, ((94) [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) ss131AA-131AC.) the only such prosecution appeals against sentence which were possible were those which arose in customs and excise and similar revenue prosecutions such as that in the present case.
We were not referred to any such case in the District Court in which this issue arose for discussion. No one has found a decision of this Court which discusses it.
However, the issue has arisen in this Court in relation to the State
Director of Public Prosecution's appeal, in Regina versus Longshaw. ((95) [(1990) 20
NSWLR 554.)] The scheme of Div 4A of [Pt 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/index.html#p5) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) (in particular ss
AA-131AC) by which the Director of Public Prosecutions is permitted to appeal against sentences imposed in the
Local Court, although to some extent sui generis, has much more in common with the ordinary appeal from the Local
Court to the District
Court pursuant to Div 4 of [Pt 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/index.html#p5) than with Crown appeals against sentence brought to this Court from sentences imposed in criminal trial courts (where the person sentenced was convicted on indictment) pursuant to [s 5D](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5d.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/). ((96) (at 563).) The latter are appeals stricto sensu. ((97) Griffiths versus The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293 at 308; Regina v
Longshaw (at 561).) Both as a matter of history and as a matter of relationship between the various courts, the position which exists as between this Court and the criminal trial courts on the one hand, and between the
District Court and the Local Court on the other hand, is significantly different. ((98) Regina versus Longshaw (at 562).) A judge of the District Court hearing an appeal by the Director of Public
Prosecutions against a sentence imposed in the Local Court is therefore called upon to exercise that judge's own discretion, to consider what that judge considers proper and is not limited to a review of the sentence imposed in the Local Court or to deciding whether the magistrate had erred in law. ((99) (at 565).)
In that case, however, this Court did not have to determine the question of the application of the principle of double jeopardy to such prosecution appeals pursuant to Div 4A of [Pt 5.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/index.html#p5) Nevertheless, it did draw attention to the similarity between the powers of the District Court hearing such an appeal and those of this Court in Crown appeals pursuant to [s 5D.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5d.html) ((100) (at 563).)
Section 131AB(2) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) permits the District Court, if the appeal is successful, in its discretion to "impose such sentence as may seem proper to the District
Court". Section 5D permits this Court, if the appeal is successful, in its discretion to "impose such sentence as to the said court may seem proper", whereas <case> of the Justice Act - which specifies the powers of the District Court in the ordinary appeal from the Local Court pursuant to Div 4 of Pt 5 - has no similar provision. Gleeson CJ, whose judgment became that of the Court, said that what the presence of those words in <case>, as in <case>: ((101) (at 563).) " ... serves to emphasise is that a Crown appeal in a criminal matter involves an element of double jeopardy and the relevant discretionary considerations, especially in varying a sentence, are not the same as those in an appeal by an unsuccessful defendant. " 
That distinction remains whether the Crown appeal against sentence is heard in the District Court or in this Court, notwithstanding the significant difference in the nature of the appeal in each case. In my view, the judge hearing an appeal by the State Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to Div
A of [Pt 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/index.html#p5) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) must take the element of double jeopardy into account.
It was submitted by the Comptroller-General that an appeal to the
District
Court against the dismissal of a customs or excise prosecution by a magistrate pursuant to [s 19B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/s19b.html) of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/) (broadly, the equivalent of s
A of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/)) - in other words, an ordinary appeal from the
Local Court pursuant to [Pt 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/index.html#p4) of Div 5 of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) - should not be regarded as an appeal against sentence. Reliance is placed upon what Street CJ said on behalf of this Court in Collector of Customs versus Tallerman and Co Pty
Ltd ((102) (1975) 2 NSWLR 832 at 834.) that, where a charge has been dismissed pursuant to <case>, it is a substantive dismissal, and the appeal pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s248.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) could not properly be regarded "as a mere appeal against sentence". This Court was dealing with the question whether a "mere appeal against sentence" fell within the terms of [s 248.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s248.html) ((103) Its terms are quoted earlier in this judgement.) It was held that an appeal against such a dismissal did fall within [s 248.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s248.html) With all due respect to the present submission, that decision has nothing to do with the question whether the judge who hears the appeal should take the element of double jeopardy into account when assessing the appropriate sentence to be imposed. In my view, the judge must take it into account in such a case.
When Parliament provided by [s 248](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s248.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) and [s 137](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s137.html) of the [Excise Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) that the provisions of the law relating to summary proceedings in force in the State where the proceedings are instituted shall apply to all customs and excise prosecutions before a court of summary jurisdiction in that
State, again they took the Local Court and the nature of the appellate procedure in the District Court as they found them. ((104) Sweeney v
Fitzhardinge (at 730); Regina v
Longshaw (at 562).) The approach which is taken in such appeals is therefore applicable to customs and excise prosecutions commenced in the Local Court.
Thus, although the District Court judge hearing a prosecution appeal against sentence pursuant to Div of [Pt 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/index.html#p5) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) must (as does the judge hearing such an appeal pursuant to Div 4A) exercise his or her own sentencing discretion, rather than review the sentence which was imposed below (as does this Court), when imposing such sentence as that judge thinks is proper in the circumstances of the particular case, the element of double jeopardy must be taken into account in assessing what that proper sentence should be.
((105) As it is a prosecution appeal, the obligations of the judge discussed in Parker versus DPP [(1992) 28 NSWLR 282] would not apply.) in my view, therefore, Judge Madgwick did not err in taking that element into account.
The final issue raised in argument was the jurisdiction of this Court to determine the Stated Case. It was stated pursuant to [s 5B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html) of the [Criminal
Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/), which permits a judge of the District Court to submit for this
Court's determination "any question of law arising on any appeal to the
District Court in its criminal and special jurisdiction" coming before that judge. The defendant submitted that the only procedure available by which a case could be stated by a District Court judge in a matter such as this was that provided by [s 131A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s131a.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/), which permits such a judge to submit for the determination of the Supreme Court "any question of law arising on any appeal to the
District Court coming before him not being a question of criminal law". The argument is that the present prosecutions were entirely civil in nature, and that this Court's jurisdiction was denied. ((106) See, for example, Young versus Campbell (1948) 49 SR 103 at 108-109;
Regina versus Diakakis SR 15 at 17-18,19,20.)
There are at least two answers to that submission. The first is that, as
I have already said, these customs and excise prosecutions are proceedings in relation to criminal offences and are thus of a criminal nature. [Section 131A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s131a.html) would not apply. The second answer is that, as I have already pointed out, the appeal from the Local Court pursuant to Div 4 of [Pt 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/index.html#p5) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) is heard by the District Court in its criminal jurisdiction - as "District Court" is defined by [s 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/s3.html) of the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/). The Stated Case here seeks the determination of questions of law "arising on (an) appeal to the District
Court in its ... criminal jurisdiction", and therefore they fall directly within the terms of [s 5B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/). I am satisfied that this
Court has jurisdiction to determine this Stated Case.
I turn at last to the questions posed for this Court's determination. 
QUESTION 1: "In relation to the respondent did I err in holding that the
Notice of Appeal was competent and sufficient to institute an Appeal? " 
The form of the question is ambiguous, as the issue raised depends not only upon whether the absence of the name of any respondent invalidated the appeal and upon the exercise of the judge's discretion to permit the amendments made to the name of the appellant but also upon whether the judge erred in permitting the amendment made to the charges to which the Notice of Appeal related. In respect to that issue, which also arises under Question 2, the judge was in error. For the reasons already given, I propose that this question be answered "Yes". The appeal to the District Court must now be dismissed as incompetent.

QUESTION 2: "In relation to the respondent did I err in holding that the
Notice of Appeal was capable of amendment in the manner permitted, in particular:- in permitting the substitution of Comptroller-General of Customs for
Australian Customs Service? in permitting an appeal from the orders made by the Orange Local Court in relation to the offence charged under [Section 61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/s61.html) of the [Excise Act, 1901](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea190180/) ? " 
For the reasons already given, I propose that this question be answered "(a)
No; (b) Yes". 
QUESTION 3: "In relation to the appeal, have I erred in law in not recording a conviction after having expressed the view that I would have adopted that course had
I been sitting at first instance? " 
The form of this question invites this Court to say whether, if an appeal lay from the District
Court to this Court in relation to this matter, we would have upheld it. That is not a permissible question to be asked in a Stated
Case. The procedure provided by [s 5B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) is intended to permit the District Court judge to obtain advice from this Court upon questions of law which will assist that judge in determining the fate of the appeal to that Court pursuant to the [Justices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/). ((107) Re Van De Lubbe SR 309 at 312; Regina versus Alexander William Madden (at 5).) The procedure is not intended to provide a means of challenging the ultimate determination made (or to be made) by the judge upon that appeal to the
District Court, as there is no right of appeal to this Court from that determination. The question asked here is in form no more than an attempt to exercise such a right of appeal. It is for that reason that this Court has said, and often repeated, that it is necessary for the particular question or questions of law upon which advice is sought to be specifically stated. ((108)
See, for example, Re Van De Lubbe (at ); Law Society versus Goodwin [(1972) 2
NSWLR 462] at 464; Regina versus Alexander William Madden (at 5).) 
Nor is the intention behind the question clear. What Judge Madgwick said in his judgment - having accepted that the magistrate had somewhat misconceived what the purpose of the legislation was, having referred in passing to the often cited judgment of Kitto J in L Vogel and Son Pty Ltd versus Anderson ((109) CLR 157 at 164.) and having accepted the need in this particular case to vindicate the law - was that, if he had been deciding the matter at first instance for himself, he would have entered a conviction in relation to each of the charges and imposed a fine of ten dollars - whether on each charge or in total is not made clear. That conclusion was, however, influenced to at least some extent by the consideration to which the fifth question is directed. The answer to that question will be that he did err in taking that particular matter into account.
The judge then held that he was obliged to exercise judicial restraint (referring to the element of double jeopardy in
Crown appeals) and that - exercising that restraint, although not only for that reason - he did not propose to change the orders which the magistrate had made dismissing the charges pursuant to [s 19B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s19b.html) of the [Crimes Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). The answer to the fourth question will be that the judge did not err in taking that element of double jeopardy into account. I do not see that it is possible to answer this third question, and I propose that it be not answered. 
I should add this. In my view, the judge should have taken substantially more careful note of what Kitto J said in L Vogel and Son Pty Ltd versus Anderson than he appears to have, particularly the passage which I have emphasized in the following quotation: "The Customs laws represent the judgment of Parliament upon an important aspect of the economic organization of the community, and the object of the penal provisions is to make that judgment as effective as possible. It is important to remember that Customs officers have of practical necessity to rely extensively upon the information supplied to them by importers, for the flow of commerce could not be maintained if every importation had to be fully investigated. Moreover, detection of frauds is not always easy. No doubt ordinary conceptions of honesty and of civic responsibility suffice to ensure a great deal of fair dealing with the Customs, but for some people little seems to matter but fear of the consequences of discovery. The [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) makes those consequences potentially drastic. It is for the courts to make them, in suitable cases, drastic in fact for otherwise traders who are not saved by qualms of conscience from willingness to defraud their fellow citizens may weigh the profits they hope for against the penalties they have cause to fear and find the gamble worthwhile. " 
On appeal, it was held by the
High Court that Kitto J's reasons had amply demonstrated why drastic sentences were needed in this class of case. ((110) L
Vogel and Son Pty Ltd versus Anderson (at 168).) 
That was, of course, said in a case in which the offences had been committed in "a sustained course of conscious wrongdoing". ((111) Ibid (at 164).) It is by no means clear from Judge Madgwick's judgment whether he made any particular finding in relation to the deliberation with which the present offences were committed. The defendant company was, of course, made vicariously criminally responsible by [s 33(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s33.html) of the [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/) for the acts of its employees. As the judge acknowledged, the failure to remit the appropriate amounts of duty extended for as long as three months. The judge said that it was necessary to bring it home to customs and excise agents who were corporations that the companies themselves have an obligation, through their directors, to ensure that, "no matter how ordinarily competent and trustworthy and experienced their managers are", controls are instituted which "ensure that there are controls which, if not failsafe, at least enable detection by default within a prompt period". The words "by default" emphasized by me in that quotation are at best equivocal - in that a default may be accidental or deliberate.
 
QUESTION 4: "In relation to the appeal, have I erred in law in expressing the view that in exercising my discretion on sentence I have to exercise appellate restraint? " 
For the reasons already given, I propose that this question be answered "No".

QUESTION 5: "In relation to the appeal, have I erred in law in taking into account on sentence the fact that the respondent company and its directors had faced the worrying prospect of expense in relation to their licence? " 
Judge Madgwick said that, although a conviction for these offences would have to be taken into account by the Comptroller-General in considering whether the defendant company was a fit and proper person to hold a warehouse licence, ((112) [Customs Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/), [s 86.)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca1901124/s86.html) the Comptroller-General would necessarily also have to look at the entirety of the circumstances in which the offence took place.
That is undoubtedly correct. The judge went on to say that it seemed to him that, in the end, the defendant's position would not be much affected by whether a conviction is recorded or not. That may or may not be correct; I simply do not know. But it is important to note that the judge was there excluding the possibility that the defendant company's licence may be affected as being relevant to the sentence to be imposed. Although the possibility clearly was not relevant in the present case, I would not go as far as the
Comptroller-General has submitted, that the loss of a licence by reason of a conviction is always irrelevant in sentencing. ((113)
Re Stubbs (1947) 47 SR , upon which the Comptroller-General relied, decided no more than that the greater financial hardship which the appellant suffered by the loss of his driving licence as a result of a conviction for a driving offence was no basis for the dismissal of the charge pursuant to <case> of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). See also Ex parte Freeman [(1951) 68 WN 111.] But that does not mean that a financial loss flowing from the conviction is irrelevant in mitigation. The loss by a convicted police officer of his accrued financial entitlements over many years Of service was a matter taken into account in mitigation by this
Court in Regina versus Cosgrove and Hunter [(1988) 34 A Crim R 299] at
In the light of the way in which the judge approached the matter in the present case (as referred to in the text), it is unnecessary for us to determine how far that line of authority can be taken.) That is not in issue here. 
What is in issue here is what the judge went on to say: "As against this (that is, that the defendant's position would not be much affected whether a conviction was recorded or not), the company and its directors and shareholders have now faced for some considerable amount of time the very worrying prospect at least of very considerable expense in vindicating their continuing claims to hold a licence, and a potential worsening of their position by the recording of a conviction. " 
A corporation, however, is an abstraction; it has no mind of its own any more than it has a body of its own. ((114) Lennards Carrying Co Ltd versus Asiatic
Petroleum Co Ltd [(1915) AC 705] at 170-171; Shedlezki versus Bronte Bakery Pty Ltd (1970) 72 SR 378 at 385.) It has no "soul to be damned", ((115) Attributed to Edward
Thurlow.) and it is "without body to be kicked". ((116) Aust T and G Mutual Life Assurance
Society Ltd versus Howe <case>; [(1922) 31 CLR 290] at 334.) A corporation cannot worry about the prospect of expense and what may happen if a conviction is recorded. Where persons decide to do their business through the medium of a corporation, it seems to me that the feelings of the directors as to the prospect of such consequences is irrelevant.
 
Where the offender is a natural person, and where there has been a lengthy delay in the matter being dealt with through no fault of the offender, the courts will take into account the effect upon him of the uncertainty as to what was to happen by way of punishment for that crime. ((117) Regina versus Todd [(1982) 2 NSWLR 517] at 64-66.)
That would be irrelevant, however, if the delay in sentencing was the fault of the offender - such as by pleading guilty only at the last moment instead of when first charged. ((118) cf Regina versus Winchester [(1992) 58 A Crim R 345] at .) That, of course, is what happened here so far as the defendant company was concerned. 
In my opinion, the worries of the directors of the defendant company about the prospect of expense and what may happen if a conviction were to be recorded were irrelevant.
I propose that Question 5 be answered "Yes".
That leaves only the question of costs. Both parties deserve criticism for Ming to ensure that the Stated Case correctly stated the facts and adequately raised the issues which were to be argued. Although each party has had both success and failure in relation to the more important issues which were argued, the overall effect of the appeal to this Court is that the
Comptroller-General has lost - there was no valid appeal from the Local Court to the District Court. That does not mean, however, that this Court has no jurisdiction pursuant to [s 5B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/s5b.html) of the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/) to make a costs order in relation to the Stated Case. ((119) Proud versus Blake [(1989) 17 NSWLR 267] at -272.)
