EQUITY - misdescription - compensation 
SALE OF LAND - misdescription - compensation 
The appellant was the purchaser under a contract in the 1988 edition of the standard form signed on 25 May 1989. The only usable access was via a track owned by the Road and Traffic Authority which it allowed the owner to use for a small fee. The vendor did not disclose the access difficulties. Clause 7 (a) of the contract provided "No error or misdescription in this agreement (whether as to the property or as to the title or otherwise) shall annul the sale but ... compensation ... should be made or given ...". The contract was completed subject to a claim by the purchaser under cl 7. The trial Judge dismissed the claim.

HELD: (1) At common law the purchaser under a contract for sale of land could rescind for a trivial deficiency in title or area, or for any other misdescription of the subject matter. Travinto Nominees Pty Ltd versus Vlattas & Anor <case>; [(1973) 129 CLR 1] overruled. (3) The information in the Certificate under [s 149(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html) of the [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/) was incorrect and the Certificate contained an error within cl 7. (4) The error involved an innocent misrepresentation by the vendor which, if material and relied upon, would have entitled the purchaser to rescind, and hence could have annulled the sale for the purposes of cl 7. (5) There was however no evidence that the purchaser read or relied on the [s 149](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html) Certificate. The purchaser did not have a right to rescind the contract, the error could not annul the sale, and there was no right to compensation under cl 7. 
ORDERS 
Appeal dismissed with costs. 
BATEY versus GIFFORD 
PRIESTLEY JA: I have had the benefit of reading in draft Handley JA's reasons in this appeal. He deals with a series of important points in a way which seems to me to be very cogent. However, the last argument he deals with is one which he accepts and which is itself sufficient to dispose of the appeal. I also accept this argument and will base my conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed on it alone.

The argument is a straightforward, mainly factual submission, to the effect that the appellant did not rely on misrepresentation involved in the [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html)
Certificate, therefore had no right of rescission, or right to compensation, and must fail in his appeal. In my opinion this submission is soundly based on the facts and law of the case.

My opinion therefore is that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.
 -------------------- 
Peter BATEY versus Peter John Thomas GIFFORD 
JUDGMENT 
HANDLEY JA: This is an appeal by the purchaser from the judgment of
Hulme J in proceedings arising from a contract for the sale of 31 Rignold
Street, Seaforth entered into at a public auction on 25 May 1989. The contract was in the general form of the 1988 Conditions of Sale approved by the Law
Society and the Real Estate Institute. The property, described as house and land, was comprised in Certificate of Title Volume 6133, Folio 224 and the purchase price was $435,000.

Rignold Street was unmade and access to the land from that direction blocked by a high cliff face. At the rear the land backs onto Boronia Lane which runs roughly parallel with Rignold Street. However this lane, where it adjoins the subject property and a number of nearby properties, was unmade, contained a number of trees, and provided no vehicular access to the property. These difficulties had been overcome by the use of a track from a third street which also ran approximately parallel to Boronia Lane known as Acacia Road. This was owned by the Roads and Traffic Authority which later allowed the purchaser to use it for a fee of $1 per year. The Authority had not granted, and apparently would not grant, any greater rights to the use of the track.

The contract did not disclose these access difficulties. According to the purchaser, he only became aware that he would have no rights over the track after he had entered into the contract. Completion occurred on 15 September and by agreement $21,750, 5% of the purchase price, was retained by the agents to meet claims by the purchaser to compensation under cl 7 arising from non disclosure of the nature of the access to the property.

The vendor commenced proceedings by summons in March 1990 claiming a declaration that he was entitled to the sum retained by the agents. The purchaser filed a cross-claim which sought declarations that the vendor and the agent had engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in connection with the sale, and he claimed damages in addition to compensation under cl 7.

The vendor was a natural person and, when acting as a principal, was not subject to the Trade Practices Act. Although he was subject to <case> of the
Fair Trading Act 1986 1987, which is in the same terms as <case> of the
Trade Practices Act, the former section had no application because the sale by an owner of his own home is not a transaction in trade or commerce. See
O'Brien & Anor versus Smolonogov & Anor [(1983) 53 ALR 107], and Argy v Blunts and Lane Cove Real Estate Pty Ltd <case>; [(1990) 26 FCR 112.] 
The final hearing commenced on 22 July 1993. On 20 July the purchaser gave notice of an amendment to his particulars of misleading and deceptive conduct.
The amendment sought to add a particular that the vendor was knowingly concerned in misleading and deceptive conduct by the agent, a corporation engaged in trade or commerce, and bound by the Trade Practices Act.

At the start of the proceedings on 22 July, the Judge made orders by consent dismissing the purchaser's cross-claim against the agent. The agent remained in the proceedings because the vendor had cross-claimed seeking indemnity or contribution against any liability to the purchaser under the latter's cross- claim for misleading and deceptive conduct.

Counsel for the purchaser then applied for the amendment but this was refused.
The transcript then records the following statement by counsel for the purchaser: "In the light of your Honour's ruling, for the reasons I more or less foreshadowed, the cross-claimant no longer seeks declarations 1, 3 and 4, nor the claim for damages in declarations 6 and 7.

So that the only issue, in effect, is the issue joined in the correspondence originally, where they say there is no misdescription and we say there is.
That really brings the case down to a matter of valuation, if we are right on the legal point. If they are right on the legal point, that is the end of the case. It is really a point of law on the construction of the document".

Counsel for the agent then sought dismissal of the vendor's cross-claim against it with costs. Legal argument ensued during which the Judge and the other counsel said that they understood that counsel for the purchaser had abandoned the claim for misleading and deceptive conduct against the vendor.
Counsel for the purchaser acknowledged that this was so. The Judge dealt with the question of costs and said he would dismiss the cross-claims by the purchaser against the vendor, and by the vendor against the agent, on terms which barred further proceedings. Counsel for the agent then withdrew, and the proceedings continued between the vendor and the purchaser.

The Judge dismissed the claims by the purchaser under cl 7 and ordered that the sum in dispute be paid to the vendor. The principal claim by the purchaser on the appeal was that he was entitled to compensation under cl 7 (the "no error or misdescription" clause). He also attempted to pursue a claim against the vendor for damages for being knowingly concerned in misleading and deceptive conduct by the agent.

A ground of appeal challenged the Judge's decision "in refusing to permit the appellant to seek a finding on the evidence that the respondent had been knowingly concerned in misleading and deceptive conduct by the cross-defendant (the respondent/vendor's agent) in promoting the sale of the property in such a way as to mislead purchasers in relation to the known access difficulties".
If the Court upheld this ground of appeal, the only proper relief would be an order for a new trial of that claim. However at the trial counsel for the purchaser had abandoned this claim, and the vendor had abandoned his cross- claim for contribution or indemnity against the agent.

The Court ruled that this ground of appeal was not available because the purchaser had elected to abandon his claim that the vendor was knowingly concerned in misleading and deceptive conduct by the agent. The vendor had acted on the purchaser's representations to this effect by consenting to the dismissal of his cross-claim against the agent. The vendor would therefore be prejudiced if the purchaser was allowed to revive this claim, because he could not revive his cross-claim against the agent.

The remaining grounds of appeal relate to the purchaser's claim for compensation under cl 7. The Judge rejected the claim that non disclosure of the access difficulties in the contract constituted "an error or misdescription". He said: "I do not see in the contract any statement as to the property's accessibility by person or vehicle. In this regard the description set forth on the front page ... is an accurate account of what was being sold".

This part of the Judge's decision was not challenged on appeal. I should also indicate, for the sake of clarity, that the purchaser did not attempt to rescind either for breach of the Vendor's common law duty to disclose latent defects of title or for misrepresentation, and did not seek damages for fraud or the return of his deposit under <case> (2A) of the Conveyancing Act. Having acquired full knowledge of the access problems after the auction, he elected to complete and claim compensation. The claim under cl 7 that was pressed on appeal was based on cll 11 and 12 of the standard form of contract and the annexed <case> Certificate. These clauses provided: "11. Subject always to any right of rescission that may be available under cl or under the Conveyancing (Vendor Disclosure and Warranty) Regulation no objection, requisition or claim shall be made by the purchaser in respect of any of the following matters: ...

The existence of any other matter affecting the property disclosed in or pursuant to the Second, Third, Fourth or Fifth Schedules, or otherwise in or pursuant to this agreement, which disclosures shall be deemed to be made for the purpose of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s55.html) (1) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) ; ....

The purchaser shall not be entitled to any claim or remedy against the
Vendor for breach of any warranty set out in cl 12 (b) except the right of rescission as provided in the Conveyancing (Vendor Disclosure and Warranty)

The Certificate under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html) of the [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/) annexed to the contract of sale, and referred to in the Fourth and Fifth
Schedules, so far as relevant, stated as follows: "The following prescribed matters are included in this Certificate pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html) of the [Environmental Planning and Assessment

Response to prescribed matter (B).

Manly Environmental Plan 1988 Zone No. 2 residential.

Purposes for which development may be carried out without Development
Consent: bed and breakfast accommodation; dwelling-houses other than dwelling-houses in the Foreshore Scenic Protection Area, home occupations.

Purposes for which development may be carried out only with Development
Consent: any purpose other than a purpose included above or in item (III).

Purposes for which development is prohibited: ...

Pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html) of the [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/) , the following additional information has been provided.

No other information applicable".

The [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html)
Certificate did not show that the land was in a Foreshore Scenic Protection
Area although that was the fact. The Manly Plan also provided (cl 15) that no development could be carried out on land in the vicinity of Rignold Street, including the subject land, until arrangements satisfactory to the Council had been made for access to that land. However the prescribed information in the
Certificate, being that required by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html) , and cl 68 and Schedule 2 of the Regulation, was accurate and complete.

Clause 11 did not confer rights on the purchaser, but protected the vendor from claims and objections in respect of matters disclosed in the contract, including matters disclosed in the [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html)
Certificate. It cannot assist the purchaser in this appeal.

Clause 12 (b) contained a warranty by the vendor that "except as specifically disclosed ... the land is not affected ... by ... any matter prescribed by
Schedule 2 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation". This express warranty only extends to the matters prescribed, and there was no breach because the annexed Certificate contained a correct statement of the information prescribed by Schedule 2. A breach would not have assisted the purchaser in this appeal anyway because cl 12 (c) provided that rescission should be the only remedy.

The purchaser's case was that the <case> Certificate contained an error in the statement pursuant to <case> (5), which was an "error ... in this agreement" within cl 7 and the right to compensation was therefore established.

Section 149 (5) provides that a council may include in a <case> Certificate "advice on such other relevant matters affecting the land of which it may be aware".

The <case> Certificate dated 18 April 1989, annexed to the contract, contained the statement pursuant to <case> (5) that the following additional information had been provided "no other information applicable". However a certificate issued the day before, which the judge found was in the possession of the vendor's agent, and possibly his solicitor prior to the sale, contained the following: "Pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html) of the [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/) , the following additional information has been provided: 
Under the Manly Local Environmental Plan, 1988 the land is situated within the
Foreshore Scenic Protection Area. Clause 17 of the Plan states that the
Council shall not grant consent to the carrying out of development unless it is satisfied that the development will not have a detrimental effect on the amenity of the Foreshore Scenic Protection Area.

No foreshore building line applies to any land under the Manly Local
Environmental Plan, 1988. Development control relating to foreshore building line set backs is either fixed by Council resolution or contained in the relevant development control plan - refer to Council for details.

The Manly Local Environmental Plan, 1988 introduces provisions for controlling development of items of the environmental heritage and their surroundings.

No other information applicable".

The Council was thus aware that other relevant information within [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html) existed which affected the subject land. A certificate containing the same information as the certificate of 17 April was issued to the purchaser on 14
June 1989 but this also added: "The Manly Local Environmental Plan, 1988 requires that no development shall occur until access arrangements satisfactory to Council have been made to the land. Refer to Council for details".

It too concluded "no other information applicable".

The omitted information, particularly that in the June certificate, was clearly relevant to persons proposing to bid for the property at auction. The issue however is not whether there was some non-disclosure, but whether there was an error. In my judgment the statement "no other information applicable" in the annexed certificate was a clear misrepresentation and therefore an error. The statement was false. I cannot agree with Mr Young's submission that the statement only meant that additional information under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html) had not been requested. The statement follows an introduction in these terms: "Pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html) of the [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/) , the following additional information has been provided".

The certificate therefore stated that information under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html) was being provided as stated below. It did not state that additional information had not been requested. The Council may have provided a certificate in that form because there was no request for information under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html) , or perhaps because there was a positive request that information under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html) not be included, but neither statement was conveyed by the certificate.

The next question is whether this error in the certificate was an "error ...
in this agreement". It had become common by 1989 for solicitors acting for vendors to annex a large number of documents to their contracts for sale. In some cases this was mandated by legislation which imposed specific duties of disclosure on vendors, but in other cases annexation was voluntary. Documents were annexed to disclose information to the purchaser and protect the vendor from claims for rescission or compensation. It does not follow that every annexed document forms part of the contract. See Avim Pty Ltd versus Guilianotti [(1989) 16 NSWLR 666] at 671. However the [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html)
Certificate was not simply annexed, it was incorporated as part of the Fifth
Schedule and was referred to in cll 11(g) and 12(b). Both clauses refer to disclosures by the vendor in various schedules, including the Fifth, "or otherwise in ... this agreement", clearly enough recognising that the Fifth
Schedule itself is part of the agreement. Although the vendor did not warrant the information provided pursuant to [s (5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html), nevertheless the certificate was part of the agreement. An error in the certificate was an error in the agreement.

The next question is whether this was an error within cl 7 and if so whether the purchaser was entitled to compensation. This question could not have arisen in relation to the compensation clause in the 1965 edition considered in Travinto Nominees Pty Ltd versus Vlattas & Anor <case>; [(1973) 129 CLR 1.] This provided that "No error or misdescription of the property shall annul the sale, but compensation if demanded in writing before completion ... shall be made or given ..." and only applied to errors etc in the description of the physical subject matter of the sale. The compensation clause was amended for the 1982 edition and the new clause was again included in the 1988 edition. It provides: "7 Errors and Misdescriptions 
No error or misdescription in this agreement (whether as to the property or as to title or otherwise) shall annul the sale but, subject to clause 7(b) the compensation if demanded or offered in writing before completion but not otherwise shall be made or given ...,".

These compensation clauses cannot be construed without a proper understanding of their history and the rules of law and equity which otherwise apply. This was explained by Menzies J in Travinto Nominees Pty Ltd versus Vlattas at 27-8: "These conditions do not attempt to state the main rights and duties of the parties but merely modify these rights and duties in certain particular respects. The rights and obligations of the parties still largely depend upon the common law, as tempered by the rules of equity. It is necessary to understand these before applying these conditions. Williams on Vendor and
Purchaser, 4th ed, (1936) at pp 34-37 sets out the chief duties of a vendor at common law: ...
To produce land corresponding substantially in all respects with the description contained in the contract and available to be transferred to the purchaser in fulfilment of the contract; and ...

At common law, any difference, however trivial, between the land described in the contract and the land produced constituted a defect which entitled the purchaser to rescind.

Where there was only a slight difference, the Courts of Equity began to interfere and introduced the principle of compensation for deficiency ...
Unless the deficiency was so substantial as to give the purchaser something entirely different from what he had contracted (to buy), equity would order specific performance on giving compensation for the deficiency.

Also to avoid the harsh effect of the common law, it became the practice to insert in contracts a clause stating that a difference from the description of the subject matter would not annul the sale".

As Lord Eldon said in Seton versus Slade <case>; [(1802) 7 Ves 265] [(32 ER 108)] at 274 (111) " ... the slightest objection is an answer at law". See also Dainford Ltd versus Lam & Anor [[1985] 3 NSWLR 255] at 265-6 per Powell J; and Tarval Pty Ltd versus Stevens & Ors [(1990) NSW Conv R -552 (CA).] The vendor's obligation at law under a contract for the sale of real estate by description was similar to that of a seller under a contract for the sale of goods by description. The description was an essential term of the contract and the purchaser could reject the goods if there was any difference, other than trifling, between the goods tendered and the contractual description. See Arcos Ltd versus E A Ronaasen & Son <case>; [[1933]
AC 470.] 
Compensation clauses which provide that no error or misdescription shall annul the sale refer to errors or misdescriptions which would "annul" the contract at law. There was no automatic annulment but the purchaser could rescind. See
Travinto Nominees Pty Ltd versus Vlattas at 27; and Stephens versus Selsey
Renovations Pty Ltd  <case>; [(1806) 13 Ves Jun 73] [(33 ER 222)] at 77(223): "... equity does not permit the forms of law to be made instruments of injustice; and will interpose against parties, attempting to avail themselves of the rigid rule of law for unconscientious purposes. Where therefore advantage is taken of a circumstance, that does not admit a strict performance of the contract, if the failure is not substantial equity would interfere. If for instance the contract is for a term of 99 years ... and it appears that the vendor has only 98 or 97 years, he must be non suited in an action: but equity will not so deal with him; and if the party can have the substantial benefit of his contract, that slight difference being of no importance to him, equity will interfere. Thus was introduced the principle of compensation ...".

A purchaser could waive his right of rescission and complete on payment of the full purchase price. There was no right at law to an abatement of the purchase price because the rule in Flureau versus Thornhill <case>; [(1776) 2 Black W 1078] [(96 ER 635)], later known as the rule in Bain versus Fothergill [(1874) LR 7
HL 158], denied the purchaser any legal right to damages or compensation in such cases. Equity however would decree specific performance with compensation at the suit of the purchaser.

Thus compensation clauses apply to errors and misdescriptions which would have entitled the purchaser at law to rescind and restrict this right of rescission. Such clauses, like other exclusion clauses, were strictly construed and did not require the purchaser to accept, with compensation, something entirely different from what he had contracted to buy. This has been settled since Flight versus Booth <case>; [(1834) 1 Bing (NC) 370]
Tindal CJ said at 377 (1162-3) that: "... where the misdescription ... is in a material point, so far affecting the subject matter of the contract that it may reasonably be supposed that, but for such misdescription, the purchaser might never have entered into the contract at all ... the contract is avoided altogether, and the purchaser is not bound to resort to the clause of compensation".

As a general rule therefore, compensation clauses cover errors or misdescriptions, even a trivial kind, which would have entitled the purchaser to rescind at common law, but do not cover cases where the error or misdescription is so substantial that it "annuls" the sale in accordance with the rule in Flight versus Booth.

The question then is whether the error in the [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/epaaa1979389/s149.html)
Certificate is within cl 7 of this contract. The words "no error or misdescription of the property" in the 1965 and 1972 editions had been replaced by "no error or misdescription in this agreement (whether as to the property or as to title or otherwise) ...". In this case there was no error or misdescription either of the physical subject matter or the title, but there was an error "otherwise". Professor Butt considered that the 1982 cl 7 covered errors which did not relate to the physical subject matter or title. ("The
Standard Contract for Sale of Land in New South Wales" 1985 at pp 361-2.) See also Firsby Pty Ltd versus Erina Street Investments Centre Pty Ltd (1991) NSW
Conv R 59,167 at 59,172. However a narrower view was taken in Avim Pty Ltd v
Guilianotti [(1989) 16 NSWLR 666] at 669 where Young J said "this is far too wide a construction of the clause". He continued at 670: " ... the only relevant errors or misdescriptions are those which might `annul' the sale. It must always be remembered that the law without this clause may operate to permit the purchaser to rescind the contract if there is an error or defect in title of sufficient magnitude ... Thus it is not every misdescription or error which is comprehended in the opening words of cl 7 but only those errors or misdescriptions which might permit the purchaser to claim that it is unable to get the whole of what it contracted to buy ...

When one is considering whether or not there has been a relevant error within the meaning of cl 7 for which compensation should be given, one needs to see what was the property sold. This has always been the approach in cases under the clause before it was amended and in my view is still the proper approach.
 for the plaintiff says that since the words in the clause were expanded, the approach is no longer valid. Any error will attract a claim for compensation if the purchaser can show that the error has cost it money. It seems to me, however, that the clause in its expanded form merely took the parties back to the law as it was understood to have been ...

The only errors or misdescriptions which could annul the sale are those pursuant to which the purchaser could get something substantially less than it bargained for".

This reasoning was approved by McLelland J in Tefbao Pty Ltd versus Stannic
Securities Pty Ltd (1990) 5 BPR 11,189 at 11,192, but was doubted by Hodgson
J in Firsby Pty Ltd versus Erina Street Investments Centre Pty Ltd at 59172, who referred to the contrary views of Mason JA, as he then was, in Beard v
Drummoyne Municipal Council [(1969) 71 SR 250] at 268.

Counsel for the respondent attempted to support the reasoning of Young J by reliance on [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lraea1972263/s5.html) of the [Law Reform (Law and Equity) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lraea1972263/) which provides that in the event of any conflict the rules of equity shall prevail over the rules of law. Accordingly in his submission the right at law to rescind for trivial deficiencies had been abrogated. Equity however only interfered in these cases for the purpose of granting specific performance, and where this was not sought, the rules of law were not affected. See
Dainford Ltd versus Lam [(1985) 3 NSWLR 255] at 263, -8. The analysis earlier in these reasons of the history of compensation clauses and the rules of law and equity which otherwise apply leads me to respectfully disagree with the reasoning in Avim Pty Ltd versus Guilianotti and to endorse the views of Professor Butt.

Compensation awarded in equity ancillary to specific performance was only available as Lord Haldane said "for a deficiency in the subject-matter described in the contract" (Rutherford versus Acton-Adams [1915] AC 866 at 870) or as Starke J said "for some diminution or deterioration in the value of the property contracted to be sold". (King versus Poggioli <case>; [(1923) 32 CLR 222] at 246.) Compensation could not be awarded for unliquidated damages for breach of contract (King versus Poggioli at 246), or for "a claim to make good a representation about (the) subject matter made not in the contract but collaterally to it". (Rutherford versus Acton-Adams at 870.) 
Although the clause applies to this error, the purchaser's only right is to "compensation". An express entitlement to compensation conferred by clauses which sought to incorporate the equitable rights of the parties into the contract will be understood as an entitlement to the compensation which would otherwise have been awarded in equity. However the present clause purports to confer a right to compensation in respect of "errors" for which equity would never have awarded compensation in specific performance proceedings.

The expanded clause applies to errors which might otherwise "annul" the sale.
Errors or misdescriptions reflecting deficiencies in title or subject matter answer this description, but this is not necessarily the case with other errors. Thus breaches of warranty sounding only in damages cannot annul the sale and therefore cannot support a right to compensation under cl 7. The error in this case involved an innocent misrepresentation in the contract which, if material and subject to proof of reliance, could support a right to rescission in equity and thus "annul" the sale.

If such an error is within this compensation clause, the purchaser has a right to compensation. Equity had a concurrent jurisdiction in cases of actual fraud, and as Lord Haldane said in Nocton versus Lord Ashburton [[1914] AC ] at 952: "Operating in personam as a Court of conscience it could order the defendant, not ... to pay damages as such, but to make restitution, or to compensate the plaintiff by putting him in as good a position pecuniarily as ... he was before the injury".

See also Demetrios versus Gikas Dry Cleaning Industries Pty Ltd & Ors [(1991) 22 NSWLR 561] at 573. Therefore where, as here, there is a contractual right to compensation for an innocent misrepresentation, it can be assessed on the principles which govern equitable compensation for fraud. However as
Hodgson J said in Firsby Pty Ltd versus Erina Street Investments Centre Pty Ltd at 59172: "... it is necessary that there be at least an error or misdescription that justifies compensation which is more than nominal and which is capable of ascertainment".

The difference between the additional information disclosed pursuant to s (5) in the certificate annexed, and that contained in the certificate issued the day before, and that contained in the certificate of 14 June 1989, may well have been material, but there is no evidence that the purchaser relied upon the misrepresentation in the certificate. He was a barrister practising in family law who did not retain a solicitor in the transaction. A
Mr James Taylor, an engineer, bid on his behalf at the auction, but the contract was signed by the purchaser himself and exchanged that evening. Mr
Taylor "perused" the contract prior to the auction, but did not say whether he read the <case> Certificate or noticed the statement pursuant to <case> (5).

The purchaser "perused" the contract immediately before signing it that evening. He also read the plan of the land annexed. He did not read the <case>
Certificate. Although he later obtained the <case> Certificate dated 14 June, it formed no part of his case at the trial, and was tendered by counsel for the vendor. In fact the purchaser's evidence in cross-examination established that when he signed the contract, he was not interested in the town planning position, and did not take any notice of the <case> Certificate. Since he did not rely on the misrepresentation, he had no right of rescission, and therefore no right to compensation under cl 7.

The appeal fails on this issue and should be dismissed with costs.
