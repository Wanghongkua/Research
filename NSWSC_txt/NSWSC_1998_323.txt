John EDMONDSON VC MEMORIAL CLUB CO-OP LIMITED v Gabriella BARTSCH & ANOR 
JUDGMENT 
MASON P: I agree with Handley JA. 
On the issue of the relevant limitation period, counsel for the plaintiff sought to read down the general terms of [s61](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s61.html) of the [Limitation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) by reference to [s60K(1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60k.html)
It was argued that Solomon DCJ was correct in holding that [s60K(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60k.html) has the effect of extending the limitation period only for the purposes of an action brought in the same court on the same cause of action, but has no effect for other purposes, including a second extension application. One difficulty with this approach is that it fails to grapple with the fact that the statement of claim for which the plaintiff sought leave to file in the second extension application in December 1997 itself pleads in the same court the same cause of action whose limitation period was extended in the first extension application in November 1996.

As Handley JA also points out, the second extension application fails at the dual thresholds of [ss60I(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html) and [60G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60g.html)(2).
On the material before us this is a direct consequence of the careless failure of the plaintiff's solicitor to file a statement of claim in the month allowed pursuant to the original extension application (see Appeal Tr p2). While this would appear to confer certain rights upon the plaintiff against third parties it does not affect her rights as against the appellants in these appeals.

The argument in these appeals did not present an opportunity to explore the circumstances in which no change of the plaintiff's solicitor has occurred between 1996 and the present date, at least as regards the current proceedings. Nevertheless, the court must assume that the plaintiff has or will receive proper advice concerning the most unfortunate situation in which she now finds herself through no fault of her own.

GLADESVILLE RSL CLUB LIMITED & ANOR versus GABRIELLA BARTSCH & ANOR 
JOHN EDMONSON VC MEMORIAL CLUB CO-OP LIMITED versus GABRIELLA BARTSCH & ANOR 
JUDGMENT 
HANDLEY JA: These are consolidated appeals by leave of this Court from a decision of Solomon DCJ who, on 16 December 1997, ordered that the limitation periods for causes of action by Gabriella Bartsch (the plaintiff) against the appellant Clubs be extended until 17 December 1997. The proceedings are unusual, if not unprecedented, because his Honour had previously extended the same limitation periods to 11 December 1996, but the plaintiff's solicitors failed to file a statement of claim within the extended period. 
The plaintiff had worked in a family business known as the Carlingford
Cleaning Company which was managed by her father. She did cleaning work at the premises of the Gladesville Club from December 1983 until the end of 1985. In about August 1984 she also commenced to do cleaning work for the other Club at its premises in Liverpool.

Before she started working at the Liverpool Club, she worked at the
Gladesville Club from about 2 am until about 8 am. While working at this Club she was exposed, it seems every night, to an insecticide sprayed from fixed nozzles within the building. She was exposed there to a different insecticide after August 1984 until the family business lost the cleaning contract for that Club about December 1985.

After the plaintiff commenced to work at the Liverpool Club, she worked there from 2 am to 4 am and then travelled to the Gladesville Club where she would work between 4.30 and 8. While working at the Liverpool Club she was exposed to an insecticide spray similar to that initially used at the Gladesville Club but only for two or three nights a week. She continued to work at the
Liverpool Club until March 1986 when the family business lost the cleaning contract for that Club and she then ceased working in the business.

About August 1984 the plaintiff began to suffer health problems. She also noticed that other members of the family who worked in the business were also complaining of symptoms similar to her own. Her health problems continued after she left the family business. She was unable to obtain regular employment and she went onto unemployment benefits and then sickness benefits and in 1991 was awarded an invalid pension. She consulted her present solicitors in 1992 and in August she was referred to Professor Dennis
Wakefield, a pathologist, and to Dr Phillips, a psychiatrist. Their medico- legal reports, which are in evidence, detail her medical problems, all presumptively caused by exposure to insecticide sprays at the Clubs.

On 31 August 1993, no doubt to obtain the benefit of cl 4 (4)(b) of Schedule 5 of the [Limitation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/), an application for an extension of the limitation periods against the Clubs was filed in the District Court. It did not come on for hearing until 11 November
In his extempore judgment that day the Judge found that the plaintiff was not aware of the nature and extent of her personal injuries until she saw
Dr Mark Donohoe on 9 May 1994, or at least until she read his report of the same day received by her solicitors on 19 May. She then learned that there was no cure for her condition and that she probably would not be able to work again.

This finding satisfied the threshold test in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60.html) I (a)(ii) of the [Limitation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) and enlivened the power to grant an extension of the limitation periods conferred by cl 4 (4) of Schedule 5 and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60.html) G(2) of the Act. The Judge exercised his discretion in favour of the plaintiff making the orders previously referred to. The Clubs did not challenge these orders but the plaintiff's legal advisers failed to commence proceedings on her behalf within the extended periods and this led to the second application.

This was commenced by a notice of motion filed on 1 December 1997. It fell within cl 4 (4)(a) of the Fifth Schedule and had to be made within three years "after the plaintiff became aware (or ought to have become aware)" of all three matters in para (a) [(s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60.html)
I(1)(b)). Two objections to the grant of further extensions raised by the
Clubs remain an issue on the appeals. Both turn on the provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60.html) (1) which provides: "(1) A court may not make an order under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60.html) G ... unless it is satisfied that: the plaintiff did not know that personal injury had been suffered; or was unaware of the nature or extent of personal injury suffered; or was unaware of the connection between the personal injury and the defendant's act or omission at the expiration of the relevant limitation period or at a time before that expiration when proceedings might reasonably have been instituted; and the application is made within 3 years after the plaintiff became aware (or ought to have become aware) of all 3 matters listed in para (a)(i) - ".

The first objection was that "the relevant limitation period" for the purposes of para (a) was the period as extended by the earlier order which expired on December 1996. If this was correct the plaintiff's knowledge of the matters referred to in para (a) would have to be determined by reference to that date, rather than December 1991 in the case of the Gladesville Club, and March 1992 in the case of the Liverpool Club, when the last of the original or primary limitation periods expired.

The second objection was that the application filed on 1 December 1997 was time barred by para (b) in that it was made more than three (3) years after the plaintiff became aware, or ought to have become aware, of all 3 matters in para (a).

The Judge considered the provisions of [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60.html) I, and 60K and held that the relevant limitation periods were the original or primary periods, and not those as extended by his earlier order. He found that at the expiration of the primary periods the plaintiff was aware of the nature of the personal injury she had suffered, and the connection between that injury and the defendants' acts and omissions, but that she was not then aware of the extent of her personal injury. She had not become aware of this until examined by Professor Wakefield in August 1992 and Dr Donohoe in May 1994.

The Judge overruled the time bar objection finding that the plaintiff "was not aware of the extent of her present disabilities until March 1997 when the disabilities became worse". This finding was inconsistent with his earlier finding that such awareness did not occur until May 1994, but there is no doubt that the plaintiff's condition significantly deteriorated during 1997.
This raises in an acute form the question of "top up" or incremental knowledge and its significance in applications for extensions of the limitation period.

The relevant limitation period 
Mr Alexis for the first appellant submitted that "the relevant limitation period" was the period as extended, and relied upon [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s61.html) as supporting this conclusion. Mr Evans for the plaintiff supported the Judge's construction and relied upon [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60.html)
K(1). [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s61.html), which was in the original Act, provides: "Where, after the expiration of the limitation period to which this Division applies, the limitation period is extended by order under this Division, the prior expiration of the limitation period has no effect for the purposes of this Act".
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60.html)
K(1), inserted by the 1990 amending Act, provides: "If a court orders the extension of a limitation period for a cause of action ... the limitation period is accordingly extended for the purposes of: an action brought by the applicant in that court on the cause of action that the applicant claims to have; ...".

This section, although new in the 1990 amending Act, reproduced, in slightly different terms, the concluding provisions of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html) (2) which had been in the Act since 1969.

The Judge held that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60.html) K(1) applied, so that an order extending the limitation period only had effect for the purposes of an action brought in the same court on the cause of action, and had no effect for other purposes, including a second extension application.

It might be thought that this view was excluded by the reference in para (a) to "the relevant limitation period", suggesting that there might be more than one. (Compare [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s58.html), [60C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60c.html) where the word is not found.) However there must be some doubt as to whether "relevant" was inserted to deal with a second application for an extension after the limitation period had previously been extended. The notion that
Parliament envisaged such an extraordinary possibility, and sought to provide for it in this way, seems highly improbable.

The point is, prima facie, covered by the provision in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s61.html) that when the limitation period is extended, the prior expiration of the limitation period has no effect for the purposes of this Act. These include the purposes of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60.html)
I(1)(a) with its reference to the knowledge of the plaintiff "at the expiration of the relevant limitation period".
 [Sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60.html)
K(1)(a) and 61 must be read together, and since neither is expressed to be subject to the other, they must be construed so as to be consistent with each other. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60.html)
K(1)(a) limits the effect of an order extending the limitation period to the court which made that order, and to the cause or causes of action in respect of which it was made.

The plaintiff's submission was that the order for an extension had no other effect, and in particular had no effect for the purposes of an application for a further extension of time. The implicit submission was that the expressio unius est exclusio alterius principle applied and the section should be understood as impliedly denying any other effect to an extension. However as the High Court has said, this principle should be applied with caution (Ainsworth versus Criminal Justice Commission <case>; [(1992) 175 CLR 564], 575), and only when the intention it expresses is discoverable on the face of the instrument. (Houssein versus Under Secretary of
Industrial Relations <case>; [(1982) 148 CLR 88], 94.) 
In my judgment [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60.html) K should not be interpreted in accordance with the expressio unius principle.
No such intention is discoverable on the face of the section, and the perfectly general terms of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s61.html) are inconsistent with such a construction. [Section
K](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60k.html) can and should be interpreted, consistently with [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s61.html), as explanatory of the latter, putting the result of an order beyond doubt, and making clear the limitations on its effect. The relevant limitation period for the purposes of the second extension application therefore expired on 11
December 1996.

The effect of additional knowledge acquired during 1997 
There is no doubt, as Mr Evans demonstrated from the evidence, and the Judge found, that the plaintiff's condition significantly deteriorated during 1997, particularly after March. It became perfectly clear that she would never work again, she is no longer able to undertake housework, or shopping, she cannot open jars or cans, and cannot peel vegetables. In addition she was warned for the first time that she could end up in a wheelchair.

However the plaintiff's condition had been serious for years. She had not worked since 1986, had been on an invalid pension for chronic fatigue since , and had the serious physical and psychological symptoms described in the reports of Professor Wakefield (7/12/92), Dr Phillips (15/10/92) and Dr
Donohoe (9/5/94).

Dr Donohoe in his 1994 report referred to the possibility of some recovery but stated that "in my experience, the majority of people who are exposed to such agents, and who subsequently develop chronic, persistent illness, do not recover sufficiently to be able to return to the workplace". He referred to the steps which the plaintiff could take, such as rest, a healthy diet, and a medium dose vitamin supplement, but said that these "merely serve to diminish the likelihood of the progression of the illnesses she has suffering".
(emphasis supplied) He concluded that the plaintiff "is likely to require long term medical management of her current health problems". Moreover as the plaintiff acknowledged, her condition had been deteriorating over the years.

It is therefore apparent that for many years before December 1996 the plaintiff's knowledge of the nature and extent of her personal injury had been sufficient to justify legal proceedings. She was only 37 when she went on the invalid pension in 1991, and she then had a substantial claim for past and future economic loss to the normal retiring age. In view of Dr Donohoe's 1994 report, the "chance" of her remaining unemployed for the rest of her life would have already been assessed at or close to 100 percent (Malec versus J C
Hutton Pty Ltd <case>; [(1990) 169 CLR 638).] She also had what was clearly a substantial claim for general damages.

In such circumstances, as Gleeson CJ said in Drayton Coal Pty Ltd versus Drain (CA, unrep, 22/8/95) questions of degree arise, and the acquisition of additional knowledge will not automatically mean that the requirements of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60.html)
I(1)(a) are satisfied (above at 7). Indeed as this Court said in F J Walker
Ltd versus Webber (unrep, 16/11/89) at 4: "One can know `the nature and extent' of one's injury even if one is ignorant of the final form which it will take. Few plaintiffs ever know this, even at the time of trial, and it would be difficult to attribute to Parliament an intention that potential plaintiffs may completely disregard limitation periods merely because they are unable to predict their final state".

This passage was approved in Harris versus Commercial Minerals Ltd <case>; [(1996) 186 CLR 1] at 13 and the High Court continued: "... an applicant may have been aware of the extent of his or her injury even though he or she does not expect all its precise consequences, for it is not necessary that the applicant should foresee the exact course of the disease or be aware of all its pathological and physiological incidents. If the applicant was aware that the injury would deteriorate, he or she may be aware of the extent of the injury ... even though the injury developed particular consequences that the applicant did not precisely foresee. As long as the consequences are of a kind that an applicant expected to occur, the applicant will be aware of the extent of the injury. The nature or extent of the injury is not synonymous with the precise pathology or consequences of the injury".

See also Goodchild versus Greatness Timber Co Ltd [[1968] 2 QB 372] CA, 380, 381, ; Miller versus London Electrical Manufacturing Co Ltd [[1976] 2 Lloyd's Rep ] CA.

It is not necessary to reach a final conclusion on this question because in my view the second limb of para (a) clearly applies. This directs an enquiry as to the plaintiff's knowledge at a time before the expiration of the relevant limitation period "when proceedings might reasonably have been instituted".
Proceedings were instituted on 31 August 1993 and it is clear that the knowledge of the plaintiff and her legal advisers of the nature and extent of her personal injury at that time were sufficient to justify legal proceedings and the decision to do so was reasonable.

Difficult questions can arise where a plaintiff, at an earlier point of time, had some knowledge of the nature and extent of his or her personal injury but did not then commence proceedings but seeks to do so later after additional knowledge has been acquired. Extensions have been granted where a plaintiff, with some knowledge of his condition, made a conscious decision not to sue, but changed his mind later after his condition unexpectedly deteriorated. See
Royal North Shore Hospital versus Henderson [(1986) 7 NSWLR 283] and
Thelander versus C D Townsend (Eng) Pty Ltd [(1993) 32 NSWLR 358.] These cases have no application here where the plaintiff, with substantial but not full knowledge, elected to sue on the basis of the knowledge she had.

In any event this Court is called upon to re-exercise the discretion under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60.html)
G(2). In Drayton Coal Pty Ltd versus Drain at 8, Gleeson CJ said: "... a plaintiff might be able to establish that he or she was unaware of the full extent of the personal injury suffered but a court might take the view that, at the relevant time, the plaintiff's awareness, although not complete, was so extensive that it would not be just or reasonable to extend the limitation period".

Similarly in Harris versus Commercial Minerals Ltd at 14, the High Court said: "It may not be just and reasonable, for example, to extend a limitation period if before the expiration of the period the applicant knew or ought to have expected most of the consequences of an injury".

The question whether it is just and reasonable to make a second order extending the limitation period is also affected by the failure of the plaintiff's legal advisers to commence proceedings within the time permitted by the earlier order. In Walkley versus Precision Forgings Ltd [(1979) 1 WLR ]
HL, a plaintiff had commenced proceedings within the limitation period, which became liable to dismissal for want of prosecution. An extension of the limitation period to enable fresh proceedings to be commenced was refused, because as Lord Diplock said (619) "these are self-inflicted wounds". The answer to a question from the Court would indicate that the plaintiff may well have a remedy against her legal advisers, but this is strictly irrelevant in the resolution of the present appeals.

An order for an extension is interlocutory, and as such may be susceptible of variation where, as a result of some accident, illness, mistake or the like, proceedings are not commenced within the extended period and an application is made promptly for the necessary variation. No such question arises in this case and there is no need to express any view on it.

In my opinion the appeal succeeds and the following orders should be made: 
Appeals allowed with costs; 
Set aside the orders of Solomon DCJ of 16 December 1997, and in lieu thereof order that the notice of motion of 1 December 1997 be dismissed with costs; 
The personal respondent is to have a certificate under the Suitors Fund
Act.

The plaintiff's work as a cleaner involved exposure to insecticide spray in the appellants' premises from December 1983 until about March 1986. The plaintiff's health began to deteriorate after August 1984. She consulted solicitors in 1992 who referred her to various medical practitioners. On 31
August 1993 an application for an extension of the limitation periods against the defendants was filed in the District Court and granted on 11 November
The plaintiff's lawyers failed to file a statement of claim within the extended period. An application for a further extension of the limitation period was granted on 16 December 1997.

HELD: Allowing the appeal: (1) The "relevant limitation period" for the purposes of [s 60I](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html) of the [Limitation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/) was the period as extended by the earlier order. (2) Although the plaintiff's condition had worsened after March 1997, her knowledge of the nature and extent of her injuries had been such as to justify the commencement of legal proceedings on 31 August 1993 when proceedings were commenced. This fixed the time before the expiration of the extended limitation period when proceedings might reasonably have been commenced for the purposes of [s 60I(1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/la1969133/s60i.html) (3) There was therefore no power to grant a further extension of the limitation period.
