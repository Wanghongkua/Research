JUDGE1
KIRBY P: The complications that are presented by the [Motor Accidents Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) (the Act), have been substantial and continue. This is but the latest illustration.
 
Statutory caps in the [Motor Accidents Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) and a back-dated order
On 8 December 1994 this Court published its reasons disposing of an appeal and a cross-appeal from orders made in the Common Law Division of the Supreme
Court by Mathews J. The orders of the Court were, in substance, contained in my reasons.
Relevantly, they proposed that the orders of Mathews J be set aside and that in lieu of the judgment which her Honour had entered in favour of the plaintiff, Mr Nicholson, the amount be increased to a sum of $2,199,930. I proposed that the Court should go on to provide that such substituted judgment should be back-dated to take effect from the date of the orders of Mathews J.
This is an ordinary order which is made by the Court where, in damages appeals, it substitutes its assessment of a plaintiff's entitlement for that of the trial judge. The purpose of providing in such terms is to permit a plaintiff to secure the benefit of interest upon the sum found to be proper as from the date of the original judgment so that the plaintiff is not penalised by loss of interest by reason of an established error and the passage of time.
Mahoney JA agreed with the orders proposed by me whilst preserving the position which he has separately stated in earlier decisions of this Court, including Marsland, by his Tutor The Protective Commissioner of New South
Wales versus Andjelic [(1993) 31 NSWLR 162 (CA).] Meagher JA agreed in my judgment.
The orders of the Court therefore became the orders which I had proposed, including the order for retrospective operation of the substituted judgment.
The substituted judgment was made up of a number of component parts. They are set out on p 34 of my reasons. Relevantly, one component part was for an amount for non economic loss for $212,000 as stated in the schedule at the end of my reasons. This constituted an increase of that statutory component by $1,000 from the amount which had been allowed by Mathews J. The reasons for that increase were explained in my reasons in these terms: "The relevant section in the [Motor Accidents Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) which governs quantification of non-economic loss is [s 79.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s79.html) That section reads: "79. (1) No damages shall be awarded for the noneconomic loss of an injured person as a consequence of a motor accident unless the injured person's ability to lead a normal life is significantly impaired by the injury suffered in the accident.

The amount of damages to be awarded for noneconomic loss shall be a proportion, determined according to the severity of the non-economic loss, of the maximum amount which may be awarded.

The maximum amount which may be awarded for non-economic loss is S180,000, but the maximum amount shall be awarded only in a most extreme case.
 .
The Minister shall, on or before 1 October 1990 and on or before 1 October in each succeeding year, declare, by order published in the Gazette, the amounts which are to apply, as from the date specified in the order, for the purposes of [section 79.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s79.html) ..." 
Mathews J awarded the highest sum available at the time of judgment to a "most extreme case", viz. $211,000. Between trial and appeal, the highest sum available was increased to $212,000. Following Marsland versus Andjelic (No. 1) [(1993) 31 NSWLR (CA)] at 165 and Nominal Defendant versus Mary Gardikiotis (Court of Appeal , 28 February 1994, unreported) (1994) NSWJB 44, and subject to the challenge to other aspects of her Honour's judgment, the judgment should be increased by $ 1,000 to reflect the increase in the highest sum available: Gardikiotis, per
Meagher JA at p. 9. It is understood that the High Court of 
Australia has given special leave to appeal in the Marsland case. However, until the rule is altered by the High Court or by Parliament, the holding in Marsland and Gardikiotis must be applied." 
An argument of double compensation contrary to the statute
After the publication of the reasons and orders of this Court, counsel for
Mr Nicholson drew attention to the fact that between the time of the argument of the appeal and the publication of the reasons and orders of the Court, the amount of the statutory allowance under the Act for the maximum for "a most extreme case" of non economic loss had been increased from $212,000 to $222,000.
Accordingly, it was submitted, that component of the judgment which
I proposed in my reasons should, by the logic of those reasons, be increased to $222,000 to reflect the then obtaining maximum.
Counsel for the defendants in written submissions to the Court, did not oppose the correction of the Court's orders to delete order 4 of the orders proposed by me in order to accommodate this further increase in the allowance under the [Motor Accidents Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) for non economic loss. A facility for corrections of this End had been reserved by order 6 of my original orders.
However, he did object to the retrospective operation of that component. He did so upon the basis that to provide interest on a sum which by statute was not payable until after 1 October 1994, would provide a form of double compensation to Mr Nicholson. It would constitute payment to him of the allowance made by the order published in The Gazette for the passage of time of inflationary and other considerations, whilst, as well, providing the plaintiff, by the terms of the order, interest back to the date of the original judgment of Mathews
J. This, it was argued, would not be just.
The issue which is thus presented to the Court is not without complications. The complications arise from artificialities imposed by [s 79](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s79.html) of the Act. That section sets a cap on the maximum amount that may be awarded for non economic loss. Fixing such a cap cannot of course, wish away the reality of the true economic loss which has been suffered by a plaintiff. The plaintiff in the present case would, had there been no statutory cap, have been entitled to recover at common law an amount for non economic loss considerably greater than $222,000. However, the amount fixed by Parliament must be conformed to. But that does not necessarily govern what should occur in respect of interest.
 
Reconciling past practice, the Policy of the Act and just provision of interest
Argument was heard by the Court in respect of the way in which this matter has been approached in the past. In Marsland versus Andjelic, the Court's orders substituted for the orders of Master Malpass, a sum larger than that which
Master Malpass had ordered. The Court did not, in terms, state that that sum should have taken effect from the date of Master Malpass' original orders.
Nevertheless, the Court has been informed, without contest, that the parties in Marsland versus Andjelic approached the matter as if the Court had ordered that the substituted sum should take effect from the date of the order of Master
Malpass. Thus, in Marsland versus Andjelic interest was paid on the increased judgment in its entirety, including upon the increased component for non economic loss, back to the date of the original judgment.
It is fair to say that no particular attention was paid by the Court to the point now before us. The matter is not the subject so far as I am aware, of any consideration by the Court. Nor may the parties in Marsland have given particular attention to the point. It now falls for decision.
Whilst I can understand the argument for Mr Nicholson that the allowance of $222,000 is already heavily discounted in his case and represents nothing more than an artificial statutory cap, and whilst consistent with what the
Court did in Marsland, Mr Nicholson would be entitled to have his judgment backdated to the date of Mathews J's orders with interest thereon for the full period since that time, it does not seem to me that this constitutes the proper application of the will of Parliament as expressed in [s 79](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s79.html) of the Act.
This section appears to contemplate that the Court will apply the statutory maximum. The statutory maximum will vary from time to time. The variation will be gazetted in the Government Gazette. Alterations will take effect from the date of gazettal, not retrospectively.
Against the background of that legislative scheme, it would not appear just that a plaintiff should be entitled to recover interest back-dated to the earlier date upon a sum which at that earlier date was not yet payable under the statute.
The key to unlocking the controversy which is now before the Court is, in my view, to be found in the discretion which is provided to the Court for the award of interest following judgment. That discretion is contained in <case> of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/). That section gives the Court a power to make orders which are proper to the particular circumstances. Conclusion: interest on the statutory maximum from time to time
In the present case the proper approach to the award of interest which will take into account the Court's finding that Mr Nicholson was entitled to substituted sums in place of those found by Mathews J, whilst at the same time taking into account the variation in the statutory allowance for non economic loss, involves the provision of interest in the normal way on all components of the judgment save the statutory component of non economic loss. Interest on the other components should be backdated to the date when the original judgment with those components added to them was notionally entered, ie, the date of the judgment of Mathews J. However, upon the statutory component in relation to non economic loss, as provided by the legislature, it would be appropriate to allow interest on that component by reference to what it was from time to time, ie, in this case the maximum of $211,000 until 30 September , $212,000 from 1 October 1993 to 30 September 1994, and $222,000 from 1
October 1994 to date of payment of the judgment.
I concede that this, in turn, involves an element of artificiality.
However, whatever the Court does in this case will be artificial. The Court should not be blamed for the artificiality. The responsibility for the decision to fix a semi arbitrary statutory cap should be laid at the door of
Parliament. It arises by reason of the provisions which Parliament has enacted in [ss 79](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s79.html) and [80](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s80.html) of the [Motor Accidents Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/).
This solution also lacks the neatness of the simple back-dated order as provided in Marsland versus Andjelic, as that order was apparently interpreted to operate. Nevertheless, it has the advantage of conforming to the will of
Parliament that, from time to time, the maximum amount for non economic loss allowed will be fixed and then varied.
The amount in question is not insubstantial in this case. It involves a variation of $10,000. The interest on that amount, even for a year, would be substantial. For two years it would be even more so. In many cases where the increase has been small, the variation would not delay the parties or the
Court.
However, in the present case, the problem having been presented, it seems appropriate, in the exercise of the Court's discretion to award interest to vary the orders accordingly.
The orders which I therefore propose pursuant to liberty reserved by the
Court are: Delete order 4 made by the Court on 8 December 1994. In lieu thereof, substitute for that component of the judgment for non economic loss $222,000. Order that the total judgment that should be entered in favour of the appellant be the sum of $2,209,930.
Add a further order 7 that interest shall be payable upon all components of the judgment of $2,209,930, save for the component of non economic loss of $212,000, as from the date of the original orders of Mathews J. Interest shall be payable on the amount for the non economic loss in accordance with the statutory maximum at rests determined by the terms of the Act as varied by the orders made and published in the
Gazette pursuant to [s 80](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s80.html) of the Act.
JUDGE2
MAHONEY JA The problem that arises in this case arises for reasons for which the President has referred. The
Court on 8 December 1984 made certain orders and gave reasons for them. However, the orders were not final orders. Liberty was reserved to re-argue other matters and it is accepted the matters in question, namely, the increase of the amount for non economic loss from $212,000 to $222,000 is within the limit referred to. Accordingly, the judgment which will now be given will be the final judgment of the Court.
On that basis the Court has awarded, in relation to non economic loss, the amount of $222,000 and the final judgment of the Court is for an amount which takes that into account in the manner to which the President has referred.
Ordinarily this would result in accordance with the practice of awarding interest under the Act and otherwise, in the judgment of the Court as so assessed being substituted for the judgment given by Mathews J. The judgment would take effect from the date her Honour gave judgment and interest would be payable accordingly from the date of that judgment upon the new amount substituted by this Court.
However,
Mr Hislop has taken a neat point. He has said this will result in a form of double award of damages. He has said the reason for the increase in the amount of non economic loss from $212,000 to $222,000 is that there has been an inflation of the currency and that the amount of $212,000 represents - and I expand his words by mine - the increase in the cost of goods and services. But he says, the award of interest or the purpose of awarding it is also to take account of the changes in the value of money. To award interest on the larger amount from the date of the judge's judgment is therefore to duplicate the award in question.
The argument is ingenious but, in my opinion, makes an assumption as to consistency in this area of the law which I would ordinarily not accept.
I have in previous cases expressed my view in relation to the reasons for the award of interest and I do not repeat those views.
I think it would be generally more consistent with the views I have expressed simply to allow the orders to take effect in accordance with the ordinary course, ie, to allow interest in the total amount of the judgment as given by this Court. That judgment includes, as I have said, the amount of $222,000 for non economic loss. I think that is more consistent with the views that I have previously expressed to allow interest on the judgment from the date on which it takes effect, viz, the date of the judge's judgment.

However, I am conscious of the fact that such a problem as this is apt to arise in the future. There will no doubt be cases in which the statutory rise in the non economic loss cap imposed by the legislature will result in changes in the amount of the judgment awarded in this Court as in the present case and will result in problems as to the interest to be allowed. In the interest of consistency of decision in this Court, I think I should agree with the orders which have been suggested by the President. This will show that (while the views in relation to the award of interest remain as they are) this Court will be consistent in the views it adopts in this regard.
For those reasons I therefore agree with the orders proposed by the
President.

MEAGHER JA So do I.
