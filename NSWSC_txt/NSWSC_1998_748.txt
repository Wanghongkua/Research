The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT (On application for bail) 
HIS HONOUR: Regrettably, I am unable to see my way clear to a grant of bail in the present case. I accept Mr. Gartelmann's submissions that it is open to me in law to grant bail, nonetheless the present applicant has been convicted on her own plea of guilty and sentenced to some 12 months imprisonment for a crime she insists on repeating. 
The conviction and sentence of a local court against which an appeal has been lodged is not a merely contingent thing. It remains as a valid and binding determination both as to guilt and as to sentence unless or until set aside on appeal. Any appeal in this case, I am told, is on severity only and in any event it would seem from the applicant's record and the circumstances of the plea that a gaol sentence extending well beyond the date on which the appeal might be disposed of is inevitable.

Bail is, however, sought on the basis that the applicant needs to care for siblings, or to make arrangements for siblings, and that some impediment exists to making those arrangements whilst in custody. Such a matter is a matter to which I can have regard but in the circumstances is most unpersuasive. There remains a brother, albeit that brother is engaged in full- time work at inconvenient hours, an ill father and a sister or step-sister who lives some distance away. But some effective family arrangement can be made, it seems to me, either by the applicant communicating from custody or by other members of the family taking it upon themselves to make some arrangements.

I cannot see that I should defer the operation of a validly passed sentence only subject to challenges to its extent in those circumstances.

Bail is refused.
