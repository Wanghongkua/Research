YOUNG CJ in EQ  
Wednesday 28 May 2008  /06 - VELLA versus ANNOUS 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: These proceedings were heard together with five other matters. The plaintiff, Alessio Vella, claims sums of money for money had and received as follows: as against the first defendant, Hassam Annous, $100,000; as against the second defendant, Rimridge Pty Ltd, $100,000; as against the third defendant, Vanessa Tsokos, $400,000; as against the fourth defendant, Dux Enterprises, $55,000; and as against the fifth, the Trustee of the bankrupt estate of A A
Caradonna, some $2 million.
 The matter has been settled as against the first, second and third defendants. The fourth defendant has not appeared and the fifth defendant has not taken any part in these proceedings.
 At the hearing, Mr M J Slattery QC, Mr D A Smallbone and Ms L Wilson appeared for the plaintiff, Mr S Burchett appeared for the first defendant and
Mr R D Marshall appeared for Mrs Tsokos.
 For reasons given in 4122/06, no orders need be made in these proceedings and I would think that at the short minutes stage they should simply be dismissed.
