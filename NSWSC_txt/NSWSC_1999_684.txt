No. 2971/99 
John Philip Teasdale and Janice Lorraine Welsford 
Plaintiff 
Australian Securities and Investments Commission 
Defendant 
JUDGMENT -- ex tempore  July 1999 In this matter I now give the reasons for the orders earlier made to reinstate Teasdale Roofing and Cladding Pty Limited pursuant to s601AH(2) of the Corporations Law and under s601AH(3) to validate certain payments and the incurrence of certain liabilities which occurred subsequent to the deregistration. It had been deregistered for failure to lodge annual returns, in circumstances where the Applicant, who was the company officer responsible gives evidence of his being in a state of acute depression. However, its financial position would be now in prospect of insolvency, if reinstated, unless salvageable as now proposed.
 The Applicant is, I am satisfied, "a person aggrieved" by the deregistration and thus entitled to seek reinstatement; see Needham J in Re Prosperpine Pty
Ltd (1980) CLC 34,277 at 34,279 citing the Privy Council in A-G of Gambia v
N'jie [(1961) AC 617] at 634 in these terms (subsequently applied by National
Trust of Australia (Vic) versus Australian Temperance & General Mutual Life
Assurance Society Ltd <case>; [(1976) VR 592] at 604-5): "The words `person aggrieved' are of wide import and should not be subjected to a restrictive interpretation. They do not include, of course, a mere busybody who is interfering in things which do not concern him: but they do include a person who has a genuine grievance because an order has been made which prejudicially affects his interests." He is a director, a principal shareholder and importantly a contingent creditor of the Company by virtue of a penalty notice served on him by the
Australian Taxation Office pursuant to s222AOC of the Income Tax Assessment
Act in relation to the Company's unpaid tax.
 I should add that the penalty notice post-dated deregistration but there is no evidence as to whether it was prompted by it.
 The Company is seeking to bring about a deed of company arrangement which the Applicant hopes will see the taxation debt and other debts compromised. It is based upon his contributing $80,000 to be utilised by the Administrator pursuant to a deed of company arrangement, yielding, it is said, some 40 cents in the dollar for creditors.
 Should these arrangements fail by reason of the Administrator being unsuccessful in those endeavours, it can be expected that the Company will be either again deregistered or liquidated. The undertakings in paragraph 3 are intended to ensure that ASIC is kept informed about the progress of the administration. This is in circumstances where ASIC has not opposed the present application and where the Taxation Department have taken no step to appear to-day, though informed of these proceedings.
