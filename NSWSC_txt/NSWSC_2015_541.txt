JUDGMENT - EX TEMPORE
HER HONOUR: I have this morning determined an application brought by a tenant who is obliged as a third party payer to pay its landlord's legal costs in connection with an admitted breach of the lease. For the reasons I have given orally this morning, the tenant has been successful in the proceedings in this Court, in particular in contending that it is entitled to have the landlord's costs assessed: Universal 1919 Pty Limited versus Barraket Stanton Lawyers Pty Ltd <case>
Ordinarily, costs follow the event. Mr Sharpe, who appears for the landlord and the solicitor, has argued that the "usual order" in an application under [s 350](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lpa2004179/s350.html) of the [Legal Profession Act 2004](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lpa2004179/) (presumably a reference to subs (5) of that section) is that the applicant pay the costs, even if successful. This proceeding, however, has not been determined as such an application. Rather, I have held that the application did not require a determination under [s 350(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lpa2004179/s350.html), since it was not brought out of time. The reason I determined it was not brought out of time was the landlord's or solicitor's failure to provide information in response to a proper written request.
The landlord and solicitor submitted that the only reason for the present application was the assessor's determination to the contrary. I would respectfully see the matter differently. In my view, the one event that could have obviated the unfortunate and expensive dispute that has transpired between these parties is that the landlord and solicitor could have acceded to any one of the many reasonable requests for information made by the tenant.
One further submission relied upon in resisting an order for costs was that if, in due course, it transpires that the figure claimed by the landlord is right, it would be unjust if the landlord and solicitor had to bear the costs of the present application. Again, I would reiterate that the step which would have obviated the costs of this application is the provision of the information sought from the outset.
In my view, the appropriate order is that the defendants pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.
