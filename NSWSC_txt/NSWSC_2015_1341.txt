EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
This is an application brought by summons filed in Court today by the plaintiff, the New South Wales Crime Commission, seeking orders pursuant to <case> of the Criminal Assets and Recovery Act 1990 ("the Act") in relation to keeping restrained persons from dealing with property, the property being that listed in Schedules 1 and 2 of the summons.
The owner of the relevant property specified is Milad Eid. Section 10A of the Act provides for applications of this nature to be heard ex parte and this application is proceeding on that basis.
Tendered by the Crime Commission and relied upon in support of the application is an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 7 September 2015. Mr Spark is the Director of Financial Investigations with the New South Wales Crime Commission and he is an authorised officer within the meaning of <case> of the Act. He is authorised in writing by the Commission to act as an authorised officer for the purposes of <case> and Pt 4 of the Act.
Mr Spark deposes that he has had access to material produced as a consequence of an investigation conducted by the New South Wales Police into the defendant and financial information relating to the defendant. Mr Spark suspects that the defendant has been engaged in serious crime related activities as defined by <case> of the Act being the commission of an offence of supply prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis contrary to [s 25A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25a.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/), together with further offences of supply prohibited drugs under [s 25(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of the same Act and another offence of knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime contrary to [s 193B(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s193b.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/). All of these offences are punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of, or exceeding, five years, and they fall within the definition of a serious criminal offence pursuant to <case>(b) of the Act.
Mr Spark has made inquiries with New South Wales Police and determined that the defendant was charged by police on 26 August 2015 subsequent to an investigation by police. The defendant is said to be an unemployed man who resides at an address in Minchinbury which he recently purchased for the sum of $675,000 notwithstanding his unemployed status. The New South Wales Police commenced an investigation into the ongoing supply of heroin in the Mount Druitt area in March 2015 in relation to co-accused and physical and electronic surveillance was employed. The defendant is one of the persons who came to the notice of police as a consequence of that surveillance.
The police have evidence to establish that the defendant has engaged in the business of supply heroin using a Land Rover Discovery motor vehicle registered to him. The co-accused regularly met with the defendant and would supply heroin in relation to the supply activity, with the defendant and other persons working in concert to distribute significant quantities of heroin to a large client base in the western Sydney area. The electronic surveillance which was conducted between 30 July 2015 and 26 August 2015 has recorded evidence of the defendant supplying heroin on a number of occasions sufficient to establish an ongoing supply per [s 25A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25a.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/), on each occasion receiving financial or other material reward.
The defendant was charged last month as noted and he is to appear before the Penrith Local Court on 25 September this year in answer to those charges.
Having read the evidentiary material tendered and relied upon by the plaintiff I am satisfied that the suspicion held by Mr Spark is reasonably held. Section 10A(5) of the Act requires the Court to make a restraining order if the Court concludes that the suspicions held by the authorised officer is reasonably held, as I have concluded in this case.
Accordingly I am prepared to make the orders sought by the plaintiff.
