JUDGMENT
Michael Robert Walsh ("the deceased") died on 16 December 2010.
The deceased left a Will dated 1 February 2007. Probate of his Will was granted to NSW Trustee and Guardian ("the Plaintiff") on 15 March 2011. The Defendant named in the Summons, Sophia Maree Gregory, is not a beneficiary named in the deceased's Will. 
The Plaintiff seeks the appointment of trustees for the sale of a property situated at Willmot, in NSW ("the Property"). It also seeks orders for vacant possession of the Property to be given to the trustees for sale and for the application of the proceeds of sale. As far as the Plaintiff is aware, the Defendant, only, remains in occupation of the Property.
The Defendant is a registered proprietor, with the deceased, of the Property, as tenants in common in equal shares.
The proceedings by the Plaintiff were commenced by originating Summons filed on 6 October 2011. The Summons was returnable before the Registrar on 8 November 2011. In support of the Summons, the following was filed: two consents to act as trustee, one by each proposed trustee, two affidavits verifying consent to act as trustee, one in respect of each proposed trustee, and one affidavit of fitness of the proposed trustees, in which reference was made to each of the proposed trustees. These affidavits have been read on the hearing today. 
There was no appearance on the return date, by, or on behalf of, the Defendant. There was also no appearance by, or on behalf of, the Defendant before me today (although the matter was called outside the court).
Personal service of the Summons was attempted on 22 October 2011, 30 October 2011, 2 November 2011, and 8 November 2011.
By Notice of Motion filed on 28 November 2011, the Plaintiff sought an order for substituted service pursuant to the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) ("UCPR") [rule 10.14.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s10.14.html) The Plaintiff relied on evidence of attempts to serve the Defendant, and on correspondence sent to her, neither of which elicited any response.
The Registrar made an order for substituted service on 16 December 2011. Orders were made that the originating process was to be served by sending a copy thereof by pre-paid post, addressed to the Defendant at the Property. The Plaintiff was also ordered to send a letter addressed to the Defendant, with the originating process, advising her of the date on which the matter was next listed for directions. The originating process was to be taken to have been served on the Defendant one week after the copy of the originating process was posted to the Defendant.
Adele Pamela Jarrett, a legal administrator in the employ of the Plaintiff's solicitors, swore an affidavit on 19 March 2012. She deposed to having "sent a letter to the Defendant by pre-paid post from Tamworth Post Office on 16 January 2012. She annexed a copy of a letter dated 16 January 2012 and says that the letter, the Summons in the proceedings and the order of the court dated 16 December 2011 were included in the envelope that she posted. She also stated the envelope included a return address and that neither the letter, nor the envelope, had been returned.
Had that affidavit been the only source of proof of service of the Summons on the Defendant, I would not have been satisfied of proof of service by post. 
However, in an affidavit sworn on 23 April 2012, a process server stated that, on 28 March 2012, he left a copy of the Summons, the judgment/order dated 16 December 2011 and a letter in the letterbox at the Property.
In an affidavit sworn on 15 May 2012, by Ms Jarrett, the letter referred to in the preceding paragraph was identified as one dated 26 March 2012. She stated that she had sent the original of that letter to the process server for service on the Defendant. The letter referred to the matter being listed before the Registrar at 9:00 a.m. on 9 May 2012. The letter also stated the address of the court where the Registrar usually sits.
Annexed to the affidavit of Ms Jarrett of 15 May 2012, there was also a copy letter dated 12 May 2012 from ZuckerLegal, the Plaintiff's solicitors, to the Defendant, at the address of the Property. There is admissible evidence of service of the letter by post. Service is taken to have been effected one week after the documents were sent by post (19 May 2012).
An affidavit of another process server sworn on 23 April 2012, also evidenced service of the Summons and other documents, by leaving a copy thereof at the Property.
Finally there are two further affidavits of service, one by Ms Jarrett sworn on 12 June 2012 and one by Mr Zucker, the Plaintiff's solicitor, also of 12 June 2012, deposing to further service, by post of documents upon the Defendant. Documents included a letter informing the Defendant that the matter was listed for hearing today and that the Plaintiff would seek orders.

Hearing in the absence of a Party [Rule 29.7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s29.7.html) of the UCPR, relevantly, provides: "29.7 Procedure to be followed if party is absent 
This rule applies when a trial is called on.

If any party is absent, the court: may proceed with the trial generally or so far as concerns any claim for relief in the proceedings, or may adjourn the trial.
 ..."
The clear purpose of UCPR [rule 29.7](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s29.7.html) is the efficient dispatch of court business. However, in dispatching court business, I cannot ignore the right of a defendant to be informed, or, at least, to be made aware, of a trial date. It is a fundamental principle that a party who may be adversely affected by the making of court orders has a right to be heard: Cameron versus Cole  <case>; [(1944) 68 CLR 571], in which Rich J said (at 589): "It is a fundamental principle of natural justice, applicable to all courts whether superior or inferior, that a person against whom a claim or charge is made must be given a reasonable opportunity of appearing and presenting his case. If this principle be not observed, the person affected is entitled, ex debito justitiae, to have any determination which affects him set aside, and a court which finds that it has been led to purport to determine a matter in which there has been a failure to observe the principle has inherent jurisdiction to set its determination aside. ... In such a case there has been no valid trial at all."
In the circumstances, the first issue to address is whether I am satisfied that it is appropriate to proceed in the absence of the Defendant or of anyone representing her.
A party is "absent" within the meaning of the rule, when the trial is called on, only if it can be shown that he, or she, has knowledge, or notice, of the date of the trial, and is not physically present, or not represented. In other words, before the rule can be relied upon, there should be proof that the absent party has been given reasonable notice of, or has knowledge of, the date of the trial.
Having read the evidence of service, some of which I have set out, I am now satisfied that all reasonable attempts have been taken to notify the Defendant of the Plaintiff's intention to obtain orders when the matter was listed before me today. Overall, I am satisfied that attempts have been made, fruitlessly, to get in contact with the Defendant, to provide her with the documents to be relied upon, and to allow her to participate in the proceedings. The Plaintiff has also established that all reasonable attempts to notify the Defendant of the date for the trial and that it was to then proceed have been made.
Finally, on the question, I have not forgotten what I said in Smirski versus Macander  <case> at <case>: "34 It is to be remembered that the primary considerations on whether to proceed ex parte concern whether there is urgency; whether irreparable damage would flow from making an ex parte order; whether hardship would flow to a party against whom an order is made and whether such an order can be set aside: Ndjamba versus Toyota Finance Australia Ltd <case>, per
Blokland J at [8]."
No particular urgency is disclosed. However, the deceased died 18 months ago and the Plaintiff cannot finally administer or distribute the estate until the deceased's interest in the Property is realised. The proceedings were commenced over six months ago and significant attempts have been made to have the Defendant take part. Finally, because of the form of orders proposed, the Defendant will not suffer irreparable harm if orders are made today. She will be allowed an opportunity to consider the orders and take such steps as she is advised. Whilst, of course, there may be some hardship for the Defendant in having to move out of the Property, there is no evidence that she would suffer such hardship. In any event, in my view, she has had some time to arrange her affairs. 
No application for an adjournment of the trial having been made by, or on behalf of, the Defendant, and being satisfied that the Defendant was, or should have been, aware of the Court date, and also that the trial would be proceeding, there is no ground on which it would be appropriate for the court to adjourn the trial. Thus, there would be no point in the Court, of its own motion, adjourning the matter, and I have proceeded to hear the matter in the absence of the Defendant.

Appointment of Trustees for Sale
The Plaintiff must prove the claim so far as the burden of proof lies upon it and if it proves its claim is entitled to the relief claimed and such other relief as is consistent therewith: Re Anton Fabrications Pty Ltd; Bentley Smythe Pty Ltd versus Anton Fabrications Pty Ltd  <case>, per Ward J, at [11].
So far as is relevant, [s 66G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing Act 1919](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/), provides: "(1) Where any property (other than chattels) is held in co-ownership the court may, on the application of any one or more of the co-owners, appoint trustees of the property and vest the same in such trustees, subject to incumbrances affecting the entirety, but free from incumbrances affecting any undivided shares, to be held by them on the statutory trust for sale or on the statutory trust for partition.

Subject to this section, on the death of a co-owner, any proceedings by or against the co-owner under subsection (1) (whether instituted before or after the commencement of this subsection) survive against or for the benefit of the estate of the deceased co-owner despite, in the case of a joint tenancy, the rule of survivorship.

Where the entirety of the property is vested in trustees or personal representatives, those trustees or personal representatives shall, unless the court otherwise determines, be appointed trustees on either of such statutory trusts, but subject, in the case of personal representatives, to their rights and powers for the purposes of administration.
 (a) Where the entirety of the property is vested at law in co-owners the court may appoint a trust corporation either alone or with one or two individuals (whether or not being co-owners), or two or more individuals, not exceeding four (whether or not including one or more of the co-owners), to be trustees of the property on either of such statutory trusts.

On such appointment the property shall, subject to the provisions of [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s78.html) of the [Trustee Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/), vest in the trustees.
 ...

In relation to the sale or partition of property held in co-ownership, the court may alter such statutory trusts, and the trust so altered shall be deemed to be the statutory trust in relation to that property.

Where property becomes subject to such statutory trust for sale: in the case of joint tenancy, a sale under the trust shall not of itself effect a severance of that tenancy, in any case land shall be deemed to be converted upon the appointment of trustees for sale unless the court otherwise directs.
 ..."
The court's jurisdiction to appoint trustees depends upon the Property being held in "co-ownership" and, generally, an application being made by one, or more, of the co-owners.
It will be appreciated that the Plaintiff is not a registered owner of the Property. 
However, [s 66F(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66f.html) of the [Conveyancing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/), for the purposes of Div 6 of [Pt 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/index.html#p4), which deals with statutory trusts of Property held in co-ownership, relevantly, provides that "co-ownership" means "ownership whether at law or in equity in possession by two or more persons as joint tenants or as tenants in common; ...".
The "statutory trust for sale" is defined by [s 66F(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66f.html) in the following terms: "Property held upon the 'statutory trust for sale' shall be held upon trust to sell the same and to stand possessed of the net proceeds of sale, after payment of costs and expenses, and of the net income until sale after payment of costs, expenses, and outgoings, and in the case of land of rates, taxes, costs of insurance, repairs properly payable out of income, and other outgoings upon such trusts, and subject to such powers and provisions as may be requisite for giving effect to the rights of the co-owners".
The question, then, is whether the Plaintiff is a "co-owner".
Section 44 of the Probate & Administration Act 1898 relevantly provides that upon the grant of probate of the will of any person dying after the passing of that Act, all real and personal estate which any such person dies seised or possessed of, or entitled to, in New South Wales, shall as from the death of such person pass to and become vested in the executor to whom probate has been granted.
Importantly, [s 66G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) does not require the party seeking the relief to be a registered proprietor of the property the subject of the application. What is required is that the applicant be a co-owner.
It follows, in my view, that upon obtaining the grant of Probate in March 2011, the deceased's interest in the Property vested in the Plaintiff from the date of death (December 2010). Accordingly, it is a "co-owner". 
Whilst an order under [s 66G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) is discretionary (see, for example, Matsen versus Matsen  <case> at <case>, per Hamilton J; National Australia Bank Ltd versus Pasupati  <case>, at [20], per Buddin J), the courts have declined to offer any comprehensive definition of the kinds of matters which would lead the court to decline to grant such an order.
However, in Ngatoa versus Ford  <case>. His Honour added, in Matsen versus Matsen, at [62], that "the courts have held that an agreement limiting the manner in which a person may dispose of his or her interest as a co- owner may provide a ground for refusal of an application for an order under [s 66G".](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html)
In Tory versus Tory <case>, at [42], White J referred to various authorities and said that an order under [s 66G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) "is almost as of right unless on settled principles it would be inequitable to allow the application". His Honour also observed that an application would be refused if making the order would be inconsistent with a proprietary right or contractual or fiduciary obligation or might be refused on the basis of conventional estoppel or equitable estoppel. 
In Ross versus Ross <case>, at [36], the discretion to refuse relief under [s 66G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) was described as "a limited one".
In Joseph versus Agrey  <case>, White J expressed a similar view, saying: "It is only in exceptional circumstances that co-owners are not entitled to an order under [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) for appointment of trustees for sale."
Also see, Pascoe versus Dyason <case> in which Black J reviewed the authorities. His Honour said: "5. The purpose of this section is 'to provide a mechanism for terminating the co-ownership [of property] where the co-owners themselves cannot agree on how the co-ownership should be determined': P Butt, Land Law , 6 th ed, 2010 at
In Callahan versus O'Neill  <case>,
Young CJ in Eq observed: 'It is fairly clear that, as a general rule, any co-owner holding at least 50% of a parcel of real property is entitled almost as of right to an order for partition or sale under [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/). It is only in situations where it would, under settled principles, be inequitable to permit such an application, including cases where there has been a contract not to make an application that the order may be refused. This appears from cases such as Ngatoa versus Ford [(1990) 19 NSWLR 72] and
Williams versus Legg [(1993) 29 NSWLR 687.']
Although the Court has a discretion whether or not to make an order under this section, the grounds on which the Court will ordinarily refuse to make it are limited. For example, if it is inconsistent with a proprietary right or a contractual or fiduciary obligation, and there is no general jurisdiction to refuse to grant such an order on the basis of hardship or unfairness:
Stephens versus Debney [(1960) 60 SR 468];
Re McNamara and the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) [(1961) 78
WN 1068]; Ngatoa versus Ford [(1990) 19 NSWLR 72]; Williams v Legg [(1993) 29 NSWLR 687]; Westpac
Banking Corporation versus Sansom (1994) 6 BPR 13,790; Woodson (Sales) Pty Ltd v
Woodson (Aust) Pty Ltd [(1996) 7 BPR 14,685.] In
Hogan versus Baseden (1997) 8 BPR 15,723 at 15,723, Mason P observed that it 'would not be a proper exercise of discretion of the power to decline relief under [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) ... to refuse an application on grounds of hardship or general unfairness.'
His Honour also noted that: '[I]n the unhappy event that the parties are unable to settle their differences then the making of an order appointing trustees for sale seems inevitable unless the respondent could establish a legally binding agreement not to put her out of occupation of her home, or circumstances that would ground some estoppel to similar effect.' (at <case> at <case>- [18], McLaughlin AsJ observed that, where a plaintiff and defendant are registered as tenants in common in equal shares, then prima facie the plaintiff is entitled to relief by way of an order under [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) for sale of the relevant property and for the division of the net proceeds of such sale between the plaintiff and the defendant in equal shares. It was for the defendant, who denied the plaintiff's entitlement to such relief, to establish that the legal rights of the parties consequent upon their status as registered proprietors as tenants in common in equal shares were in some way altered by the invocation of equitable rights recognised by a Court of Equity or that there was some other reason why the Court should, in the exercise of the limited discretion reposed in it by [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/), decline to make an appointment of statutory trustees for sale of the subject property.
In Cain versus Cain [[2007] NSWSC 623] at [[9]](/cgi- bin/LawCite?cit=%5b2007%5d%20NSWSC%20623#para9)- [10], Young CJ in Eq noted that the Court will usually consider it appropriate to make an order under [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) unless persuaded by cogent arguments from those who oppose. His Honour then noted
Counsel's summary of the categories of cases in which the Court has declined to grant such an order as including: where the legal title is held by trustees and the trust instrument contains its own procedure for sale; where the plaintiff's conduct rates as an estoppel against the sale; and where an order would be incompatible with a contractual or equitable duty binding the applicant. In Tory versus Tory <case> at <case>,
White J noted that an order under [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) 'is almost as of right unless on settled principles it would be inequitable to allow the application', and observed that an application would be refused if making the order would be inconsistent with a proprietary right or contractual or fiduciary obligation or on the basis of conventional estoppel or equitable estoppel. In Spathis versus Nanos  <case> at <case>- [20], Jagot AJ observed that the discretion was not at large and is not to be exercised by reference to personal views about hardship or unfairness. The
Court of Appeal also noted that the discretion to refuse relief under [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) of the [Conveyancing
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) was a 'limited one' in Ross versus Ross <case> at <case>; see also National Australia Bank Ltd versus Pasupati <case> at <case>."
That case was referred to with approval by Stevenson J in Dixon as Trustee of the Bankrupt Estate of Badillo-Watiwat versus Watiwat <case> at <case>. 
Finally, Ball J in Forrest versus Nix <case>, at [44] noted: "44The general principle is that a co-owner is entitled to an order under [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html) "almost as of right": Callahan versus O'Neill  <case> at <case> per
Young CJ in Eq; Chalhoub versus Chalhoub  <case> at <case> per McLaughlin AsJ; Tory versus Tory <case> at <case> per
White J. However, that statement of general principle is normally restricted to cases where the applicant for an order has at least a 50 percent interest in the property. Moreover, although it is doubtful that the parties can by agreement exclude the operation of [s
G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66g.html), a court may decline to make an order where the parties have entered into an agreement that binds them to deal with the property in a certain way: Ngatoa v Ford [(1990) 19 NSWLR 72]; Chalhoub v Chalhoub  <case>;
Tory versus Tory [[2007] NSWSC ."](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2007/1078.html "View
Case" )
The discretion is not to be exercised by reference to personal views about hardship or unfairness: Hogan versus Baseden (1997) 8 BPR 15,723, at 15,723, per Mason P; Spathis versus Nanos <case> at <case> per Jagot AJ. Furthermore, the party opposing sale has the onus of dissuading the Court from ordering a trust for sale (Woodson (Sales) Pty Limited versus Woodson (Australia) Pty Limited [(1996) 7 BPR 14,685] per Nicholas J at [19].
In this case, no evidence going to any matter which would dissuade me from ordering the sale of the Property has been advanced. 
The court has a complete discretion as to who it will appoint to conduct a sale. In Crocombe versus Pine Forests of Australia Pty Ltd <case>; [(2005) 219 ALR 692], Young CJ in Eq (as his Honour then was) said at [88]: "A procedure has grown up in connection with sales ordered by the Court. The
Court has a complete discretion as to who it will appoint to conduct a sale, being guided by how the Court considers it most beneficial to the estate, though ordinarily the conduct of the sale is given to the plaintiff even though the plaintiff may not have the greatest interest in the property; see eg Dixon versus Pyner <case>; [(1850) 7 Hare 331] ; [68 ER 135]; Dale versus Hamilton (1853) 10 Hare Appendix 1 vii; <case>; <case>; [(1918) 18 SR 259."], Young CJ in Eq (as his Honour then was) said at [21]: "When deciding upon trustees for sale, where there is no consent, four factors usually need to be considered by the court. These are, in no particular order of importance; (1) the principle that the court tends to prefer the preference of the person with the greater interest in the land. ... (2) the trustees should be independent and as free from conflict of interests as possible. ...
the trustees, particularly where they have more active duties than merely to sell a piece of real estate, should have the appropriate skill, expertise and experience; and (4) the court should endeavour to get the best value for the parties' money and see that as between two equally alternative proposals the cheaper is preferred."
In my opinion, it is appropriate to appoint the trustees sought by the Plaintiff.
[Section 66H](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/s66h.html) of the [Conveyancing Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/) regulates the power of sale. The trustees have all the "ordinary duties and obligations of trustees" (Application of Richard Albarran; Harb versus Harb <case> at <case>, per Brereton J) and must comply with the requirements of the section including the requirement to consult all beneficiaries who are 18 years or older and not subject to any legal disability. However, as was said in Harb versus Harb at [14],the "requirement that it imposes is one to give effect to the wishes of the beneficiaries or the majority of them by value 'so far as consistent with the general interests of the trust'. Thus, if the wishes of the beneficiaries are inconsistent with the general interests of the trust, the trustee is not obliged to give effect to those wishes".
The final issue relates to whether an order for possession should be made. Clearly, to enable the sale of the Property, if that occurs, vacant possession will be required by the trustees for sale. There is no suggestion of any person, other than the Defendant, in occupation of the Property.
No reason has been advanced for not making an order for sale now, although, without opposition from the Plaintiff, I shall allow a period of 29 days for a writ of possession to be executed.
I am satisfied that the orders sought by the Plaintiff should be made. I shall, without opposition by the Plaintiff, allow one further opportunity to the Defendant to see if she can come to some suitable arrangement with the Plaintiff in order to avoid the costs of the trustees for sale and the costs of sale. It may be possible for her to avoid the writ of possession issuing, but that will be a matter for her to raise with the Plaintiff. In this regard, 21 days should be sufficient.
Mr Zucker has provided proposed Short Minutes of Order which I have considered. I make the following orders: 
Order that Kenneth John Fairfax, solicitor, and Timothy Joseph Ring, chartered accountant, be appointed trustees of all the land in Folio
