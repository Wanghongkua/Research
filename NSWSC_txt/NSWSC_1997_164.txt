Mark Bingham Nominees Pty Ltd versus Iona Corporation Pty Ltd and Ors [1997]
NSWSC 164 (28 April 1997) `MARK BINGHAM NOMINEES PTY LTD versus IONA CORPORATION PTY LTD & ORS` ``3991/95 
MONDAY 28 APRIL 1997 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
YOUNG J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an application to wind up the second defendant Coachland Pty Ltd. The application is made by a contributory on the just and equitable ground. The plaintiff holds 10 per cent of the shares and the third defendant, Mr L G Melbourne, holds 90 per cent of the shares. The company was incorporated to carry out a restaurant business. That is now impossible because of the loss of the premises on which the restaurant was to be conducted and the falling out between the shareholders.

The substratum of the company having failed and the company not able to operate, it is just and equitable that it be wound up.

Mr Hugh Jenner Wily, one of the "A" list liquidators, is liquidator of one of the two associated companies. He has consented to act as liquidator if the court thinks fit to appoint him, and it seems to me that there would be a saving in costs and no problem with conflict if this occurred.

Accordingly, the court orders that the second defendant Coachland Pty Ltd be wound up and appoints Hugh Jenner Wily as its liquidator. Leave to the plaintiffs to apply for an order for costs should they be so advised.
