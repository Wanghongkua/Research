JUDGMENT (ex tempore) HIS HONOUR: Mr Insall SC for the plaintiff submits that the defendant's application for a stay of the operation of the order that I previously made -for return to the plaintiff of the deposit forthwith upon the plaintiff giving up possession of the land to the defendant - should be not heard, on the basis of what was said by Hutley JA in Permewan Wright Consolidated Pty
Ltd versus Attorney-General [(1978) 35 NSWLR 365], 369, to be a fundamental rule that a party guilty of contempt should not be heard in respect of an application made on his part.
 His Honour cited Cottenham LC in Chuck versus Cremer <case>; [(1846) 1 Coopt Cott 205], where his Lordship said (at 206; 820, emphasis added): ... [he] was not generally entitled to take a proceeding in the cause for his own benefit. That there were exceptions to the last rule, but they were few in number.
 There is much to be said for the view that the rule to which his Honour referred is in fact discretionary and not absolute [Hadkinson versus Hadkinson [[1952] P 285](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1952%5d%20P%20285 "View LawCiteRecord" ), 298 (Denning LJ); X Ltd versus Morgan-Grampian (Publishers) Ltd [[1991] 1 AC ], 46-47;
Fahmi & Fahmi <case>; [(1995) 19 Fam LR 517]; KP Cable Investments Pty Limited versus Meltglow Pty Ltd <case>; [(1995) 56 FCR 189]; AN versus Zhu <case>; [(2006) FLC 93-257], [74]-[79],[120]]. There is also much to be said for the view that even if the rule is an absolute one, the exceptions to which it is plainly subject [Hadkinson versus Hadkinson, 288-9 (Romer LJ); Permewan Wright v
Attorney-General, 367 (Reynolds JA), 374 (Mahoney JA)] include the circumstance in which an application is made to stay the operation of the very order in respect of which the contempt is said to have arisen. In Young v
Jackman [(1986) 7 NSWLR 97], Young J (as his Honour, the Chief Judge in Equity, then was) was greatly attracted to the fact that the rule was discretionary, but ultimately decided that in New South Wales it was an absolute rule until the Court of Appeal otherwise determined (at 101-102). In Leaway Pty Ltd v
Newcastle City Council (No 2) <case>; [(2005) 220 ALR 757], Campbell J (as his Honour then was) appears to have left open whether the rule is discretionary or not (at [59]).
 I should not, on an application of this type, in the short confines in which it has to be determined, depart from what the Chief Judge has said, without much closer consideration than is now possible. But in my view, I am not required to do so: I am relieved of that course by at least two circumstances.
The first is the effect of Uniform Civil Procedure Rules, r 36.5, which provides that if an order requires a person to do an act forthwith on a specified event, the Court may by order require the person to do the act within a specified time. As the annotation to that rule in Ritchie's Uniform
Civil Procedure NSW points out (at [36.5.5]), while an omission to fix the time does not make the order ineffectual, until it is fixed by a subsequent order, it is unenforceable (at least by committal or sequestration). [Gilbert v Endean [(1878) 9 Ch D 259]; Carter v Roberts [[1903] 2 Ch 312].] This was an order which required the defendant to do an act forthwith on a specified event, namely upon the plaintiff giving up possession of the premises. The defendant would not be liable to be dealt with for contempt, unless and until the Court had, by order pursuant to r 36.5, fixed a time for compliance with the order.
 Secondly, before the time for compliance with the order arrived, the defendant had sought the plaintiff's consent to a stay, and indicated that if that consent were not forthcoming by 28 July it would apply for such a stay.
Consent was not forthcoming, and although a formal Notice of Motion for a stay was not then filed, arrangements were made with my chambers that day for the relisting of the matter today to consider an application for a stay. Only at .55pm that evening did the plaintiff formally communicate its delivery up of possession that day and demand return of the deposit.
 An application for a stay having, in effect, been notified prior to the trigger for performance of the order by which the defendant was bound, it seems to me that the Court would not in those circumstances regard the defendant as in contempt. In any event, I am not plainly satisfied on a prima facie basis that the defendant should be regarded as in contempt.
 In those circumstances, I decline to refuse to hear the defendant's application.
