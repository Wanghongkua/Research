Monday 16 February 2009 /09 - GABRIELLE MAAS versus SMITH and SECURITY INDUSTRY NEW SOUTH WALES  
JUDGMENT  HIS HONOUR: Listed before the court is a notice of motion brought by
Gabrielle Marie Maas which nominates as defendants Mr Smith and Security
Industry New South Wales. It does appear that Mr Smith is the registrar of the security industry body. Ms Maas seeks various forms of relief, some of it is injunctive relief, in respect of which she claims are defamatory statements about her by the registrar. I have pointed out to Ms Maas that there is no appropriate jurisdictional foundational document filed by her at this stage.
She apparently appeared before the Duty Judge last week and was given short service leave in respect of this notice of motion. Despite that order, that would not cure the difficulties that presently exist.
 As has been pointed out by Mr McDonald, who appeared on the instructions of the Crown solicitor, the nominated second defendant is incorrect. In any event, the complaint fundamentally made by Ms Maas is remedial pursuant to the operative statute, whereby she could appeal to the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal. Ms Maas apparently recognises that, but indicates that she came to this court because she thought it might be a little quicker. Other relief sought under the notice of motion includes relief pursuant to the Human
Rights Act of the ACT and the [Anti-Discrimination Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/). There is also reference to the [Defamation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/da197499/). How its former existence be of relevance is not entirely clear now.
 These proceedings are entirely misconceived. It is clear that there is no merit involved and I propose summarily to dismiss the notice of motion and I so order. In the circumstances I don't propose to make an order for costs and exercise my discretion accordingly.
