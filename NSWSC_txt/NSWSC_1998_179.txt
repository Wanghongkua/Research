JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: 
Introduction 
On 7 June 1996, in proceedings 50180 of 1995, ("the 1995 proceedings"), I determined an issue of construction of an agreement propounded by the parties, to which I shall refer as Urica and Sanderson respectively. I invited them to bring in Short Minutes of Order to give effect to my reasons and, on 28 June , I made declarations, which gave effect to that construction, and ordered that paragraphs 1 to 4 and 6 and 7 in the Summons be dismissed with costs. On October 1997 the Court of Appeal allowed an appeal against my decision; set aside the declarations I had made; in lieu thereof made certain declarations as to the proper construction of the agreement; and ordered:- "4. Remit the matter to Rolfe J to make such further orders sought in the Summons filed on 19 September 1995 as may be appropriate; . The respondent to pay the appellant's costs of the appeal but to have a certificate under the [Suitors Fund Act 1951](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/) if so qualified." 
The 1995 proceedings and proceedings 50080 of 1997, which are between the same parties, ("the 1997 proceedings"), came before me on 30 and 31 March and 1
April 1998 and, on 27 April 1998, I delivered my reasons for judgment in both proceedings and, once again, invited the parties to bring in Short Minutes to give effect to my conclusions.

One issue raised was that the only issues before me in the 1995 proceedings were those contained in paragraphs 5, 8 and 9 of the Summons in those proceedings, because the Court of Appeal had not set aside the judgment in favour of Sanderson in respect of paragraphs 1 to 4, 6 and 7. I did not agree with that submission for reasons set forth at pp.15 and 16 of my judgment. I shall assume, for present purposes, that the reader has available my judgments of 7 June 1996 and 27 April 1998, and that of the Court of Appeal of 2 October .

The parties brought in Short Minutes in relation to each of the proceedings.
One issue has arisen, viz what order for costs I should make in respect of the proceedings. The Short Minutes provided that Sanderson should pay Urica's costs after 28 June 1996, i.e. the day on which I have judgment. However, Mr
V.F. Kerr of Counsel for Urica has submitted that the order should be in the following terms:- "The defendant" (Sanderson) "pay the plaintiff's" (Urica's) "costs of these proceedings including that part of the proceedings heard by Rolfe J in June 1996 and repay to the plaintiff the sum of $27,003.24 being the amount paid by the plaintiff to the defendant in respect of the defendant (sic) costs of that part of the proceedings." 
Mr J.M. Ireland of Queen's Counsel for Sanderson submitted that the more fulsome order for which Mr Kerr contended would conflict with the costs' order
I made on 28 June 1996. Mr Kerr submitted that it is appropriate that Urica should have its costs of these proceedings because it had been successful before the Court of Appeal and, therefore, should have its costs at first instance before me. The difficulty with this is that the Court of Appeal did not deal with those costs, but only the costs of the appeal. The question must be whether the remitter is wide enough to cover those costs.

The present position is:- 
Sanderson was successful before me and received an order for its costs against Urica on 28 June 1996.

Urica was successful in the Court of Appeal and Sanderson was ordered to pay Urica's costs of the appeal.

The Court of Appeal did not interfere with the order for costs I had made in favour of Sanderson.

I am now asked by Urica to change that order, which Sanderson contests on the basis that the order has been passed and entered and I cannot make another and inconsistent order.

I can see no problem with making an order for costs in the 1995 proceedings in favour of Urica as from 28 June 1996. There is no subsisting order for costs to cover that period and, as Urica has been successful, I see no reason why it should not have its costs of that period.

The question is whether the remitter by the Court of Appeal entitles me, in making "such further orders ... as may be appropriate", to set aside the order for costs I made and make a different one. In my opinion, the remitter was for the purpose of enabling orders consequential upon the Court of Appeal's construction of the agreement to be made. I consider that is wide enough to enable me to make the order for costs, which I consider appropriate for the period before 28 June 1996 based on the conclusion to which that Court came.
It was obviously open to the Court of Appeal to have made such an order.
However, their Honours may have taken the view that the construction they adopted did not necessarily mean that Urica should have its costs at first instance, and that that matter could not be determined until the other issues had been resolved. I think that is the better view and hence, essentially for the reasons I have given in relation to the other matters remitted, the intention was that I should also decide that question of costs. I propose to do so by making an order essentially in the terms of Mr Kerr's draft.

I am informed that an application will be made to the Court of Appeal by
Sanderson for leave to appeal from my most recent decision and, when that is done, this further question can be ventilated. I have made clear my view, for whatever benefit it may be to the Court of Appeal, that I can see no reason why Sanderson should not pay Urica's costs of the 1995 proceedings up to and including 28 June 1996 and thereafter.

I order that:- the order for costs made in favour of Sanderson Computers Pty Limited on June 1996 be set aside; 
Sanderson Computers Pty Limited pay the costs of Urica Library Systems BV of these proceedings; 
Sanderson Computers Pty Limited repay to Urica Library Systems BV $27,003.24 being the amount paid in respect of Sanderson Computer Pty
Limited's costs pursuant to the order made on 28 June 1996.
