 ` 
Wheelhouse versus The Public Trustee` ` 3850/95` `23 May 1997` `Young J` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division` /95 - WHEELHOUSE versus THE PUBLIC TRUSTEE 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is an application under the [Family Provision Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/fpa209/) in respect of the estate of the late Rodney Wayne Dwyer, who died on 14 August 1991 intestate. A grant of letters of administration was made to the Public Trustee on 7 April 1993. The present value of the estate as at today's date after all expenses and other costs of these proceedings have been paid is approximately $168,000, plus some land worth about $30,000. The deceased appears to have been survived by (a) his wife with whom he had only lived in Thailand for approximately two weeks in 1986 and whose whereabouts, despite extensive enquiries by the Public Trustee are unknown, and (b) a daughter, who was born to the deceased and a Ms Wheelhouse on 9 March 1987. The daughter makes a claim to the whole of the estate under the Act. 
The summons was filed on 9 October 1995. That is approximately two and half years after it should have been filed. The only evidence is that the mother of the daughter was of limited means and she was concerned that the litigation might be expensive, especially in view of the missing wife and she thought her only hope of making an application on behalf of the daughter was through Legal
Aid. She says the Legal Aid authorities took an extremely long time to process the application and then refused it.

I have recently dealt with the principles on which extension of time is granted and it is probably better not to revisit that. In the instant case applying those principles, even though there is a long period to be taken into account, the circumstances of the mother and the circumstances of the estate make it just to extend the period.

So far as the merits of the claim are concerned, the plaintiff is the only real claimant in view of the fact that despite extensive efforts the wife has not been able to be found. The plaintiff is currently 10 years of age. She has a small capital sum, which was put aside for her by the deceased but she will have needs which cannot be met by the income of her mother, who is receiving a modest income from the pension and is saving a little but not very much.
Accordingly, it is appropriate that the plaintiff receive the whole of the estate.

The orders will be that I extend the time for making application until the filing of the summons. I order that the Public Trustee is to hold the whole of the net estate on trust for the plaintiff. That, in practice, will mean that the Public Trustee will pay the plaintiff the capital when she attains 18. In the meantime, he will put out the capital to interest with the [Trustee
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/ta122/) provisions as to the meeting of any expenses that may be necessary for the education, et cetera, of the child but otherwise retaining the income. The costs of both parties should be paid out of the estate on the indemnity basis. This is the appropriate order when a pensioner mother makes application on behalf of an infant.
