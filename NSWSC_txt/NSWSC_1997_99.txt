TRADE PRACTICES COMMISSION versus COLLINGS CONSTRUCTION CO P/L & 5 ORS /94 
Tuesday, 10 December 1996 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COMMERCIAL DIVISION 
HUNTER J 
REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
A. Nature and History of Application 
HIS HONOUR: These proceedings were initiated by the Trade Practices Commission, now the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (the Commission), in the Federal Court in proceedings number G687 of 1993 (the Federal Court proceedings) seeking relief under [ss 80](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s80.html), [87](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s87.html)(1B) and [87](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s87.html)(1A) of the [Trade Practices Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) (Cth) (the Act) against Collings Construction Co Pty Ltd (Collings Construction), its director, Wayne Collings (Collings), Venture Industries Pty Ltd (Venture), and its managing director, Harry Kioussis (Kioussis), seeking permanent injunctive relief, declaratory orders, damages and interlocutory injunctive relief against all respondents. The Commission's application instituting the Federal Court proceedings was filed on 2 September 1993. The claim for damages in that application was made pursuant to [s 87(1A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s87.html) on behalf of Michael Charles Tanti (Tanti) and Wendy Joy Tanti (W Tanti) (the Tantis), Ashleigh Ian Ferris (Ferris) and Denise Ferris (D Ferris) (the Ferrises), Frank Quaglia (Quaglia) and Josephine Quaglia (J Quaglia) (the Quaglias), Ken John Smith (Smith) and Lesley Lorraine Smith (L Smith) (the Smiths) (the original owners).

Pursuant to consent orders made by Wilcox J on 15 December 1993, leave was granted to amend the application in terms of the amended application filed 17
December 1993 by which Peter John Corbett (Corbett ) and Alison Marie Corbett (A Corbett) (the Corbetts), Alan Grimston (Grimston) and Sharon Grimston (S
Grimston) (the Grimstons) and Jacobus Petrus Gerardus Stap (Stap) and Nicole
Louise Stap (N Stap) (the Staps) (the additional owners) were added to the original owners as those on behalf of whom the Commission sought damages and
June Maude Collings (J Collings), the mother of Collings, a director and the secretary of Collings Constructions, and Penny Kioussis (P Kioussis), a daughter of Kioussis, as well as being a director and an employee of Venture, were added as respondents (the added respondents). Two or more respondents in the Collings Construction interest or in the Venture interest are referred to in these reasons, respectively, as the Collings group and the Venture group.

The application was further amended on 2 September 1994 pursuant to leave granted by Wilcox J on 18 May 1994 by which the relief sought was expanded to include declaratory orders as to the unenforceability of certain agreements between the owners and Venture and related injunctive relief. On 30 October , pursuant to leave granted by me on that day, the Commission filed a "Third Further Amended Application" seeking revised injunctive relief against
Collings, Kioussis, J Collings and P Kioussis, and declaratory and related relief in relation to certain arbitration proceedings between Venture and some of the owners. The injunctive relief sought in the third further amended application has been further expanded during the course of submissions in the proceedings in the form of the document marked for identification 20.

The Federal Court proceedings were transferred to this Court (the proceedings) by order of Wilcox J of 16 September 1994, made pursuant to <case> of the
Jurisdiction of Courts Cross-Vesting Act 1987 (Cth) (the Cross-Vesting
Act).

B. Jurisdiction of the Court 
The rationale for transferring the Federal Court proceedings was to facilitate resolution of extensive technical factual issues by recourse to Pt 72 of the
Supreme Court Rules which would permit those issues to be the subject of a report of a technically qualified referee. The making of that order was opposed by the Venture group on the basis that the Federal Court had no jurisdiction to transfer the Federal Court proceedings. It was contended that the power conferred by <case> of the Cross-Vesting Act did not extend to a power to transfer proceedings instituted by the Commission, relying upon the express exclusion of such proceedings from the investing of jurisdiction upon a State Court under <case> of the Jurisdiction of Court (Miscellaneous
Amendments) Act 1987 (the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) amendment) and from the power conferred on the Federal Court to transfer proceedings to a
State court under <case>.

The Venture group did not appeal from the decision of Wilcox J so transferring the Federal Court proceedings. In these proceedings, a motion was brought by the Venture group seeking to relitigate that jurisdictional question, but, for reasons which presumably were seen as being in their interests, that motion was not pursued. However, the Venture group maintained their position that this Court was without jurisdiction.

Following the conclusion of the hearing before me the Venture group sought to regurgitate that question by means of an application to the Full Court of the
Federal Court for the issue of writs of prohibition and/or certiorari relating to the order made by Wilcox J on 16 September 1994. On 23 May 1996 the Full
Court refused that application (the Full Court decision).

By application dated 20 June 1996 the Venture Group applied to the High Court for special leave to appeal from the Full Court decision. On 30 September 1996 that leave was refused. While refusing the Venture group's application, the
Full Court decision made it clear that the Venture group was not precluded from pressing their challenge to the jurisdiction of the Court in these proceedings.

In refusing prohibition or certiorari the Full Court made the following observations: "Is there anything to prohibit? 
Prohibition will not issue if the order the subject of prohibition is exhausted in the sense that all possible operation of it is at an end: see R.
v. Hibble; Ex parte The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited <case>; [(1920) 28 CLR 456], 463 per Knox CJ and Gavan Duffy J. The test is not whether the Federal Court is functus officio or whether the order can no longer be enforced. In a case such as the present the test may be said to be whether the order made without jurisdiction "remains in force so as to impose liabilities upon an individual".
 (R. v. Hibble at 463 per Knox CJ and Gavan Duffy J).

The applicants contended that the order made by Wilcox J founded, and continued to found, the jurisdiction being exercised by the Supreme Court and that the operation of the order would not be exhausted until the Supreme Court ceased to exercise jurisdiction in reliance upon it.

This submission involves, in our view, a misconception of the effect of [s.5(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s5.html) of the CVA. We have explained earlier that [s.5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s5.html) did not operate to invest the Supreme Court with any jurisdiction; in the present case that was brought about by [s.4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s4.html) of the CVA. An order under [s.5(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s5.html) involved no more than the exercise of the power conferred on the Federal Court to order the transfer of the proceeding to the Supreme Court. Thereafter the proceeding was wholly within the Supreme Court, the jurisdiction of which did not depend upon the order that transferred it there.

In our view, the order for transfer of the proceeding was exhausted in the relevant sense upon the transfer being completed and thereafter, to adopt what was said by Knox CJ and Gavan Duffy J in R. v. Hibble at 463, the order no longer imposed any liabilities on any person. Nor could it do so in the future.

It may be that if, contrary to our view, jurisdiction was not conferred upon the Supreme Court by [s.4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s4.html) of the CVA the remedy, putting to one side the question whether as a matter of discretion any relief should be granted, would have been by way of application for an order against Hunter J under [s.33(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s33.html) of the [Judiciary Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/). [Section (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s33.html) provides that the High Court may make orders or direct the issue of writs requiring any court to abstain from the exercise of any federal jurisdiction it does not possess.

Should the Court grant prohibition? 
If, contrary to the conclusions we have reached, Wilcox J had no jurisdiction to make the order transferring the proceeding to the Supreme
Court, we would nevertheless refuse the application for a writ of prohibition on discretionary grounds. For the reasons that follow, we consider this to be one of those exceptional cases in which, even if an absence of jurisdiction is patent, prohibition should be refused..

We accept that the applicants have not waived their right to object to the absence of jurisdiction in the Supreme Court. To the contrary, they have pleaded and argued their objection to jurisdiction in the proceeding now awaiting judgment by Hunter J. The judgment will no doubt include reasons for his Honour's decision on the jurisdictional point. If, as Hunter J has already indicated he will, he rules against that objection, then his judgment may be the subject of an appeal to the Court of Appeal on all grounds including absence of jurisdiction.
 
In that regard it is difficult to envisage a clearer case of election - the election being to have the jurisdictional issue determined in and as part of the proceeding transferred to the Supreme Court of New South Wales.

The doctrine was described by Gaudron J in The Commonwealth v. Verwayen CLR 394 at 484-5; 95 ALR 321 at 385-6 as follows: "It is clear that a party to litigation will be held to a position previously taken (that position having been intentionally taken with knowledge) if, as a result of that earlier position, the relationship of the parties has changed.
The changed relationship, in the terms used in Phillips v. Martin and approved in Wilson v. McIntosh, constitutes an "equit[y] which [the other] has .... raised.

Given that the position deliberately adopted by one party has brought about a change in the relationship of the litigants, a doctrine which holds the parties to that relationship may be seen as resting either on general policy considerations or on principles analogous to those of estoppel. Such a doctrine, by ensuring fair dealing in the conduct of litigation and by promoting the finality of litigation, aids the efficient administration of justice." 
The conduct of the proceedings before the referee, in the Supreme Court and the time and great expense incurred in that regard demonstrate the extent to which the relationship between the parties has changed in the sense discussed by Gaudron J.

The statement by the applicants that their participation in the Supreme Court proceedings is under objection and without prejudice to their right to contend that the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction in the matter does not assist the applicants on the issue of election.

That is so for two reasons. First, we have accepted that no election has occurred in respect of the jurisdictional issue itself - the election relates to the manner, and proceedings, in which it is to be determined. Secondly, as was stated by Long Innes J in Haynes v. Hirst <case>; [(1927) 27 SR 480] at 489.
 "In plain language a man can only elect once, and when once he has elected he is bound by his election and cannot again avail himself of his former option, merely because he claimed in the first instance to exercise his election without prejudice. A man, having eaten his cake does not still have it, even though he professed to eat it without prejudice." 
Further, we are not satisfied that other and more appropriate avenues to challenge the exercise of jurisdiction in the Supreme Court were or are not open to the applicants.

It is far from clear that an appeal under s.13(a) of the CVA was not available. If the order of Wilcox J was made without power it is difficult to describe the order as made "under" the CVA. Although the policy of s.13(a) is to prevent appeals from discretionary orders made within power we do not see that policy as mandating a prohibition of appeals from orders made without power. Such a prohibition would not be consistent with the cross-vesting scheme which is designed to ensure transfers only in appropriate cases. Such cases must, by definition, be restricted to cases where there is power to transfer.

In any event there still remains a right to appeal any adverse decision of
Hunter J on jurisdiction. As we have pointed out the issue of jurisdiction arises under s. 4(1) and not s.5(4) of the CVA. That is, and remains, a matter for adjudication by the Supreme Court at first instance and on appeal, if there is an appeal." (My emphasis) 
On the application of the Venture group these proceedings were relisted on 29
November 1996 to present further submissions on this jurisdiction question.
The further submissions consisted of a copy of the submissions presented on behalf of Venture to the Full Court on the application for prohibition. In these reasons I have addressed the submissions previously made to me during the course of these proceedings.

In my opinion, the Venture group's challenge to the transfer of the Federal
Court proceedings, on the construction put forward of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) amendment, is not soundly based. The general scheme of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) amendment is to confer an exclusive jurisdiction in respect of matters under the Act upon the Federal Court, save for the investiture of State courts with Federal jurisdiction concerning civil proceedings under Pt V of the Act, except in relation to civil proceedings instituted by the Minister or the Commission.
The Court so invested with jurisdiction includes a State court of inferior jurisdiction (s 86).

S 86A of the Act provides for the power of the Federal Court to transfer such civil proceedings to a State court provided that the latter has the power to grant the remedies sought. So, under these provisions, there was no conferring of jurisdiction upon State courts in respect of civil proceedings under Pt V instituted by the Minister or by the Commission and there was no power to transfer proceedings so instituted to a State court. The [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) amendment was assented to on 26 May 1987 and its proclaimed date of commencement was 1
September 1987.

The Federal Court proceedings, however, have been transferred to this Court pursuant to <case> of the Cross-Vesting Act. That legislation was assented to also on 26 May 1987 and its date of commencement was proclaimed to be 1
July 1988. The Cross-Vesting Act was concerned with the jurisdiction of superior courts. Importantly, in relation to the decision of Wilcox J in transferring the Federal Court proceedings, <case> of the Cross-Vesting Act invested the Supreme Court of the State with jurisdiction where the Federal
Court had jurisdiction in a civil matter and where "the Supreme Court ....
would not, apart from this section, have jurisdiction with respect to that matter". In my opinion, the meaning of that section is quite plain and jurisdiction in respect of the matter excluded from the investing of jurisdiction in [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s86.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) amendment was, by <case> of the Cross-Vesting Act, invested in the Supreme Court.

Under <case> of the Cross-Vesting Act power is conferred upon the Federal
Court to transfer, in "the interests of justice", a civil proceeding pending in the Federal Court to a State Supreme Court where "it is more appropriate that the relevant proceeding be determined by that Supreme Court".

There is nothing in the terminology of ss 4 or 5, in my opinion, which would call for a reading down of those provisions to accommodate the construction contended for by the Venture group. The conferring of jurisdiction and the power to transfer relevant proceedings is, for present purposes, unqualified.
By contrast, <case> of the Cross-Vesting Act specifically excludes from the operation of <case> matters that, while their subject matter has no bearing on this question, strongly infer that the qualification suggested by the respondents was deliberately omitted from matters expressly excluded under s (4).

In relation to civil proceedings arising under Pt V of the Act special provision is made by <case> of the Cross-Vesting Act for the transfer of proceedings to a State court of inferior jurisdiction. It is of some interest,
I think, that in creating that power, there was excluded from it the power to transfer proceedings of "a special Federal matter" within the meaning of the cross-vesting legislation.

In my opinion, given the unqualified investing of jurisdiction and the power of transferring to the Supreme Court matters in respect of which it so possesses jurisdiction, I can see no basis for a construction of the Cross-
Vesting Act which would have the effect of excluding from its operation civil proceedings in respect of which the Supreme Court would otherwise have jurisdiction. I think there are several reasons for that construction of the
Cross-Vesting Act:
S 86 is concerned with the conferring of jurisdiction on State courts, including courts of limited jurisdiction, and is confined to proceedings under
Pt V of the Act.
By contrast, the Cross-Vesting Act invests Supreme Courts with a much wider jurisdiction than that the subject of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s86.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) amendment and, in investing Supreme Courts with such a jurisdiction, makes no attempt to exclude from its ambit civil proceedings instituted by the Commission in respect of matters arising under [Pt
V](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p5) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/).
Indeed, where provision is made in <case> of the Cross-Vesting Act for the exclusion of certain matters from the jurisdiction invested in the Supreme
Courts by that section, the exclusion is limited to matters under the
Conciliation and Arbitration Act and ss 45D and 45E of the Act. One would have thought that, if there was any intention to limit the jurisdiction in the manner suggested by the Venture group, or to limit the power of the Court to transfer matters in respect of which jurisdiction was so invested, there would be express provision in the Cross-Vesting Act. The fact that there are specific limitations in the Cross-Vesting Act with no reference to the suggested limitations proffered by the respondents leads me to the conclusion that no such qualification is to be found nor inferred in the Cross-Vesting
Act: indeed the contrary is to be inferred.

Further, when one looks at <case> of the Cross-Vesting Act, which deals specifically with the transfer to a court of inferior jurisdiction of a matter arising under Pt V of the Act, the section is surrounded by exclusions. Given the limited conferring of jurisdiction in the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) amendment in relation to inferior courts, it is clear that the qualification that the
Venture group seek to impose upon [ss ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s4.html) and [5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s5.html) of the cross-vesting legislation finds expression only in <case> of the Cross-Vesting
Act and is limited to courts of inferior jurisdiction.

I do not understand the Venture group's challenge to the jurisdiction of this
Court to hear these proceedings to extend to a submission that, accepting the existence of jurisdiction in the Federal Court to transfer the proceedings to this Court, there was no basis upon which the discretion could have been exercised in favour of making that order. In any event, if such a challenge was raised by the respondents, it should be held that they were bound by the decision of Wilcox J from which no appeal was made.

I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Wilcox J in transferring the Federal Court proceedings to this Court and, in substance, I agree with those reasons, subject to what I have expressed earlier in these reasons and save only for his Honour's statement that by virtue of the provision of s (2) of the Act the Commission had been precluded from instituting the
Federal Court proceedings in this Court. While that may be so prior to the enactment of the Cross Vesting Act, I would have thought that <case>(c) had the effect of investing this Court with jurisdiction to entertain an application by the Commission in respect of a matter arising under Pt V of the
Act. However, that is a matter that only went to the question of costs and has no bearing, in my opinion, upon the correctness of the decision of Wilcox J in transferring the Federal Court proceedings to this Court.

Further, it seems to me that the reasoning which I have expressed in these reasons for judgment accords with the analysis of the cross-vesting legislation by the full Court of the Federal Court in NEC Information Systems
Australia Pty Ltd versus Lockhart & Ors (Unreported, 12 June 1992) and, more significantly, in the Federal Court decision.

C. [Judiciary Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth) [s
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s78b.html) 
The Commission raised the question whether the case of the Venture group, in particular that contained in pars 4.2.1, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.4 and 5.5 of their defence, involved "a matter arising under the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) or involving its interpretation" within the meaning of [s
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s78b.html) of the [Judiciary Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth).

The first set of allegations, namely, pars 4.2.1, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5, raise a defence that the Commission "does not have standing in law" to pursue recovery from the respondents, on behalf of the owners, of the damages claimed in these proceedings, in so far as that would involve recovery of an amount paid to the owners by the Building Services Corporation (the Corporation) under the
Building Services Corporation Insurance Scheme (the Corporation insurance scheme) created under the Building Services Corporation Act, 1989 (BSC
Act). In this the Venture group rely upon the provisions of <case> of the BSC
Act in so far as it provides as follows: "98. (1) Any amount paid by the Corporation under BSC Insurance may be recovered by the Corporation in a court of competent jurisdiction as a debt from the person by whom the residential building work concerned was done or contracted to be done." 
The submissions on behalf of the Venture group put the case based on <case> in the following way: "7.2.1 The purpose and effect of sec. 98(1) as read with 98(2) is to vest any claims in respect of monies paid by the BSC under its insurance scheme to any of the building owners in the BSC.

Such claims therefore Inhere in the BSC as at the point of time when payment is made.

In case the meaning of sec. 98(1) is in any doubt, the submission above is confirmed by the provisions of sec. 98(2) which provides that the Corporation is subrogated to the rights of any contractor against the suppliers or the manufacturers of the material or the designers of the defective design.
 .2.2 Alternatively, and in any event, they vest when the BSC makes an election to recover monies paid pursuant to its insurance scheme by instituting action against the builder.
 .3 The TPC, acts in a "representative capacity", and its rights to represent the building owners and claim damages on their behalf cannot be greater than the rights of the building owners. The building owners do not have the right to claim any amounts paid by the BSC to them pursuant to its insurance scheme, and consequently, the Plaintiff has no standing to claim such amounts from the defendants in this action." 
The contention in par 7.2.2 is based upon evidence that the Corporation instituted an action against Venture under <case>. In these proceedings, there is no dispute that the Corporation has made certain payments to some of the owners. For the purposes of this question I have assumed that the payments are payments falling within the ambit of that section. In my view, the making of that assumption does not constitute these proceedings by the Commission for damages pursuant to <case>(1A) of the Act an action to recover from Venture any amount paid by the Corporation to any of the owners. That right of action by the Corporation remains unaffected by the damages suit of the Commission in these proceedings. No question of impeded performance of the Commission's statutory function arises and there is no call for a <case> notice in respect of the question raised in par 4 of the Venture defence.

The second question relates to the operation of the [Commercial Arbitration
Act 1984](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/) [s (a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/caa1984219/s4.html) which defines a party to an arbitration agreement within the meaning of that
Act as including "any person claiming through or under a party to the
Arbitration Agreement". There are current disputes between certain of the owners and Venture which have been referred to arbitration under an
Arbitration Agreement within the meaning of that Act. Par 5.5 of the defence is in the following terms: "5.5 In the premises, the Third Defendant prays for an order that all disputes which fall within the arbitration clauses be referred to arbitration pursuant to such arbitration clauses and that claims arising from such disputes in these proceedings be stayed pending a determination thereof by arbitration." 
Again, in my opinion, there is no semblance of a constitutional question arising in these proceedings. S 87(1A) and <case>(1B) of the Act set out the basis upon which the Commission's claim for damages on behalf of the owners is founded. In my opinion an action by the Commission under those sections "on behalf of" any of the owners who may be parties to any such arbitration is in no sense a remedy or right having the effect of making the Commission a "person claiming through or under a party to the Arbitration Agreement". The characterisation of these proceedings as an action on their behalf does not mean, in my opinion, that it is an action brought by the Commission which has acquired some title from an owner as a party to an arbitration agreement.

The phrase `through or under a party' was considered by the High Court in
Tanning Research Laboratories Inc versus O'Brien <case>; [(1989-1990) 169 CLR 332] at where that phrase was used in <case> of the Arbitration (Foreign Award
Agreements) Act 1974 (Cth).
 
The following passage appears in the joint judgment of Brennan J, as his
Honour then was, and Dawson J at 342: "In the first place, as sub-s. (2) speaks of both parties to an arbitration agreement, a person who claims through or under a party may be either a person seeking to enforce or a person seeking to resist the enforcement of an alleged contractual right. The subject of the claim may be either a cause of action or a ground of defence. Next, the prepositions "through" and "under" convey the notion of a derivative cause of action or ground of defence that is to say, a cause of action or ground of defence derived from the party. In other words, an essential element of the cause of action or defence must be or must have been vested in or exercisable (sic)by the party before the person claiming through or under the party can rely on the cause of action or ground of defence." 
It is clear that these proceedings are not proceedings in which the Commission is "seeking to enforce or ... seeking to resist the enforcement of an alleged contractual right", nor are these proceedings "derivative" in the sense used in the quoted passage. These proceedings are derivative only in the sense that they are proceedings for damages in respect of proscribed conduct affecting the owners who will be the recipient of any damages awarded against the respondents.

Moreover, the respondents have not pursued this claim for a stay, have fully participated in these proceedings and, in their final submissions, far from pursuing this defence, have recorded unqualified undertakings to the Court to bring existing arbitration proceedings with the owners to an end. In my opinion, there are no circumstances giving rise to a duty of the Court not to proceed with these proceedings until notification of this question has been given to the Attorney-General under [s
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s78b.html) of the [Judiciary
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/).

D. Amendment of the Defences 
There are a number of related questions involving amendments and application for leave to amend pleadings. In order to put those questions into context it is useful to have a brief chronology of the history of amendments to date in these proceedings.

The course of amendments to the application is traced earlier in these reasons. In the case of the defences, the Venture group, in their original defence, segregated the "construction issues" from the remainder of their defences which were filed on 18 November [1994. Par 1.2] of that defence purported to put matters in issue in the following form: "1.2 The allegations made by the Plaintiff against the First, Second and/or
Fifth Defendants will not be traversed "sereatim".

The formal allegations, including the names of the parties and their addresses will be deemed to be admitted.

All other allegations inconsistent with "Venture's" Points of Defence below will be deemed to be denied and the Plaintiff is put to the proof thereof.

In respect of all other allegations, the Plaintiff is put to the proof thereof." 
In so far as the proceedings involve a recovery of damages from the Venture group, the defence alleged that the claims were "premature" (par 6.3). This allegation relied upon pars 6.1 and 6.2 of the defence which were in the following terms: "6.1 Pursuant to clause 13 of each of the said "Building Contracts", a complete regime was agreed upon between the Third Defendant and the "Building
Owners" for claims for defective workmanship or improper materials.
 .2 "Venture" alleges that the "Building Owners" do not have any such claims for damages unless they have acted within the terms of the said clause and given the seven (7) days notice referred to therein." 
Par 10 put in issue compliance by the Commission with the provisions of s (1B) of the Act in so far as it required the written consents of the owners to the bringing of claims on their behalf under that section. The defence relating to "construction issues" ceased to have any major influence in the proceedings with the adoption of the report of 9 August 1995 (the report) by
Mr G Lumsdaine (the referee) as varied in accordance with my reasons for judgment of 28 September 1995 (the varied report) under Pt 72 of the Supreme
Court Rules. Further, substantial concessions, which were made by the respondents in relation to those issues, removed contention from the allegations against Venture of defective construction of the subject residential buildings for the owners.

The Venture group's "first amended" defence, in substance, repeated its original defence: the principal additional material being reliance upon proscribed conduct on the part of the owners within the meaning of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s42.html) of the [Fair Trading Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/) .
This matter was not pursued. The amendments included one which denied any allegation not specifically traversed (par 36).

A "second amended" defence was filed on 10 October 1995. It contained admissions by the Venture group as to the allegations of conduct (par 1.3.2) and raised an issue of release from liability arising out of an alleged release by the Corbetts of an alleged third party tortfeasor, namely, the
Council of the Shire of Wollondilly (Wollondilly Council), in consideration for an alleged payment by Wollondilly Council to the Corbetts in relation to the defective construction of the Corbetts' residence by Venture.

Pars 37 set up pleas in bar to damages claimed other than on a tortious basis and to claims said to be too remote or otherwise unrecoverable, such as damages for "vexation, distress ... and exemplary damages". It alleged that the Court had no jurisdiction to make orders in relation to the arbitration proceedings current between the owners and Venture. No objection was taken to this amendment by the Commission.

A document entitled "third amended" defence was proffered by the Venture group. In that proposed defence, for the first time, the Venture group foreshadowed reliance upon the limitation provisions of [s (1CA).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s87.html)
It was contended that this proposed defence arose out of the circumstances of my declaratory ruling of 23 October 1995 (the consent ruling). It will be necessary to refer to that ruling in more detail. That proposed amendment was filed in Court on 24 October 1995 (T490). The Commission objected to the raising of the limitations issue (T491). The further consideration of the proposed amendment was deferred in circumstances which are described in the transcript (T492 - 493).

The Venture Group did not pursue the "third amended" defence. On 16 November the Venture group presented a "fourth amended" defence and sought leave so to amend. The leave to amend was opposed by the Commission and, having regard to the stage at which the proceedings had reached, a ruling on whether the Venture group should have leave was deferred until the conclusion of the hearing. In substance, the fourth amended defence took up the defences set out in the proposed third amended defence and expanded the defences relating to the BSC payments to the owners and the foreshadowed limitations defence as set out in the following paragraphs: "38.4 Alternatively "Venture" pleads that all payments made by the Corbetts as particularised, having taken place more than three years prior to 17 December are statuted (sic) barred.
 .1 Should this Honourable Court hold that there was complicity between
First, Second and Fifth Defendants on the one hand, and Third and Fourth
Defendants on the other, with the result that the conduct of the First, Second and/or Fifth Defendants constitutes conduct of the Third and Fourth
Defendants, "Venture" alleges that all of the claims made by the Plaintiff in its representative capacity are statute barred, alternatively, that the claims made by the Plaintiff on behalf of Ferris, Smith, Corbett and Stap are statute barred.

Alternatively claims for refund of all monies paid by the Building Owners to either "Collings" and/or "Venture" prior to 16 September 1991, or in the cases of Corbett, Grimston and Stap prior to 17 December 1991 are statute barred.
 .2 In amplification of the allegation in paragraph 39.1 above, "Venture" alleges: under [sec.
(1CA)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s87.html), an application under [sec.
(1A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s87.html) has to be commenced within two years after the date on which the cause of action accrued.

Plaintiffs application on behalf of the Tanti, Ferris, Quaglia and Smith, commenced on the 16 September 1993.

Plaintiffs application on behalf of the Corbett, Grimston and Stap commenced on the 17 December 1993, by virtue of this Courts declaration to that effect.
 the causes of action of the Tanti, Ferris, Quaglis (sic), and Smith accrued more than two years prior to 16 September 1993.
 the causes of action in regard to Corbett, Grimston and Stap accrued more than two years prior to 17 December 1993." 
In the case of the Collings group, the original defence did not plead to par 8 of the amended statement of claim, which averred the provision of consent by the owners in conformity with [s (1B).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s87.html)
That defence was filed on 15 November 1994. However, on 2 November 1995, the
Collings group sought to file an amended defence to the third further amended statement of claim. In that amended defence the Collings group pleaded that the allegations contained in par 8 of the statement of claim were not admitted. By that proposed amended defence the Collings group also sought to rely upon the limitations provisions of [s (1CA)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/s87.html) and further sought credit in respect of any damages found against the Collings group of any payments received by the owners, including payments under <case> of the BSC Act. The original defences of the Collings group did not raise in a permissible form any defence based upon a limitations point.

In the case of the original defence of the Venture group, I think par 1.2 failed to comply with O 11 r 13 and failed to raise any limitation question in the manner required by O 11 r 10 of the Federal Court Rules.

Submissions at the conclusion of the hearing were presented on the premise that the respondents had leave to amend to rely upon all issues sought to be raised by them so as to enable all issues to be determined should leave so to amend be granted.

I propose to leave the limitations question until I have ascertained the precise nature of the damages said to have been sustained by the owners. I think this approach finds support in the way in which Gaudron J considered the limitations question in Hawkins versus Clayton (1988) 164 CLR 539 at 601 - 602.
It was also the approach adopted by the Full Court of the Federal Court in
Magman International versus Westpac <case>; [(1991) 32 FCR 1] at 12 where Beaumont J with whose reasons Black CJ, Gummow, von Dousa, and Hill JJ agreed, had this to say: " A. Were the claims under the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) barred by [s82(2)?](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s82.html) 
In Hawkins versus Clayton (1988) 164 CLR 539, Gaudron J, in the context of a claim in negligence for economic loss, pointed out that, in determining when such a cause of action accrues, it may be relevant to consider "the precise interest infringed" by the negligent act or omission. She said, by way of one of several examples (at 601): "... if the interest infringed is an interest in recouping moneys advanced it may be appropriate to fix the time of accrual of the cause of action when recoupment becomes impossible rather than at the time when the antecedent right to recoup should have come into existence, for the actual loss is sustained only when recoupment becomes impossible." 
She went on to say (at 601-602): "Economic loss ... imports loss sustained by a juristic entity in relation to the assets or liabilities of that entity. The various and complex economic relationships which are a feature of present-day economic organisation suggest that loss may manifest itself in various forms, and it is for this reason that there may be occasions when it is necessary to identify precisely the interest which has been infringed.

It would be too simplistic to restrict analysis of economic loss merely to a consideration of reduced value or increased liability." 
Although these observations were directed to the position at common law, the underlying reasoning is capable of a general application, including the present statutory context where reference is made "to loss or damage" in terms sufficiently general enough to extend to any injury of an economic kind. In order to identify precisely the economic interests involved in the present case it is necessary now to refer to the facts in more detail." 
E. Validity of Consents under [s (1B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s87.html) 
I think it is desirable to address the defence based upon <case> (1B) of the Act before examining the nature and existence of the causes of action relied upon by the Commission on behalf of the owners: that is the question of the
Commission's compliance with <case>(1B) of the Act which requires it to obtain the consent of each of the owners prior to the making of an application under s 87(1A) for damages on their behalf.

Exhibit BR is a bundle of consents of the owners to the making of an application on their behalf by the Commission under <case>(1A) of the Act. The consents are in common form and, as an example, that of J Quaglia is in the following form: " CONSENT 
I JOSEPHINE QUAGLIA of 74 PITTWATER RD. GLADESVILLE 2111 consent to the Trade Practices Commission ("the Commission") making an application on my behalf to the Federal Court of Australia ("the Court") for such orders as the Commission considers appropriate to compensate me for the loss or damage suffered by me as a result of the conduct of all or any of
Collings Construction Co Pty Ltd, Wayne Collings, Harry Kioussis and Venture
Industries Pty Ltd (`the respondents").

In consideration of the Commission taking all reasonable steps to make an application pursuant to section 87(1B) ("the application") of the [Trade
Practices Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) ("the Act") on my behalf in the Federal Court of Australia for such order or orders available under section 87(1A) of the Act as the Commission considers necessary and appropriate, I hereby:
Agree to do all things reasonably necessary to assist the Commission in connection with the said application.
Authorise the Commission to do all things necessary on my behalf in connection with the said application.
Agree to make full and complete disclosure of all information and all documents in my possession, custody or control in connection with the said application.
Acknowledge that in consenting to the application I give up the right to bring my own proceedings under <case> of the Act.
Acknowledge that the Commission will be solely responsible for the conduct and carriage of the application and that it may, in its discretion, compromise, discontinue or consent to any orders it thinks necessary and appropriate in connection with the application.
Acknowledge that the Commission is bringing proceedings not only on my behalf but on behalf of other persons who have claimed to have suffered loss or damage by the conduct of the respondents and will act in the proper discharge of its statutory function in the interest of all such persons rather than in the interests of any particular person in that group.
Agree not to make any claim in respect of the application against the
Commission or anyone acting on its behalf and I shall hold it and them or any of them indemnified against any such claim made on my behalf." 
Such consents were given by the owners as follows: by the Ferrises, the
Smiths, the Tantis on 20 August 1993; the Quaglias on 21 August 1993, the
Grimstons on 15 November 1993, the Corbetts on 17 November 1993 and the Staps on 19 November 1993.

None of the consents, in terms, referred to applications in respect of loss or damage suffered by any of them as a result of the alleged conduct of J
Collings and P Kioussis. Those parties were joined in the amended application, filed 17 December 1993, pursuant to the consent order of Wilcox J of 15
December 1993. This amendment has given rise to two challenges by the respondents, namely, (1) that none of the consents, in terms, consents to the making of an application on the signatories behalf for damages against J
Collings or P Kioussis, (2) that in the case of the additional owners, those consents were ineffective as not being given before the making of the application by the Commission. It was submitted on behalf of the respondents that, while the additional owners provided their written consents prior to the filing of the amended application on 17 December 1993, those consents were ineffectual as, in the respondents' submission, the amendment is deemed to take effect from the commencement of the Federal Court proceedings, namely, with the filing of the application on 3 September 1993. The matter was brought to a head by the motion of the Collings group of 18 October 1995, returnable instanter, seeking an order pursuant to Pt 31 r 2 of the Supreme Court Rules for the separate determination of the question whether the Commission was entitled to make the application on behalf of the additional owners. I delivered an ex tempore judgment in the following terms: "HIS HONOUR: In these proceedings the 1st, 2nd and 5th defendants move by notice of motion dated 18 October 1995, returnable instanter, for an order that pursuant to part 31 rule 2(a) of the Supreme Court Rules that the question whether the plaintiff is entitled to bring these proceedings pursuant to [section (1B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s87.html) of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) on behalf of: 
Peter John Corbett and Alison Marie Corbett; 
Allan Grimston and Sharon Grimston; 
Jacobus Petrus Gerardus Stap and Nicole Louise Stap, be tried separately from and prior to any question in these proceedings.

The application is sought to be founded upon the construction of [section (1B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s87.html) of the [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/), which requires the Commission in bringing proceedings on behalf of persons who may have suffered damage as a result of proscribed conduct under the Act to obtain the written consent of those persons prior to the making of such an application.

The consents of the named persons in the notice of motion are dated variously , 17 and 19 November 1993; query whether the consent of Mr Stap is 9
November 1993. Each of those dates post-date the date of the original application filed in the Federal Court in proceedings number G687 of 1993, which was filed on 3 September 1993.

However, it is noted that that application does not purport to be one on behalf of any of the persons named in the defendants' notice of motion. It appears that the application by the Commission, which included a claim for damages on behalf of the persons named in the notice of motion, was made by way of amendment filed in the Federal Court on 17 December 1993.

The defendants seek to argue that as amendments in the ordinary course operate not from the date of the amendment, but from the initiation of the subject proceedings, it follows that the giving of consents by the named persons in the notice of motion after the filing of the original application, though before the amended application - filed 17 December 1993, made pursuant to leave granted by Wilcox J on 15 December 1993 - made on their behalf results in the prohibition in section 87(1B), which would preclude the Commission from making this application on behalf of the named persons.

I have not been referred to any particular authority. However, it is my recollection that there is a significant qualification on the general rule as to the date of operation of amendments which lies in the principle where parties are joined by way of amendment to proceedings that amendment operates from its date and not from the date of the initiation of the subject proceedings.

To illustrate the point, the joinder of parties by way of amendment could not operate to expose a joined party to a cause of action which at the time of amendment would be statute barred.

Without deciding the point, I will content myself with observing that the amended application in these proceedings, which joined the named persons as the persons on behalf of whom damages are sought in these proceedings by the plaintiff, is in the nature of an amendment joining parties to existing proceedings. However, I think there is another consideration which bears upon this question, again, which I find unnecessary to decide, for reasons which I will come to, that is, that under section 87(1B) it seems to me that the application that may be made by the Commission under section 87(1B) on behalf of persons who may have suffered damage as a result of proscribed conduct, is an application that may be made during the course of proceedings under section , these being such proceedings by the Commission.

I say that because section 87(1B) provides that: "Where, in a proceeding instituted ... under section 80, a person is found to have engaged ... in conduct in contravention of a provision of Part IVA or V, the Commission may make an application under sub-section (1A) on behalf of one or more persons identified in the application who have suffered, or are likely to suffer, loss or damage by the conduct ..." 
The section then goes on to deal with the prohibition against the making of an application without the written consent of the persons who have so suffered that damage.

On the face of it, proceedings may be instituted under section 80, and in those proceedings it may be found that the persons against whom they have been brought are guilty of proscribed conduct, which would permit, at that stage in the proceedings, the making of an application on behalf of persons who have suffered damage as a result of that proscribed conduct.

If that be so, then it seems to me that the amended application to which I have referred, and which is made so as to include an application on behalf of the persons named in the defendant's notice of motion, is both an admissible course and one which satisfies the provision of section 87(1B), and in particular the requirement that before making such an application the written consent of the named persons be obtained for the making of that application.

As I have said, I do not find it necessary to determine any of these questions. At worst, they are attractive arguments, in my opinion, as to the operation of section 87(1B), and as to the effect of the obtaining of the consents of the named persons prior to the 1993 amendment of the plaintiff's application.

Even if I were of the contrary opinion, I would not be disposed to accede to this motion for the reason that the issues that are raised by the Commission under section 80 and relate, as the application does, to the proscribed conduct of the defendants, in turn relating to that conduct as affecting each of the persons named in the amended application, and on whose behalf the
Commission brings proceedings for damages. It would be, I think, a comparatively futile exercise to embark upon the determination of a separate question on the matters that are now sought to be raised on behalf of the 1st, nd and 5th defendants.

No doubt these are matters that will be ventilated in the course of submissions. In my opinion, that is the appropriate time for the final determination of those questions.

These proceedings are proceedings where one would have to be highly optimistic to believe that there would be little likelihood of any decision of mine remaining unchallenged by way of appeal. I think, in those circumstances, it is highly desirable that I endeavour to resolve the issues that have been raised in these proceedings and, right or wrong, expose those decisions for review by way of appeal so as to permit the final resolution of the matter on such an appeal without the necessity of referring the matter back to the Court of first instance.

The application for an order pursuant to Pt 31 is refused with costs.

The defendants also seek leave to amend their defence to put in issue, in effect, the failure of the plaintiff to comply with section 87(1B).

I had proposed to defer consideration of that application at the request of the plaintiff, to permit it to put on such evidence as it sees fit, or to present such submissions as it deems appropriate in opposition to that aspect of the application. Accordingly, I will defer the hearing of that application until 10 am, Monday, 23 October 1995.

The 3rd, 4th and 6th defendants have also intimated they desire to raise similar and related defences by way of amendment. In the interest of order, I direct that any application for leave to amend be made by 5 pm Friday, 20
October, together with any affidavit or documentary evidence in support of that. That application will be returnable for Monday, 23 October 1995, and to be heard with the remaining application of the 1st, 2nd and 5th defendants.

Although it appears from that judgment that the respondents considered that the current state of the pleadings did not encompass a defence based upon the alleged failure of the Commission to comply with the provisions of <case>(1B) of the Act, I doubt whether that view was justified. Par 8 of the Commission's application alleged that it brought the proceedings pursuant to <case>(1B) of the Act on behalf of the named owners "each of whom has given consent in writing as required by <case>(1B)". Par 10 of the original defence of the
Venture group was in the following terms: " "Venture" has no knowledge of the written consents referred to in this paragraph, does not admit them and puts (the Commission) to the proof thereof" 
On 19 October 1995 the Commission moved by Notice of Motion dated that day returnable on 23 October 1995 for the following orders: "1. That pursuant to Part 20 Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules, as to the
Amended Application and Amended Statement of Claim filed on 17 December 1993 pursuant to leave granted by Wilcox J on 15 December 1993, to the extent that such amendments added claims pursuant to section 87(1A/1B) [Trade Practices
Act 1974](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) on behalf of: 
Peter John Corbett and Alison Marie Corbett; 
Alan Grimston and Sharon Grimston; 
Jacobus Petrus Gerardus Stap and Nicole Louise Stap; such amendments are to take effect from 17 December 1993.
That the Plaintiff have leave to file a Third Further Amended Application and Third Further Amended Statement of Claim." 
On the return of that Motion it was dealt with by me in the following way: "The plaintiff moves for leave to amend the application and statement of claim in terms of the third further amended application and third further amended statement of claim. In relation to the plaintiff's motion returnable today no objection is taken by the second and fifth defendants to the order sought in paragraph 2. Mr Jacobs, on behalf of the Venture defendants, formally opposes the amendment but does not support that opposition by any submissions other than to say that he seeks to protect the interests of the Venture defendants by taking a formal objection and illustrating the position by alluding to the fact that it is the contention of the Venture defendants that certain of the proposed amendments do not disclose a cause of action or entitlement to relief in the form in which it is pleaded.

I note that the application is accompanied by a document entitled "Third
Further Amended Application" in which it seeks to rely upon "the grounds appearing in the Third Further Amended Statement of Claim". However, there is no such amended statement of claim presented, and counsel for the plaintiff seeks some relief from filing such a statement of claim if granted leave to amend notwithstanding the terms of paragraph 2 of the subject notice of motion. Although the reason for this being the voluminous nature of the statement of claim and of the expense and waste of its preparation to accommodate the proposed amendments, in the circumstances I will not deal with the application now but invite the plaintiff to give some further consideration to this practical difficulty. In the meantime I indicate that I propose to grant leave to file the third further amended application when this practical aspect is resolved.

As to the relief sought in paragraph 1, the purpose of the amendment as I understand it, is to put beyond argument the fact that the joinder by order of
Wilcox J on 15 December 1993 of the persons names in paragraph 1 of the subject notice was effective not from the date of the initiation of the proceedings but from the date of the amendment which was filed on 17 December
It is said that power to make such an order is to be found in [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/index.html#p40) rule 9(4) of the Supreme Court Rules on the basis that it involves a variation of the order of Wilcox J to which I have just referred. I am not so sure that the proposed order does involve such a variation.

It can be noted that no objection is taken to the making of such an order by the second or fifth defendants and that Mr Jacobs, on behalf of the Venture defendants, formally opposes the making of the order but does not support the submission in any other way. I propose to make the order not as a variation of the order of Wilcox J but as one declaratory of the effect that the subject amendment is to have in these proceedings. I make that order to make clear what I consider to be the unstated operation of that amendment, namely, that the joinder of the persons on behalf of whom damages are sought in these proceedings by the plaintiff as named in the subject order of Wilcox J took effect as at the date of the joinder and not at the date of the commencement of the proceedings.

I adjourn the motion to Thursday 26 October at 10 am for its final determination. I reserve the question of costs to that time." (T 457.46 - T458.50) 
That ruling has been taken up by the Venture group as a basis for seeking to raise a defence by way of limitations in the manner quoted earlier in these reasons. Prior to the hearing of submissions, I had occasion to reconsider the wisdom of the ruling given in relation to the deemed date of commencement of the application on behalf of the additional owners and the parties were informed that they should consider that ruling to be subject to reconsideration and to present in the course of submissions in these proceedings any further submissions they wished to make in respect of that matter. My present view of the effect of the 15 December 1993 order of Wilcox
J is as follows: 
In so far as there is any necessity to amend the defences of the various respondents to raise the issue whether the Commission has complied with s (1B) in obtaining the consents of the owners and, if so, to what extent, I think the defendants should have that leave. In my view the Venture group had effectively raised this issue in its original defence and I regard the issue as a live one from that point. No sensible purpose is served by distinguishing between the Venture group and the Collings group in this respect.

I think the correct approach to an understanding of the effectiveness of the various consents of the owners is to examine the nature of the relief sought in these proceedings, distinguishing between the relief sought against the corporate respondents and that sought against the personal respondents and, then, to examine the provisions of <case> in order to understand its operation in that context.

The relief sought against the corporate respondents is as against parties "engaged" in contravening conduct, whereas the relief sought against the personal respondents is as against persons "involved in the contravention", as that term is defined in <case> of the Act.

For present purposes <case> may be viewed as a section contemplating relief by way of compensation for loss or by way of an order preventing or reducing loss occasioned by proscribed conduct in three sets of circumstances, namely:
Where a party to proceedings under Pt VI has "suffered or is likely to suffer loss or damage" by proscribed conduct, in which case the Court may grant relief against the person engaged in the proscribed conduct in addition to the person who was involved in the contravention (s 87(1)).
Without the necessity for the institution of any proceedings under any other provision of Pt VI, the Court may grant relief on the application of a person who has suffered or is likely to suffer damage by proscribed conduct against the person who was engaged in that conduct and those involved in the contravention (s 87(1A)).
Where proceedings have been instituted under <case> by the Commission and a person is found to have engaged in proscribed conduct, the Commission may make application under <case>(1A) on behalf of persons who have suffered or are likely to suffer damage by reason of that conduct, provided that the
Commission has the consent in writing of such persons given before the application is made on their behalf (s 87(1B)). It is pursuant to <case>(1B) that the Commission has purported to bring this application on behalf of the respective owners.

I think the first question to be considered is whether the Commission is entitled to bring any application on behalf of the owners pursuant to <case>(1B) against the personal respondents: that is, whether <case>(1B) permits such an application in respect of persons who were involved in the contravention other than those who were engaged in the proscribed conduct. This question arises as a result of some difference in terminology adopted in the three sets of circumstances identified above in relation to the operation of <case>. As stated, <case> and <case>(1A) envisages an application "against the person who engaged in the conduct or a person who was involved in the contravention".
However, <case>(1B) only operates where, inter alia, a person is found to have engaged" in proscribed conduct, in which event the Commission "may make an application under sub-section (1A), on behalf of one or more persons, identified in the application to have suffered, or are likely to suffer loss or damage by the conduct ...". It has been submitted by the learned author of
Miller's [Trade Practices
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) 17th edition, at par 1415.16, that actions by the Commission pursuant to [s (1B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s87.html), in bringing an application under [s (1A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s87.html), may only be taken against persons engaged in proscribed conduct and that such an application cannot be brought against persons involved in the contravention "because the Commission's right under [s (1A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s87.html) to take action on behalf of such persons is limited to instances covered by [s (1B)".](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s87.html)
The authority given for this proposition is Trade Practices Commission -v-
Manfal Pty Ltd (In Liq) & Ors <case>; [(1991) 33 FCR 382.] That was a case in which Lee J declined to grant leave to the
Commission to discontinue the proceedings against the corporate respondent in proceedings brought by the Commission pursuant to [s (1B)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s87.html), in the course of which his Honour considered the effect of granting such leave on the entitlement of the Commission to maintain the application against the personal respondents.

Lee J described the nature of the proceedings before him in the following way: "The Commission commenced its action under s. 80 of the Act seeking an injunction to restrain Manfal and the individual respondents from acts which would involve Manfal being engaged in conduct contravening the provisions of s. 52A of the Act. Manfal ceased to trade some time ago and since then the live issue in the litigation has been the Commission's application pursuant to s 87(1B) of the Act for remedial orders on behalf of consumers under <case>(1A) of the Act in respect of the loss or damage suffered by those consumers by reason of the conduct in which Manfal is alleged to have engaged in contravention of s. 52A of the Act.

Section 87 provides both right and remedy. Upon the postulation in sub-s.
(1B) that, inter alia, a corporation has engaged in conduct in contravention of Pt. V of the Act by reason of which another person has suffered loss or damage or is likely to suffer loss or damage it confers a right upon the
Commission to make an application for remedial orders on behalf of the person so affected. The remedy is provided in s. 87(1A) pursuant to which, upon the exercise by the Commission of the right conferred upon it under sub-s. 87(1B), the Court may make such orders as the Court thinks appropriate against the person who engaged in the contravening conduct, or person who was involved in the contravention, as will compensate the person on whose behalf the application is made.

As pointed out in State of Western Australia v. Wardley Australia Ltd. &
Ors <case>; [(1991) 30 FCR 245] at 257, the legislation has as a primary objective the protection of perceived public interests. The rights of litigation provided by the Act are part of interlocking provisions of the Act designed to enforce, or gain adherence to, provisions of the Act intended to govern the conduct of corporations in trade or commerce and thereby serve the general public good. (See Fencott & Ors v. Muller & Anor [(1983) 152 CLR 570.)] 
That primary objective is probably made even more apparent in proceedings prosecuted by the Commission.

In the present litigation the five individual respondents are not persons to whom s. 52A of the Act applies. It is not contended that s. 6 of the Act extends the operation of s. 52A of the Act to any of those respondents.

Pursuant to sub-s. 87(1A) of the Act, the orders the Court may make by way of remedy may extend to and bind a person who has been involved in a contravention of s. 52A by Manfal if such is found to have occurred, but the right conferred by s. 87(1B) to make an application for such an order is entirely dependent upon proof that Manfal engaged in conduct which contravened s. 52A. In the absence of proof of such conduct by Manfal the Commission has no right to make an application under s. 87(1B) and the individual respondents are not liable to have an order made against them under s. 87(1A)." (at 384 - 385) 
Contrary to the opinion of the learned author of the text referred to, I understand Lee J to be stating that a condition precedent to entry into 87(1A) via 87(1B) is the establishment of proscribed conduct against a party as distinct from a party involved in such contravention: that once that condition is satisfied, <case>(1A) permits the Commission to bring the application against both the party engaged in the conduct in addition to any persons involved in that contravention. In any event, that is the way in which I see <case>(1B) operating in conjunction with <case>(1A). Further, if one views the section as a whole, I perceive no reasonable basis for drawing the distinction offered by the learned author in the case of a <case>(1B) grounded application as distinct from an application made directly under <case> or 87(1A). Consequently, subject to one further matter which was not argued before me, I think it is competent for the Commission to bring a <case>(1A) application via <case>(1B) for relief on behalf of the owners, both against the corporations found to have engaged in proscribed conduct and against the personal respondents involved in that contravention.

The further matter, which I think it is necessary to address, arises out of the terminology of <case>(1B) which on its face calls for: the institution of proceedings by the Commission under <case>, a finding that a person has engaged in proscribed conduct, the obtaining by the Commission of written consents to applications under s 87(1A) by persons affected by that proscribed conduct, 
In those circumstances "the Commission may make an application under sub- section (1A)". Strictly construed that sequence would preclude the bringing of an application by the Commission under <case>(1B) and <case>(1A) simultaneously as has been the procedure adopted by the Commission in these proceedings.
However, it is clear from cases such as Manfal that such a construction has not been regarded as the true construction of the sub-section: those cases have been brought along the lines of the Commission's application in these proceedings. Moreover, it occurs to me that, if the suggested sequence of events was required by <case>(1B), it could lead to situations in which the purpose of the section was defeated, depending upon the construction to be placed upon the limitation provisions of <case>(1CA). For that reason and, by implication, from decisions such as Manfal, I prefer the construction that permits the bringing of proceedings simultaneously by the Commission under ss (1B) and 87(1A).

The next question, to be addressed is whether the failure of the consent given by the owners to name the added respondents precludes the making of an order under <case>(1A) on behalf of the owners against the added respondents. In my view, the failure of the consents to name the added respondents is not fatal to the Commission's application against them under <case>(1A). I think it is sufficient to satisfy the consent requirements of <case>(1B) that the consent be in terms wide enough to encompass the recovery of damages against persons involved in the subject contravention, even though those persons so involved are not identified by name in the consent. In my opinion, the form of consent given by the owners in these proceedings is wide enough to encompass an application under <case>(1A) against the added respondents. The authority of the
Commission under the owners' consents to make an application under <case>(1A) is expressed in the widest of terms: it is to "apply for such orders as the
Commission considers appropriate to compensate (the owner) for the loss or damage suffered ..... as a result of the conduct of all or any of Collings
Construction Co Pty Ltd, Wayne Collings, Harry Kioussis and Venture Industries
Pty Ltd". Limiting that description of damage to that allegedly suffered as a result of the conduct of the corporate respondents, it is not suggested in these proceedings that the damages sought against the added respondents is any more than the damages said to have been caused by the corporate respondents in whose conduct each of the added respondents is said to have been involved.
Indeed it is alleged that the damages are the same. Consequently, it is my view that the Commission's application against the added respondents for loss or damage suffered by the owner as a result of the conduct of the corporate respondents and in which the added respondents were involved, is an application falling within the terms of the authority given by each of the owners.

The final question touching the validity of the Commission's application under s 87(1A) concerns the effect of the amendment by which the additional owners were made the subject of applications by the Commission under <case>(1A). The primary position of the respondents is that the amendment, being in the nature of one adding additional parties to the proceedings, takes effect from the date of the amendment and not from the date of the commencement of the proceedings. This argument may have some attraction to the respondents in the context of the position which they seek to adopt in relation to the operation of the limitations provision of <case>(1CA). Alternatively, the respondents submit that, if the amendment takes effect from the date of the filing of the application, then, the consents of the additional owners post dated the date of institution of the application and, therefore, were not consents "given before the application was made" within the meaning of <case>(1B). I do not propose to consider at this point whether the application to amend to include the additional owners took effect from the commencement of the application or from the date of the amendment. I think the answer to that question is irrelevant in considering whether <case>(1B) has been satisfied by the course adopted by the Commission. In my opinion, it is clear that the provisions of s (1B) have been satisfied by the obtaining of the consent of the additional owners before the making of the application for an amendment. Upon the facts of this case, for the purposes of <case>(1B), the application which shall not be made before the giving of the additional owners' consents is, alternatively, the application for leave to amend or, more likely, the amending of the principal application pursuant to leave so to amend. When that amendment is deemed to take effect is, in my opinion, immaterial.

Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the consents given by the owners to the
Commission satisfy the requirements of <case>(1B) and that the application on their behalf under <case>(1A) against all respondents is in conformity with s (1B) and <case>(1A).

General Factual Background 
The facts giving rise to these applications relate to contractual arrangements made at various times by consumers with Collings Construction and Venture for the design and construction of residential buildings based on the standard designs of Collings Construction (the project home design). The contractual arrangements relate to a period dating back to October 1988 through to approximately April 1992. In the owners' cases, design was performed by
Collings Construction, for which it was paid a design fee and, except for the
Quaglias' home, construction was performed under contract with the owners by
Venture. In all such cases, except that of the Staps, the defects in the buildings constructed by Venture were of such a nature as required demolition of Venture's work. The defects in the Staps' home were considerable.

Although the hearing of these proceedings occupied some fifty hearing days (including the hearing of the application for the order of reference, the hearing of the reference itself and of the adoption of the report), the length of the hearing was considerably curtailed by reason of concessions made by the respondents in relation to the nature and extent of defects affecting the owners' homes, by the reference of the remaining "building" issues to the referee and by admissions made on behalf of Venture that it was guilty of proscribed conduct and, by Kioussis, that he was involved in that contravention. However, these last mentioned admissions were somewhat limited.

As I understand the concessions made on behalf of Venture and Kioussis, there has been no attempt to justify the conduct attributed to them nor has any attempt been made to challenge the substance and accuracy of the attack made on them by the owners. However, in view of the claim for aggravated damages, or for vexation, and for injunctive relief against the Venture group, notwithstanding the concessions made on behalf of Venture and Kioussis, I think it is necessary to identify with some particularity the conduct attributed to them.
 
G. Summary of Commission's Case 
The case sought to be made by the Commission on behalf of the owners may be loosely paraphrased as one in which the Collings group offered to the owners a design and construct arrangement for a project home design in which the owners were led to believe that Collings Construction was responsible for the due performance of all aspects of the package. The arrangement with Collings
Construction was such that its obligations to the owners were brought to an end upon provision of council approved construction drawings for which the owners paid Collings Construction a deposit which Collings Construction labelled a non-refundable design fee. Collings Construction structured a contract price that was illusory in that the stated price was unreasonably low, subject to many exclusions of work, omissions and was based upon an unreasonable use of provisional sum items which, sometimes, had no sum allocated to the item. In some cases, the contract price related to a scope of works which already had been superseded thus exposing the owners to large payments for so called variations. Most of these matters were not brought to the attention of the owners or were inadequately notified by Collings
Construction.

Collings Construction then passed the owners over to Venture for the construction of the owners' home and, in doing so, retained no contractual control over Venture. In this way the owners, who had paid irrefundable deposits, were placed in a compromised position which enabled Venture to exploit the illusory price structure of the Collings Construction arrangement and to force upon the owners contractual arrangements which departed from the terms proposed by Collings Construction. These contracts facilitated, in most instances, the obtaining of an illegal deposit by Venture and permitted
Venture to make demands over and above the contract price for variations or provisional sum adjustments. Whereas Collings Construction held out Venture to be a builder of outstanding competence, Venture was completely incompetent.

In addition, Venture fraudulently induced the owners to enter into contractual arrangements with it by representations that Kioussis held a university degree in building (which he did not have), and by representations as to Venture's building competence which Venture did not have. Although Venture held itself out to be a reputable organisation in fact it was thoroughly disreputable as shown by its predatory behaviour towards the owners at time of entry into contracts with them and during performance of those contracts.

H. Introduction to the Conduct of the Respondents - The Aquilas 
The Commission set the stage for the case that was sought to be made against the respondents by calling evidence from Saverio Del'Aquila (Aquila) and his wife Diane Margaret Del'Aquila (D Aquila) (the Aquilas). In 1988, they purchased a residential block of land in suburban Sydney with the intention of constructing a home on the site. By reference to a publication known as the
Project Home Buyers Guide (the PHB guide), in which Collings Construction advertised, they came into contact with the Collings group. Objection was taken by the Venture group to the tender of the affidavits of the Aquilas on the basis that the subject matter was irrelevant. I admitted the affidavit material, other than that not read, in accordance with my ruling of 26 October which was as follows: " Objection is taken to the whole of this affidavit on behalf of the Venture group on the grounds of its irrelevance to these proceedings. The subject matter of the affidavit relates to the alleged dealings of Mr and Mrs
Dell'Aquila (sic) in 1988 with representatives of Collings Homes, in the course of which substantial payments were made by them, it is alleged, to the
Collings group in relation to the contract for the construction of a residence on their property.

The affidavit further deposes that following upon that payment they were introduced by the Collings representatives to Mr Harry Kioussis. The affidavit further describes how Mr Kioussis purported to increase the price quoted for the construction of the proposed homes by some $12,000 above that which was said to have been previously quoted by the Collings group.

The affidavit further attributes to Mr Kioussis the following statement: "There is no use going to him (referring to Mr Wayne Collings). You are finished with him. He only supplied the plan. You can't trust Wayne Collings.
If you back out now, you will do the $14,000 you have already paid but if you proceed with me it will come off the contract price, but you had better make a decision quickly as the building prices are going up". It was said that this material, in particular, is evidence going to what I have earlier described as the complicity issue and in this respect identifies the fact that Mr Kioussis was aware of the fact, if accepted, that persons introduced to him for the construction of a home by the Collings group were, in effect, already committed to the construction of a residence, having outlaid a substantial sum to the Collings group.

I think this material, if accepted, is probative of material relevant to the complicity issue and it is admitted accordingly. It is true that the evidence relates to a period some two years prior to the period with which the Court is concerned in relation to the dealings of the Venture group with the persons on whose behalf the plaintiff claims damages in these proceedings. Nevertheless,
I think the evidence is not robbed of probative value by that fact, nor by the fact that this evidence relates to one incident only. Accordingly, the affidavit will be exhibit AX." (T661.36 - 662.22) 
The complicity issue referred to in that ruling was a loose expression adopted during the course of the hearing to cover evidence of involvement of each of the corporate respondents in any contravention of the Act by the other and of the involvement of the personal respondents in those contraventions.

Nothing much turns on the admission into evidence of that of the Aquilas, except that it is an instructive introduction to the pattern of behaviour of the respondents in their dealings with the owners as featured in the
Commission's case above.

Some of these features, by no means all, were reflected in the evidence of the
Aquilas' dealing with the Collings group and the Venture group in 1988. There were some notable contractual differences in the documentation of the Aquilas' dealings with Collings Construction when compared with that relating to the owners.

The Aquilas initial contact with the Collings group was through the sales manager of Collings Construction, George Richards (Richards). This contact came about as a result of an advertisement in the PHB guide in which Collings
Construction advertised under the name Collings Homes with the representation that "Collings Homes build throughout N.S.W." 
In fact they built nowhere. Collings' father had been a successful builder in association with J Collings from 1953 until his death in 1985. They established Collings Construction in 1963, and in later years, concentrated on the construction of residential buildings which were designed by Collings
Construction and were marketed with the aid of exhibition homes constructed by
Collings Construction. After the death of his father, Collings became general manager of Collings Construction and a co-director with J Collings. With the building activities of Collings Construction coming to an end, it surrendered its builder's licence to the Corporation in 1989. Throughout the whole of the period Collings Construction was a member of the Master Builders Association (the MBA).

In the PHB guide Collings Homes was described as being "30 Years in Building" and possessing a quoted builders licence number. This would have been correct at the time of dealings between Collings Constructions and the Aquilas. The evidence of Collings, which I accept, is that he had requested the PHB guide publishers to remove this reference to a building licence number when Collings
Construction ceased to be a builder: that his request had been overlooked, a matter that only came to his attention and was corrected after his return from overseas in 1990.

Up to the point of entering into contractual arrangements with Collings
Construction the Aquilas dealt with Richards. These dealings involved comparatively minor changes to the project home design, resulting in the submission of a tender letter by Collings Construction to the Aquilas dated 19
November 1988 (the quotation) together with documents entitled "Summary of
Quotation" (the summary) and "Work Additionals Outside Tender Letter", (work additionals) respectively. It appeared from these documents that the price for the project home design of $93,732 was increased as a result of the particular requirements of the Aquilas to $101,752. There were a number of features of the quotation which were common to the dealings of Collings Construction with the owners. The quotation began as a formal acknowledgment of a request for a quotation and then described Collings Construction as a "family based Company that has been in operation for over thirty-five years ... (specialising) in designing luxury homes ... constructed by one of our Associate Franchise
Builders who have a reputation for excellence and are true craftsmen in the real sense of the word".

The quoted figure, in this case of $101,752, was stated to be "subject to the position of the building on the block and associated levels being confirmed by a Surveyor, the standard engineers and Architectural details being used and the drainage system and plans being approved by Council and Water Board".

The summary enumerated some sixteen items, most, if not all, of which were in the nature of provisional sum items. In some cases a provisional sum was stipulated in others the column for the insertion of a sum for a provisional sum item was left blank. It is a matter of complaint in these proceedings that the recourse by Collings Construction to the use of provisional sum items was excessive, unnecessary and part of a course of conduct designed to undermine the ultimate validity of the quotation price and such as to enable the builder, to whom the owners were directed by Collings Construction, to manipulate things so as to recover from the owners money under the building contract greatly in excess of the quoted price. The provisional sum items in the Aquilas' summary corresponded with items in the summaries submitted by
Collings Construction to the owners. The varied report found that these items, with few exceptions, should have been included in the contract price and not made subject to adjustment as was permitted by the technique resorted to by
Collings Construction. In treating the items as provisional, I have no doubt that this technique was deliberately resorted to by Collings Construction in order to enable it to offer what appeared to be a firm contract price, within budget, and which was highly competitive, but which, in reality, was probably below the price which would permit a builder's profit to be made or full recovery of the builder's costs. It was clearly capable of exploitation by an unscrupulous builder as a means of recovering sums significantly in excess of the quoted contract price.

Collings Construction extracted significant payments from the Aquilas once agreement had been reached on price. The Aquilas paid Collings Construction $14,000: $1,500 eight days after the quotation; another $3,500 followed by $9,000 prior to entry into a contract with Venture.

Upon receipt of this quotation there were some further adjustments to the quoted price which brought it to $99,632. There was some delay in finalising council approval of the plans, the reasons for which are unnecessary to examine. During the course of these dealings Richards had stated to the
Aquilas that Collings Construction would be the builder of their home and it would operate through sub-contractors and maintain complete control of the project.

The introduction of the Aquilas to Venture by Collings Construction took place at the latter's office on 17 April 1989 where they were introduced to Kioussis by Collings who then left the room whereupon the following took place: "47. Harry Kioussis ("Harry") presented to Sam and me a contract which I noted was between Sam and me and Venture Homes Pty Limited. Either Sam or I said "We are surprised that we are now contracting with another company." Harry said "That there has been a death in the Collings family and it was this person who held the licence, therefore another builder has to take over this project and this is quiet (sic) a common practice." Harry also said "I can't build the house for the price quoted to you by Collings Construction, the new price will be $113,150.00. This is the reason it has taken so long to meet me because I have had to go through and work out the costs all over again." On being given this advice both Sam and I were very upset. I said "Where are we going to find another $10,000.00?" During this meeting I became very emotional and at stages ended up in tears.
Harry said "there is no point in complaining to Wayne he can't do anything if you back out now you will do the $14,000.00 you have already paid.
Either Sam or I said "We will need time to think about this." Harry said "The longer you delay the greater the possibility the contract price will increase." " (Pars 47 and 48 of Exhibit AY, the affidavit of D Aquila) 
I accept this evidence which, I think, clearly demonstrates that, at the time that Venture dealt with the owners, Kioussis was well aware that they had paid or were committed to pay a significant design fee to Collings Construction, a fee which was regarded as irrefundable. This evidence of Kioussis' conduct fits into a pattern of behaviour by Kioussis acting on behalf of Venture in his dealings with the owners. It is not surprising that the conduct of
Kioussis in his initial contact with the Aquilas reduced D Aquila to tears. It is hard to escape the inference that Collings deliberately excused himself from this confrontation.

The dealings by the Collings group and the Venture group with the individual owners followed a similar pattern with Collings Construction and Venture respectively entering into separate contractual relationships with each of the
Staps, Corbetts, Smiths, Grimstons, Tantis and Ferrises: while the Qauglias entered into contractual relationships with Collings Constructions they declined to sign a building contract with Venture.

I. Conduct of Respondents
The Corbetts 
The Corbetts' claim should be examined first amongst the several claims of the owners as they had entered into contractual arrangements with both Collings
Construction and Venture by October 1990 and I regard the events concerning that claim in that period as having a particular significance when the time comes to examine the respective claims of the other owners. The commencement of dealings by the other owners with Venture covered a period from April to
October 1991. I think the timing of the Corbetts' dealing with Collings
Construction and Venture is significant in its capacity to fix the Collings group with knowledge of conduct of the Venture group of which complaint is now made by the owners.

In 1986 the Corbetts contracted with Collings Construction for the construction of a residence at the outer Sydney suburb of St Clair. They had been satisfied with the performance of Collings Construction for that contract. In January 1990 they sold that property and a short time later purchased another property for $130,000 in a suburb known as Silverdale (the
Silverdale property). This property was undeveloped and it was their intention to construct a residential building on it for occupation by them as their home. They initially explored the costs of constructing a pre-fabricated style steel frame home through an organisation trading under the name of Nu-Steel
Homes (Nu-Steel). This was in about June 1990. They then inspected an exhibition home of Collings Construction at a building display centre (Home
World) situated at Prospect, in outer Sydney. The building was marketed by
Collings Construction as the Louisiana. There was an advertisement at the site which read "Collings Homes your personal builder". They there discussed with
Richards the possibility of Collings Construction building their home along the lines of rough plans which they brought to the site and showed Richards. I do not understand there to be any issue that the conduct of Richards was the conduct of Collings Construction as provided by <case> of the Act. It is clear, in my opinion, that Richards, at all relevant times, was acting on behalf of
Collings Construction and within the scope of his actual and apparent authority as sales manager of Collings Construction.

At this inspection by the Corbetts, Collings involved himself in discussions with them. During the course of these discussions the Corbetts were given a document entitled "Collings Marketing Guide" (the marketing guide). That document contained statements concerning Collings Construction similar to those statements which appeared in the PHB guide. It was described as "YOUR
PERSONAL BUILDER" and in relation to a series of buildings described under various trade names such as "Louisiana" listed various prices under a heading "DELUXE PRICE". The marketing guide, listed the items included in the "ADVERTISED DELUXE PRICE" in some details. Those items embraced some rather obvious elements of a building and of particular installations. There were some provisional sum items listed which received no particular emphasis and their detection called for some careful reading of the list. The "DELUXE
PRICE" was described as "the basic price of all quotations".

Numerous items were listed under a heading entitled "CUSTOM FEATURES DISPLAYED &/OR AVAILABLE NOT INCLUDED IN DELUXE PRICE" and in respect of many of those items a price was quoted.

By arrangement, the Corbetts met Collings again about 8 July 1990 which was the date of documents given to the Corbetts by Collings at that meeting. There was a letter of quotation (the first quotation), a Summary of Quotation (the first summary) and the schedule of "WORK ADDITIONALS OUTSIDE TENDER LETTER" (the first work additionals). Set out below in full is the first quotation from which will be seen that there are many aspects of it common to the
Aquilas' quotation, the most notable difference being that, in the case of the
Aquilas, the quotation was for one lump sum which, presumably, included the design fee of Collings Construction, whereas, the first quotation was broken up into a fee payable to Collings Construction and building costs. The first quotation was as follows: "Dear Mr & Mrs Corbett

The first quotation was signed by Collings as general manager of Collings
Construction whose letterhead appeared on the letter together with an insignia designating it as a member of the MBA.

At this meeting Collings produced plans prepared by Collings Construction based on the material previously supplied by the Corbetts together with a plan of the Louisiana building identified as "MODEL - EC17H". In reverse, the plan of the Louisiana was very similar to the plan produced by Collings based upon the Corbett's requirements: except in the latter case the plan contained significantly larger and additional areas.

There are a number of matters that may be noted in respect of the material so submitted by Collings at this meeting.
The marketing guide, in effect, repeated the descriptive statements of
Collings Construction which appeared in the PHB guide.
The first quotation, offered a package of "costs" in the sum of $108,749 which was broken into a building fee of $88,621 and a "non-refundable" design fee of $20,128. Although the first quotation commented that Collings
Construction specialised in "designing homes" its description in the letterhead as a member of the MBA, even its name or style, its offering of a quotation for building and design, I think, clearly conveyed a very strong impression of control by Collings Construction over both aspects of the package, namely, building and design. I do not regard that impression as removed by the statement that the actual building work would be performed by "one of our independent Franchise Builders". The description of those builders as "one of our builders" conveyed some aspect of control as did resort to the description of "Franchise Builders". Although the evidence of the Corbetts and of the other owners was that they regarded Collings Construction as the building organisation, I think that overstated their true understanding of the position which I accept was one in which they did not expect to enter into a separate contract with a builder to which Collings Construction was not a party. I have no doubt that the Corbetts were misled into believing that they were dealing with one organisation, namely, Collings Construction: that in some undefined way Collings Construction would effect the construction of their respective homes by retaining an appropriately skilled builder, which in some undesignated way was part of the Collings Construction organisation.
In the events that occurred in relation to the Corbetts, I am of the opinion that the description of the Collings Construction "independent
Franchise Builders" as having "a reputation for excellence and (were) true craftsmen in the real sense of the word" was beyond mere puffery and was quite unjustified in the case of Venture.
It was part of the Collings Construction contracting strategy to engender pressure on the owners to sign an agreement with Collings Construction in a matter of days after the submission of the first quotation. Those contractual arrangements obligated the owners to pay Collings Construction's quite substantial design fees which Collings Construction treated as irrefundable - by which I understand Collings Construction to mean that, once there was a commitment to that fee, regardless of whether the owner proceeded with the construction of the subject project, the fee remained the entitlement of
Collings Construction.
The first summary was constructed on a basic price for the model EC17H. to which were added a number of provisional sum adjustments, resulting in, what was described as a "Contract Price" of $88,621.
The summary did not include the work additionals of approximately $80,000.
The summary contract price was, in my opinion, quite illusory. One is minded to regard a contract price as firm and, upon payment of which, specified works will be constructed in a timely and workmanlike way. The referee considered each of those designated provisional sum items and in the varied report, ss 1.2.4 and 1.3.4, it was found that nine of the fourteen provisional sum items could and would have been quantified by a reasonable builder and included as part of a firm contract price. I regard this aspect of the dealings by the Collings group with the owner as a deliberate recourse to a contractual mechanism which would: i) protect the builder, whoever it may be, from the consequences of incompetence or indifference in estimating provisional sums, ii) permit recourse by the builder to claims for sums above the contract price in respect of provisional sum items to which no estimate or no proper quantification had been made by Collings Construction, iii) permit Collings Construction to offer a contract price which was within the prospective client's budget, and superficially, highly competitive, but which, in reality, was illusory and susceptible to significant increases.
Dealing with a customer whose funds were limited, and dependent usually on loan facilities, I regard this technique of Collings Construction as cynical in its treatment of the customer. For most people it would have been quite misleading to describe the price as a `contract price'.
The inclusion of items as provisional, but for which no sum was allocated, represented an open invitation to the contracting builder to charge an increase, at will, over the so called contract price upon performance of the item during the course of the works. These items included handling, area loading, extra cost of concrete in respect of pier, step and beams, use of concrete pump, rock excavation, extra cost of brick work, of wall and floor tiling and of drainage. What constituted "extra" when no quantities had been taken out for the standard design was anyone's guess.
The first work additionals were quite extraordinary in that they included a sum which almost doubled the contract price by providing for the additional cost of one item in the sum of $78,593. The work additionals worked in two ways: i) As stated above, they formed no part of the contract price stipulated in the summary causing the `contract price' to be grossly understated.
 ii) When the time comes to examine the contractual arrangements with Venture, it will be seen that the owners were required to pay the value of work additionals as variations within seven days of signing the contract with
Venture. It was a means of getting an additional deposit from the owners: this was in addition to an "Initial additional payment of 10% deposit within 7 days of signing of the contract". By an amendment to the BSC Act it was made an offence to demand or receive a payment or to enter into a contract involving the payment of a deposit of more than five percent of the contract price when that price was in excess of $20,000. That amendment came into effect on 4
February 1991 so that, while it had no bearing on the Venture contract with the Corbetts, it was in force during the remaining contractual dealings by
Venture with the other owners.

The Corbetts did not accept the first quotation and, after some further negotiations in the week following the discussion of the quotation, there was a meeting between Collings and the Corbetts on 18 July 1990 when a slight reduction in price was accepted by Collings, some comparatively minor extras were discussed and Collings submitted a further quotation letter (the second quotation), a summary (the second summary) and work additionals, (the second work additionals) each dated 8 July 1990. The second quotation was in the same terms as the first except that it offered to keep the price offered for seventy-five days rather than sixty. The second summary was substantially the same as the first, although four items appear to had been deleted against which there have been no sums allocated. The second work additionals is an interesting document in that it repeated the schedule in the first work additionals, but purported to treat the item entitled "additional area as per
Owner's Plan": as a provisional sum. This did not escape the attention of
Corbett and he caused Collings to delete that reference. I do not regard that attempt to change the nature of that item to a provisional sum item as accidental or innocent. I think it was a deliberate attempt to convert a lump sum contract for what it was worth into a cost plus contract having regard to the amount of the proposed provisional sum, nearly $80,000. That action by
Collings, as much as anything, demonstrates to me the thinking behind the resort to provisional sums in setting up contractual commitments with the respective owners. The fact that it was deleted at the instigation of Corbett, in my opinion, merely reflects the fact that it was a failed attempt by
Collings to further erode the contract price as a realistic price.

Eight further items were added to the second work additionals, four of which were noted as not being the subject of any charge, but two provided for extras as follows: "2 Bay Windows (dining and study) $1,580.00 Windows to Billiard (extra) $580.00" 
Those items do not have any immediate significance but they gain some point in the context of Venture's dealings with the Corbetts.

At this meeting of 18 July 1990 the Corbetts accepted the Collings
Construction second quotation as adjusted by the second summary and the second work additionals and paid a deposit of $1,000. I accept the evidence of the
Corbetts that they believed that Collings Construction was the contractor and that the work of actual construction would be given to a franchise builder, whatever that term meant. However, contractually, Corbett considered that he was entitled to look to Collings Construction for the provision of the building as agreed upon. He treated the division of the "costs" in the second quotation letter as being a provision for the payment of a deposit in the form of the fee to Collings Construction. I accept that evidence and note that in the second quotation it was not stated that the sum of $88,621 would be paid to a third party. Those documents simply set out the fact that the work was to be performed by an "independent franchise builder". Similarly the second summary does not carry any indication that the schedule of costs there set out were to be paid to a third party, the same may be said of the second work additionals.

On the back of the second summary there was a printed set of "SPECIAL
CONDITIONS & REQUIREMENTS". Those conditions included a provision that: "The cost of concrete piers, rock excavation, sewer pipes, storm water pipes and all other items listed as Provisional Sums will be adjusted after the actual cost is known." 
Provision was made for a mark up of twenty-five per cent by "the master builder" in relation to "prime cost or provisional sums included in the specification and/or tender".

Cls 7 and 8 were in the following terms: "7. Collings Construction Company reserves the right to nominate their sub- contractors at all times and in all circumstances. Further, this choice shall in no way be effected by the client.
The provisional sums are not an estimate of the cost" 
There was evidenced a specification which was submitted by Collings
Constructions to the responsible authority for building approval of the subject dwelling which identified the builder as Collings Construction. It is not clear whether this specification was actually shown to the Corbetts. The specifications provided for concrete footings "where shown on plan". Evidence disclosed that, in addition to the architect's plan of the residence, there was produced by Collings Construction an engineer's drawing by Gerald Henry
Larkins (Larkins), an engineer retained through Collings Construction. He was a structural and civil consulting engineer who worked for Collings
Construction for approximately sixteen years until 1992, from which time he received no further instructions from the Collings Group. The arrangement was never reduced to writing. He received a copy of architectural plans for a proposed residence with oral instructions "to prepare the Engineer's Details, usually a Slab Plan and Details". He prepared engineer's details for the proposed dwellings for each of the owners. Larkins was called by the
Commission and he gave evidence that, where a house site required cut and fill, footings that would require the provision of piers. The Corbetts' site was an example of this. Accordingly, the structural plan prepared by Larkins for the Corbetts' residence and submitted to council showed concrete slab and pier details and the architectural plan submitted to council was endorsed with the following note: "R. C. Slab & Footings to Engineer's Detail" 
It is clear from those drawing details that the price quoted to the Corbetts by Collings Construction, inevitably, was subject to increase by the cost of footings built in accordance with Larkins' details.

The evidence of Corbett is that this was not brought to his attention. While accepting that cost of the residence built for the Corbetts by Collings
Construction in 1985 was adjusted by increased cost of footings, Corbett insisted that the likelihood or possibility of such additional costs being incurred in the performance of the Collings Construction 1990 contract was at no time brought to his attention by Collings Construction. It was the evidence of Corbett that Collings informed him on 30 July 1990 that the only adjustment in respect of provisional sum items applied only to those items where a provisional sum was allocated. In the second summary no sum had been allocated to footings. Collings disputed that version and gave evidence of a detailed explanation to the Corbetts concerning the provisional sum items and in particular cost of concrete piers and beams Collings claimed to have told
Corbett at the meeting of 8 July that: "Well, you'll have to almost for sure do piering and beaming depending how reactive the ground is and how deep you've got to drill the piers to. Also you might strike shale when excavating for the slab and the drainage line and septic tank. As always we've based the tender on a standard slab for a stable site." 
Further, that, when asked by Corbett as to the likelihood of extras, he replied in the following terms: "Well, only what we've already talked about. There's the usual adjustment for concrete piers and rock and sewer etc., once they're drilled. You'll probably be asked by the builder to check the piers. We don't know what the cost of the piers and rock is going to be, so we've simply described them as provisional sum items and they're, as I said to you before, done on a measure and charge basis." 
To which the Corbetts were said to have replied, that they realised that.

I think this evidence disclosed knowledge on the part of Collings of the need for piers and increased cost of footings for the Corbetts' residence. In contrast with this, no provision was made for it in the first or second quotation. I do not accept that Collings conveyed information to the Corbetts that such additional costs would be incurred in relation to provisional sum items, in particular, to the provisional sum items for footings for which no provisional sum was allowed.

Collings cross-examined Corbett on this particular matter. The evidence of
Corbett, I think, was quite convincing. Collings drew Corbett's attention to the special condition on the back sheet of the second summary concerning the adjustment for the cost of footings and then addressed the following questions to Corbett: "Q. Does that imply to you that the amount is not known, in other words when you read the statement does that imply to you well it is not known but eventually it will be known and when it is known then the cost will be adjusted in the future when it is known, is that what that means to you? 
A. Well not from the way you explained to us at the time.

Q. So are you saying that I said to you that all the piers are included in the price? 
A. When you went through the provisional sum that is you said the only provisional sums that we had were the provisional sums with an amount beside it. That was a provisional sum which would le (sic) adjusted when it was known and that all the items without a provisional sum was included in the price and that is how it was described by me to you.

Q. But didn't I say to you things about clay and shale and slope of the site and that, you know, it's going to be on piers of course just like the first time when you built your home but we are not quite sure what it is going to be and it will be adjusted when the cost is known, didn't I say that? 
A. No.

Q. Didn't I say that if you go putting a figure down there of 1,000 or 2,000 dollars for the piers and the rock that may be the piers will turn out to be $10,000 and it is no point putting up a figure of $2,000 down there if the thing is going to end up $10,000? 
A. No, you didn't.

Q. Didn't I talk to you about an old filled dam site possibility? 
A. No.

Q. I put to you that, I gave you a choice of having site costs fixed, the worst possible case of actual cost including some measuring charge system actual cost plus 25 cents? 
A. I was never offered a fixed price, no, so - 
Q. I put to you that the reason you c hose the actual cost plus 25% is because you reasoned that if there was no rock on that system you would not have to pay for any rock. If it was on the fixed - if we fixed the cost we were going to charge $1,000 or $2,000 or fixed prices $15,000 or so, so you had a choice of fixed or provisional sum and I put it to you the reason you chose the provisional charge actual cost plus 25% is because you reasoned that if you took fixed then we would have maybe two or three thousand dollars in there fixed for rock and even if there was not any rock you would still have to pay ,000-odd or 3,000-odd dollars whereas on actual costs plus 25% you reasoned quite correctly that if there was no rock you would not have to pay for rock.
I put to you that I gave you that choice and you preferred the provisional sum actual cost of 25% system because if the items don't happen you don't have to pay for piers but if there were piers then you only paid an actual cost plus %? 
A. No, I never had the choice either way." (T479.52 -480 .53) 
Further negotiations on price took place between Corbett and Collings on 18
July 1990, following which the Corbetts met Collings and Richards on 28 July at Collings Construction office. Richards produced a form of contract known as the BC3 - October 1965 edition, being a document, copyright for which was held by the MBA (the BC3 contract). This document bore the name Venture
Industries Pty Ltd and details of a builders licence where provision was made for the insertion of such particulars. It was the evidence of Corbett, which I accept, that the contract executed by the Corbetts at this meeting did not have those sections completed. The Corbetts' evidence was that the document was described by Richards as a standard contract and that the work would be performed by Collings Construction. The contract was executed by the Corbetts at this meeting. It was their evidence that it would not have been executed had it been made clear that Collings Construction did not intend to be responsible for the building works under their contract.

At this meeting of 28 July 1990 the Corbett's understanding of the nature of the fee being paid to Collings Construction as a deposit was consistent with the statement by Richards to him at that meeting, namely: "When council approves the plans you'll have to pay a deposit for the house of $20,128" 
At that meeting Richards also requested a further payment of $3,000 "for the cost of the plans being drawn up". This amount was paid on 30 July 1990.

In respect of items for which a provisional sum had been allocated, Corbett understood that sum represented a reasonable estimate of the work to be performed and that there would only be an adjustment if costs were incurred over and above such a reasonable sum. Further, in respect of items described as provisional, but for which no sum was allocated, he understood those items to be included in the contract price and not subject to adjustment. He stated that this was confirmed in a conversation with Richards on 30 July 1990 when paying the second amount of his deposit.

In late September Corbett was informed by Collings that the plans had been approved by Council and Corbett was requested to attend at the office of
Collings Construction with the contract which had been given to him on 28 July
Corbett attended as requested on 29 September 1990. In the early part of that meeting Richards was the only representative of Collings Construction present. He accepted a cheque for $20,180, being the Collings Construction fee, but which Corbett continued to understand to be a deposit and he so described it when handing over the cheque for that amount. Richards gave
Corbett a receipt for that sum which was described as "Final Payment".
Corbett's evidence, which I accept, is that he did not notice that endorsement. He simply pocketed the receipt when it was handed to him.
Richards then arranged for Corbett to sign another document which Richards described as a copyright agreement. After this had taken place, Collings joined the meeting and requested the contract which Corbett had brought to the meeting. What then followed is described by Corbett as follows: " I gave Wayne the documents as requested. Wayne now had three sets of documents in front of him and he said, "This is yours (and handed me back a set of documents)." 
He folded another set up and said, "This is our copy to keep here." 
He then folded the other set up and said, "This is for Harry." 
Wayne said, "We will be handing you over to Harry Kioussis and I'll arrange a meeting for you with Harry at Bankstown in his office." 
When Collings Construction constructed the first house for my wife and I in about 1986, the contract documents and drawings, and associated documents, were given to the foreman for Collings and, thereafter, most of our dealings were with the foreman. On that basis, I assumed that when Wayne Collings said to me that he was handing me over to Harry Kioussis, that Harry was a foreman for Wayne. I still believed the contract I had for constructing the house was with Wayne or his company.

The copy of the BC3 that I handed to Wayne Collings was the copy of annexure
PJC 13 as referred to in paragraph 32 above, that had no reference in it to Venture Industries Pty Limited. I cannot recall when I first became aware of the fact that the document he gave me in return, at that meeting, had the name "Venture Industries P/L" and other details referrable to the Master
Builder and Master Builders Licence, on page 1.
Wayne did not say that Harry Kioussis was with Venture Industries Pty
Ltd. Wayne said, "Harry is the most qualified builder that I've got. I'll arrange a date for you to meet with him at Bankstown." 
Alison and I then left.

Within the next seven days Wayne rang me and said, "A meeting has been arranged with Harry." " (Pars 38 and 39 of Exhibit AH) 
I accept the evidence of the Corbetts that they would not have proceeded with their arrangements with Collings Construction nor with Venture had they realised the true situation concerning the manner in which the contractual relations and the contract price were structured or had they known that
Venture was not competent to construct their home.

The Corbetts' meeting with Kioussis was no less auspicious than the experience of the Aquilas in their dealings with Kioussis. By arrangement effected by
Collings Construction, the Corbetts met Kioussis at the premises of Venture at
Bankstown in early October 1990. It was then apparent to the Corbetts that they had been sent to an organisation separate from Collings Construction.
Nevertheless, Corbett retained the belief that Collings Constructions retained control over the project and of Venture. It was not in issue that displayed in
Venture's office was a forged university degree in building.

In this first meeting Kioussis displayed a contemptuous attitude toward the interests of the Corbetts under their contract, an approach which was to be repeated on a number of occasions either by him or P Kioussis during the course of construction of the Corbetts' residence. I think that attitude is captured in the following evidence of Corbett of this first meeting with
Kioussis: "Harry had plans and other documents on his desk, one page was opened and
Alison said to me, "Look, it only says two vanities and two showers." 
I said, "How come only two when we've got three bathrooms?" 
Harry said, "in the plans you only get two bathrooms, that extra bathroom that you wanted is just an empty room, if you want your vanity, an extra toilet and shower then that's extra." 
I said, "It's in the plan as being a third bathroom and you're telling us we just get an empty room?" 
Harry said, "Yes, that's all you get. You'll also have to pay for the items which Wayne said would be no charge." 
I did not directly challenge Kioussis about these matters as my understanding was that it was Wayne Collings who was in ultimate control of the project." (Par 43, Exhibit AH) 
Corbett immediately contacted Collings over this matter. The evidence of
Collings and Corbett did not differ materially in their version of the events which followed Corbett's complaint of Kioussis' behaviour. Collings contacted
Kioussis and extracted from him an assurance that Venture would adhere to the contractual arrangements reached by Collings Construction with the Corbetts.
Nevertheless a measure of Corbetts' disenchantment with those events can be gauged from his demand for the return of the moneys paid by the Corbetts to
Collings Constructions. Collings resisted that and prevailed upon the Corbetts to proceed with the project.

The problem with Kioussis appears to have been settled a few days later at a meeting attended by Collings, Richards, Kioussis and the Corbetts at Collings
Construction's office. The evidence of Corbett, which I accept, is that the
Corbetts were requested by Richards to wait, which they did for approximately an hour, while Kioussis and Collings discussed matters in another office.
Corbett described the circumstances as follows: "Alison and I went to Homeworld to attend the meeting arranged by Wayne. When we walked into Wayne's office George was in the front room and he said, "Wayne and Harry are out the back having a meeting. Could you wait here please." 
George stayed with us and we waited for about half an hour. After about an hour Harry and another person walked out straight past Alison and myself and he did not acknowledge us. I don't know who the other person was with Harry, however he had on a suit. Wayne then came out and said, "Let's sit down and talk. Harry has agreed to abide by the terms and conditions." 
I believed that this meant that Harry would construct the house as agreed by me with Wayne. Wayne said, "Harry has now signed a contract and the only thing Harry wants is that he be paid like this." 
Wayne then showed me a document titled "Annexure A". I do not have a copy of the document shown to me, however annexed and marked "PJC 17" is a copy of a document similar to the one shown to me by Wayne. Neither myself or Alison had signed it at this time. I said, "If he's agreed to everything, I'll agree to pay him that way." 
Wayne said, "I've arranged another meeting with Harry, it's arranged for tomorrow after lunch at Harry's place and George will go with you to make sure everything is okay." 
I said, "We'll meet George there." 
Alison and I then left." (Par 45, Exhibit AH) 
The document referred to as `Annexure A' provided for a method of payment which involved payment of 10 per cent deposit together with the value of the work additionals which were to be paid within seven days of signing a contract with Venture.

As arranged with Collings, the Corbetts resumed their dealings with Kioussis and attended Kioussis' office on 26 October 1990 for the purpose of completing contractual arrangements with Venture. At this meeting a number of documents were signed by the Corbetts. Prior to executing these documents, Kioussis gave the Corbetts to understand that they were standard BC3 contract conditions and the arrangement they were entering into was in accordance with that reached with Collings Construction. One of the documents signed was passed off by
Kioussis as simply a document in "plain english (sic)" that explained the BC3 contract (the plain english document). It was anything but a plain english document which explained the standard BC3 contract. The Corbetts also signed the marketing guide, a contract in printed form of the BC3 contract, a document entitled "SPECIAL CONDITIONS TO CONTRACT DATED"(the special conditions), a specification, a plan identified as "DRAWING NO. 1 MODEL: EC17H
PLAN NO. 6A", a plan entitled "DRAWING NUMBER 2" and a "SLAB PLAN &
DETAILS AS APPROVED BY THE COUNCIL", a document entitled "Tender" which purported to dissect the contract price of $167,214 into the basic price of the project home design, certain provisional sums and items together with the sum of $78,593 which had been agreed upon in relation to the item described as "Additional area as per owners' plan" and a document entitled "Variations and
Work Additionals".

The overall contractual arrangements between Venture and the Corbetts could not reasonably be described as a standard BC3 contract and its provisions are in some significant respects quite confusing even to a person familiar with building contracts. In the provision for "SPECIAL CONDITIONS" in the BC3 contract, the following documents were incorporated: "1. Venture Industries Pty Limited Trading as Venture Homes tender letter dated 18.10.90.
Standard Construction Drawing.
Detail Drawing.
Architectural Construction Drawing and site drawing.
Engineer Drawing
Specification.
Annexure A, Attached.
Special Conditions, item 1-28, attached.
Marketing Guide dated 1st May 1990." (p 12 of annexure PJC 18 to Exhibit AH) 
The drawings there referred to are drawings which were attached to the contract and signed by Kioussis and the Corbetts. It is not an easy task to determine the contractual significance of the reference to those drawings in the special conditions and their attachment to the printed form of contract.
In the printed form drawings are defined to mean "the drawings .... referred to in the Articles of Agreement to which these conditions are expressed to be annexed". Those drawings were described in the Articles of Agreement as "Drawings Prepared by Collings Construction Co. No. 2" as approved by the
Council. However, in the document entitled "SPECIAL CONDITIONS TO CONTRACT
DATED", cl 12 provided as follows: "Condition 29 hereof shall be deemed to have been amended by adding thereto the following sub-condition (d):- "29(d) The Contract Drawing shall mean the standard model master plan" 
Since I understand the standard model plan to refer to Collings Construction model plan EC17H, it is not immediately apparent what function is played by the other drawings referred to in the special conditions. This ambiguity extends over to the terms of the plain english document which included a provision that: "The cost of amended plans is a variation to contract and is to be paid within seven days of signing of contract" 
It was a further provision of the special conditions as follows: "Any item on the final amended plan not on the Contract Drawings shall be deemed to be extra work requested by the proprietor and to be paid for according to the conditions stipulated by the Builder" 
It is far from clear what is regarded as the "final amended plan" and what drawings comprised the "Contract Drawings" having regard to the definitions to which I have referred.

The same document together with the tender document listed numerous provisional sum or prime cost items. The varied report in relation to some thirty such items, found that fifteen should have been assessed by a reasonable builder and included in the contract sum.

A provision in the special conditions which is clearly capable of abuse in the hands of an unscrupulous builder was in the following terms: "Works must be suspended until any dispute is resolved to the agreement of the client and Builder" 
Despite the assurance by Kioussis that the variations and work additionals document was in accordance with the arrangement made by the Corbetts with
Collings Construction, the documents signed by the Corbetts departed significantly from that arrangement. By way of illustration, the items which appeared in the second work additionals included: "2 bay windows (dining & study) $1,580 windows to billiard (extra) $580", 
Those items appeared in the Venture variation and work additionals document with the word "each" interposed before the amount and so doubling the cost of the variation. Similarly, an entry entitled "T. L. 3 Doors to entry", which appeared in the second work additionals as an item for which no additional charge was to be made, appeared as a variation to be paid for in the Venture variation and work additionals document.

A comparison of the Collings Construction contract documents with those produced by Venture throws up quite significant differences. The Venture contract documents provided for several variations, several provisional sum provisions and other contract changes which do not appear in the Collings
Construction documents.

Richards, who was present at this meeting and who preceded the Corbetts to it, made no attempt to correct this erroneous statement of Kioussis.

In respect of the contract price of $167,214 plus the work additionals, the varied report found that a reasonable builder would have tendered a contract price in the sum of $204,750 to $208,911, dependent on standard of finish. I have little doubt that the contract price as stipulated by Collings
Construction and Venture was grossly inadequate and could only have been stipulated in the knowledge that the excessive use of provisional sum and prime cost items and the scope for variation claims would permit a recovery of a significantly greater sum than that stipulated as the contract sum in the contract documents executed by the Corbetts with Collings Construction and
Venture.

At this meeting of 26 October 1990 the Corbetts paid Venture $19,200 at the request of Kioussis, that being made up of 10 percent of the contract price and the amount of the work additionals, a total of $19,181 which was rounded off to $19,200.

At the same meeting Kioussis informed the Corbetts that portion of the monies paid by them to Collings Construction had to be accounted for to Venture as part of the contract price. The reason for this accounting was not explained to the Corbetts.

The construction of the Corbetts' residence was under the supervision of P
Kioussis with the work commencing in the last week of November 1990. The first variation was submitted by Venture on 4 December 1990 in the sum of $2,640 for: "Amended Plans $1,920 
Engineer Drawings $480 
Long Service Levy $240 
OUR COST FOR THE ABOVE IS $2,640 " 
Justification for this variation was offered by P Kioussis on the basis that the Corbetts plans "were amended from the "Louisiana" " and that the payment to Collings Construction "were only for standard plans". That claim on the face of it was unjustified. Alternatively, it was an extra known at the time of contract but excluded from the contract price and knowledge of it withheld from the Corbetts. Two weeks later the Corbetts received another variation claim, this time in the sum of $1,940 for site excavation and preparation. A day later two further variation claims were submitted for $8,330 for the pouring of concrete to piers and $16,840 for extra concrete and steel in the footings. When these claims were challenged by Corbett the following exchange took place between Corbett and the Venture group: ".......I telephoned Harry and said, "I've got two concrete bills for the house for extra cost." 
Harry said, "That's Penny job, if you want to know about any variations you speak to her as she's the supervisor." 
Harry then transferred me to Penny. I said, "How can you justify this cost for extra concrete. Can I have an invoice to prove the costs?" 
Penny said, "You are not entitled to see any of the subbies' invoices and you must make payment within seven days or else you are in breach of contract and your job will be stopped until the payments are received." " (Par 55 of Exhibit AH) 
I have no doubt that at the time of executing the contract with Venture the requirements arising out of the engineer's plans were well known to Kioussis and that there was nothing to prevent the cost of performing the works in accordance with those plans being estimated for inclusion in the contract price.

I think the involvement of P Kioussis in this contract administration to this exploitation exposes her as a knowing and willing party to Venture's exploitation of the Corbetts. Her refusal to provide supporting invoices, her threat of stoppages if her demands were not satisfied, the illegitimate nature of the Venture claims, in my opinion stamp her with knowing involvement in
Venture's conduct.

After this unsatisfactory exchange with the Venture group, Corbett took the matter up with Collings at a meeting on 18 December 1990. His evidence, which
I accept, was as follows: "Straight after the conversation with Penny, on the same day, I went to see
Wayne.

I said "Look at the cost they're trying to hit me for extra concrete." 
Wayne said, "Look the matter's out of my hands, if they've given you a bill you'll just have to pay it." 
I was very angry and I said, "We bloody trusted you and yet you didn't tell us about any extra costs for any concrete and now you're telling us it's just out of your hands and we just have to pay for it." 
Wayne said, "Yeah, that's right." " (Par 56 of Exhibit AH) 
Corbett left the meeting in anger and sought professional engineering advice.

On 20 December 1990 Corbett paid the amount of $53,850 made up of payment for the four variations to which I have referred together with a first progress payment of 15 percent of the contract price.

It was not necessary in these proceedings to trace the history of Venture's performance under its contract with the Corbetts having regard to the findings in the varied report which included the finding that it was necessary to demolish Venture's work to the slab. However, I consider that there are some aspects of Venture's performance which should be noted and which, I think, demonstrates the unscrupulousness of the Venture group in Venture's administration of this contract.

By a claim dated 27 June 1991, Venture made a variation claim for the supply of some bricks which it appears had to be supplied as a result of the demolition of Venture's defective brickwork. The following discussion took place between Corbett and P Kioussis concerning this claim: "When I received this letter I rang Penny and said, "Look, I'm not paying for it, that is the work that had to be demolished, that is the extra bricks." 
Penny said, "If you don't pay you'll have to go to arbitration. Your job will be stopped and you will be charged on a quantum merit (sic) basis." 
I said, "Take me to Court, I'm still not paying it." 
Penny hung up the telephone. Penny telephoned me back about half an hour later and said, "Dad told me to tell you to stick your money up your arse and you're a pair of bastards." 
Penny then hung up the telephone." (Par 73 of Exhibit AH) 
This claim for a variation deserves further mention as it appears from the cross-examination of Corbett that while P Kioussis "was controlling the project herself .... Kioussis came out for (the) dispute on brickwork".
Corbett then gave the following evidence: "Q. What happened about that? 
A. Well there was one wall that was actually built on the dirt and not on a slab and there were other problems with the brickwork concerning the joints and everything and we were told that Harry was the expert and he came up and inspected it and told them to pull it down.

Q. And they pulled it down? 
A. Yes they did.

Q. And they rebuilt it? 
A. Yes they did.

Q. Were you happy with the new work that was done? 
A. No. It got pulled down again.

Q. Did it get rebuilt again? 
A. Yes it did.

Q. Were you happy with that? 
A. Oh the next lot seemed all right. They got another lot of bricklayers." (T515.35 - .56) 
Notwithstanding that history when Corbett withheld payment of this claimed variation it drew the following response of Venture in its letter to the
Corbetts of 1 August 1991: "We have carried out demolition of brick walls, which has cost the company over $7,000.00 being for materials and labour because you did not like some joints. We have photographs of the demolished brickwork which according to the
MBA, the Institute of Building and the Building Services Corporation, is a fair and reasonable laying method.

Also it has been brought to my notice that you have actually damaged brickwork, prior to us demolishing the walls.

If we have to go to Arbitration or litigation, all this will be proven and the cost of this will be borne by yourselves including payment for already laid brickwork and demolished brickwork on a quantum merit (sic) basis.

Please assist in finalising this outstanding account. The above comments have been advised by my Solicitor." (Annexure PJC 30 to Exhibit AH) 
I regard the threat of litigation as part of a pattern of conduct by Venture designed to force payment of unjustified variation demands.

In August Venture submitted a further variation claim of $2,130 for the supply and installation of a special front entry door. It had been agreed with
Collings Construction that this item would be supplied and installed as part of the contract sum and not as a variation. In Venture's work additionals this had been changed to omit the reference to "N/C" which had appeared on the
Collings Construction document. The Corbetts were unaware of this change.
However, there is little doubt that P Kioussis was well aware of it as appears from the following discussion that took place between her and Corbett upon receipt of this variation claim: "When I received this variation Advice Number 10 I telephoned Penny and said, "You've charged me for these front doors, which was supposed to be no charge." 
Penny said, "You'd better read the new tender you signed because in that it doesn't say there is to be no charge for those doors, therefore you'd better pay for them." 
I said, "Collings had them all through the initial stages when I was discussing with him as there being no charge for these doors and your father, when I sat down with him to sign the contracts, said that all the no charge items included by Collings were now in the contract." 
Penny said, "You'd better have a look at the tender letter that you've signed with us because it's not in there as no charge, therefore you'd better pay for it." " (Par 77 of Exhibit AH) 
I think it should be inferred from this evidence that Kioussis and, probably,
P Kioussis were aware at the time of the Venture contract with the Corbetts of these changes and that those changes were an act of deception on the part of
Venture.

A further variation claim was made in August 1991 in the sum of $3,160 for the supply of two bay windows to the dining and study rooms. This had been treated as a variation in both the Collings Construction work additionals and that submitted by Venture, with the difference that Venture, as I have earlier noted, inserted the word "each" before the sum stipulated so as to double the variation amount. I think it is quite clear that this was a deliberate deception on the part of Venture and one in which Kioussis and P Kioussis knowingly participated. The following evidence of Corbett emphasises the role of P Kioussis in this deception: "Shortly after I received this I telephoned Penny and said, "You've given me a bill for two bay windows at $3,160.00. The price for the windows wasn't each, the $1,580.00 was for both of them, which I've already paid as part of the work additionals." 
Penny said, "I agree, it shouldn't be $3,160.00, however if you have a look at the tender it says that the two bay windows to the dining and study are each $1,580.00 and you've only paid $1,580.00 for one window thus far." 
I said, "But Wayne Collings, in his discussions with me and in his contract, said that the $1,580.00 was for the two bay windows." 
Penny said, "Well, now you've signed the contract with us and for this one it's $1,580.00 each, therefore you owe us another $1,580.00." " (Par 79 of Exhibit AH) 
A similar doubling of the variation was made by Venture in relation to the billiard room windows and this matter was also taken up in this discussion between Corbett and P Kioussis in the following terms: " "I've also received a variation advice for the two windows to the billiard room which you have charged me $1,160.00." 
Penny said, "That's again the same thing. If you look at the tender and the work additionals you'll see that the two windows to the billiard room are each $580.00, therefore even though you've paid $580.00 for work additionals, you still owe another $580.00." " (Par 79 of Exhibit AH) 
I infer from this evidence that Venture's conduct in relation to the contractual provision for those items was deliberately deceptive and that both
Kioussis and P Kioussis were knowing and willing parties to the deception and its implementation.

In the following month the Corbetts received a series of variation claims in respect of a number of PC items. For the most part each of these items was described in the marketing guide as being included in the advertised price.
When Corbett raised this matter with P Kioussis, her connivance in the manipulation of the contract documents by Venture was evidenced in the following way: "On or about 11 September 1991 I telephoned Penny and said, "I've received Variation Advice Numbers 23 to 29 inclusive. I can accept variation number 23 as we requested a larger hot water unit than that that was described in the Collings marketing guide, however all the other items in those variation advices are included in the basic price as indicated in the
Collings marketing guide." 
Penny said, "You'd better have a look through your "Annexure A" because if you look in there you'll see that all these are PC items." " (Par 92 of Exhibit AH) 
At the meeting between the Corbetts, Richards and Kioussis of 26 October 1990,
Kioussis had assured the Corbetts that under the work additionals there would not be an area loading. However, in December 1991 Venture made a claim for area loading in the sum of $8,430. That claim was dealt with by P Kioussis in the following way: "When I received Variation Advice Number 35 I telephoned Penny and said, "I've received a copy of the bill for the area loading, but when I was signing the contracts with your father he told me that the area loading wouldn't come into it." (see paragraph 46 above) 
Penny said, "I'll just go and have a word to him and I'll get straight back to you." 
Penny came back to the telephone and said, "I've spoken to dad, and he says if you pay up now we'll give you a bit of a discount and make the amount $7,580.00." " (Par 98 of Exhibit AH) 
It is difficult to fully appreciate just what the Venture group put the
Corbetts through during this attempt at construction of their residence. The work covered a period of approximately twelve months during the course of which the Corbetts paid Venture the sum of $239,719.18. Given the history of the project, it is a matter of considerable surprise that the Corbetts continued to honour what they perceived to be their contractual obligations.
To some extent that aspect of their conduct was reflected in their evidence.
They gave their evidence courteously and without any note of bitterness which, in my opinion, they were entitled to harbour, given their treatment by
Collings Construction and by Venture. I considered that they gave their evidence frankly and I have no reason to doubt the reliability of their evidence. In particular, Corbett was convincing in rejecting suggestions in cross-examination by Collings that the provisional elements of the contractual arrangements had been fully explained to them by Collings. I have no doubt that the Corbetts entered into their contractual arrangements in the belief that they had a firm contract price for which their intended residence could be constructed and ignorant of the illusory nature of that price as a fixed price.

In any claim which includes one for aggravated damages or damages for vexation it may be sufficient to observe that, after twelve months of what could only be described as a disturbing contractual experience, the work of Venture, apart from the slab, had to be demolished by reason of its defective nature.

The Corbetts moved into the residence in December 1991 and noticed that the roof and walls were cracking, eaves were sagging, brickwork was cracked, ceilings sagged, roof tiles were cracked and the garage was of such a size that it could not accommodate normal parking of what is described as the family sized car. Those references to the evidence are not intended as an exhaustive description of the experience of the Corbetts' defects in their home. To a large extent that evidence has been excluded from these proceedings by reason of the admissions made by Venture and the findings of the varied report. The fact that the building had been demolished to slab, however, speaks for itself. Nevertheless, that demolition only took place after the
Venture group had been given more than ample time to attempt some rectification. It is obvious that any rectification that they did attempt was both dilatory and ineffective.

Corbett described the way in which he brought this matter of defective work to the attention of P Kioussis in the following extract of his evidence in chief: "112. After moving into the house we started to experience problems, such as the roof and walls cracking in the billiard room and the rumpus room, all the eaves around the house were sagging, there was still paint splashed on the brickwork, the brickwork in the garage was cracked. Over the main bedroom and rumpus room and billiard room the roof was sagging. I telephoned Penny
Kioussis in or about February 1992 and said words to the following effect:- "There are a few problems (I then described the problems referred to above in this paragraph). Could you please come out so I can go through them with you." 
She said, "I'll get there as soon as I can."
Penny Kioussis did not come out and in February 1992 I made other requests for her to come out, her response was usually words to the following effect:- "I do not have the time." " (Pars 112 and 113 of Exhibit AH) 
Following these difficulties with P Kioussis, Corbett retained legal and technical expert advice and for several months in 1992 endeavoured to rectify the problems with the building before a decision was made to demolish. I think a measure of the attitude of the Venture group to rectification can be further illustrated by the exchanges that occurred in telephone conversations between
Corbett and P Kioussis. On 15 June 1992 there was discussed the demolition of a defective wall. The attitude of P Kioussis was that Venture would not be responsible for damage caused by that rectification work. In a telephone conversation between P Kioussis and Corbett of 13 July 1992 the following offer was made by P Kioussis on behalf of Venture in relation to outstanding defective work (this in a building that was ultimately demolished): "Harry and I have gone through the rectification order, and we think the work is worth about $5,000 and we offer you $5,000 for the work if you withdraw the complaint to the BSC" 
The `rectification order' presumably referred to work required by the
Corporation.

The disruption to the harmony of the Corbett's home created by the conduct of
P Kioussis is reflected in the following evidence of Corbett:
On or about 15 July 1992 two carpenters arrived at my house at about :00 am and Penny Kioussis arrived between 9.30 am and 10.00 am. When Penny
Kioussis arrived the carpenters were on the roof carrying out some work on the tiles. I observed that one of the carpenters came down from the roof and had a conversation with Penny Kioussis. Penny Kioussis and this carpenter then went around to the front of the house and I went around to meet them. Alison at this time was on the ground floor verandah. Penny Kioussis was about 10 yards from Alison. A conversation took place in words to the following effect:- 
Penny Kioussis said to Alison, "You are interfering with the Rectification Order, we are going to get some more time." 
Alison said, "How are we interfering with the bloody Rectification Order, we haven't done anything?" 
Penny Kioussis said, "Peter has been interfering with the trades and hassling the trades." 
I said, "How can I interfere with the trades, all you've had is the carpenter on site and all I've done is stand back and look?" 
I then said to the carpenter that was with Penny Kioussis, "Have I been interfering with you, like coming up and leaning over your shoulder?" 
The carpenter said, "No." 
Penny Kioussis then began to yell at Alison and myself, I can't recall what she yelled. Alison appeared to be getting very upset and she was getting flushed and appeared to be becoming very tense. I was very concerned about this because at this time Alison was eight months pregnant. I said to Penny
Kioussis, "Back off, or I'll punch you in the nose." 
Penny Kioussis then came very close to me and said, "Come on do it, hit me, go on hit me, go on, do it." 
I said, "You're not bloody worth it, I wouldn't waste my time." 
I then turned to walk away and as I was walking away Penny Kioussis said, "Well that's it, you've breached the Rectification Order, no more work will be done." 
I then went inside my house with Alison.
Penny Kioussis and the two carpenters remained at the house and carried out work on some gutters to the front of the house for about another hour or so. From time to time Penny Kioussis would look through the window and laugh at myself and Alison....." (Pars 139 and 140 of Exhibit AH)

 (Annexure PJC 73 to Exhibit AH) 
The final payment was made some time after 18 December 1991. I have added to the above extract the date of each respective claim of variation which appears in brackets following the description of the variation.

Between February and March 1993 the Corbetts, with the assistance of family members, demolished the building as constructed by Venture and, again with the assistance of family members, re-erected a prefabricated steel frame building using the slab which had been laid by Venture, extended to accommodate the change in design of the new building from that constructed by Venture.

The decision to re-erect a residence on their land as owner-builders was dictated to the Corbetts by their lack of financial resources.

The Commission has addressed on alternative bases the quantification of the
Corbett's damages said to have been occasioned by the conduct of the respondents. This arises, in large measure, out of the fact that the Corbetts have acted as owner builders in the re-erection of the residence on their property and in doing so have departed from the plans the subject of the
Venture contract. Moreover, the report quantified costs of erection as follows: "(a) This house was demolished to the slab and rebuilt by the Proprietor himself. However tenders were obtained for demolition and re-building from 3 builders, who provided the following quotations: Cotton: $358,700; Profilio: $348,000 and Jones: $362,465. These figures are much greater than the reasonable price to build found in response to Question 3.1, $209,644.

In the circumstances I consider it reasonable to adopt the cost of $25,000 given by Mr. Daley, and apply it to the adjusted 3.1 finding, i.e. $204,750 amended to reinstate the discounted Builder's Profit to 10%. The result is $243,561 ($25,000 + $218,561)." (Referee's Report <case>.2.4) 
By the varied report this sum of $243,561 was adjusted by deducting the sum of $30,161 representing the value of the slab and site works performed by
Venture, the benefit of which was retained by the Corbetts. This resulted in an assessment for demolition and rebuilding of $213,400.

The difference in formulation of the Corbett's claim consisted of the first claim being based upon the reasonable costs of demolition and rectification and rebuilding as found in the varied report, whereas the alternative basis consisted of a substitution for those costs of the actual costs of performing that work. The actual costs were greater than the costs as allowed in the varied report. This alternative was advanced during the course of these proceedings by the Commission to meet any possible substance in the contention of counsel on behalf of Venture that the proper measure of damage, if such a head of claim was to be allowed, was the amount of the actual costs of rectification and not some reasonable estimate of costs such as that found in the varied report. Reference was made by counsel in support of this proposition to Ruxley Electronics & Construction Ltd -v- Forsyth (1995) All ER 268. I do not think Ruxley is any authority for that proposition.
Ruxley was concerned with the unreasonableness of a quantification of a claim for damages for defective work based upon the costs of rectification where (a) the defect had no prejudicial effect on the efficiency of the finished works, (b) it was not intended to carry out any such rectification work and (c) it was considered unreasonable to require such rectification work to be performed.

In my opinion, quite clearly, where one is called upon to address as a head of damage the cost of rectification involving demolition, rectification and rebuilding of works, it is a legitimate exercise to examine actual costs in the context of their reasonableness. That is the exercise performed by the referee as expressed in the sections above quoted from the report. I have no doubt that the proper basis of assessment of damages should include such costs of demolition, rectification and rebuilding on the basis of the reasonable costs as so found and not the actual costs incurred by the Corbetts. As a matter of interest, the actual costs were some $120,000 greater than the costs assessed on the varied report as is shown in the schedules which follow: 
Given the extent to which the various components of the owners' loss or damage have been put in issue, there is no alternative other than to set out each of the items of assessment and address the matters of contention raised by the parties in relation to each such item.

The Quaglias 
It is likely that the Quaglias were saved from a similar experience to that suffered by the other owners by the unexpected and unfortunate loss of employment suffered by Quaglia during the course of his dealings with the respondents. The evidence disclosed that the Quaglias were restricted to a budget limit of $100,000 which was available to them by way of loan from the
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, arranged at a time when Quaglia was in employment. The Quaglias received a quotation from Collings Construction of $109,487 which was made up of a building cost of $97,487 and the "copyright fee" of $12,000. The building cost, described as a "Contract Price", was itself made up of a "Basic Price" of $92,187, plus adjustments for specified provisional sums, which brought the price to $97,487. This price was reduced by the sum of $9,587, made up of various credits for items to be provided by the Quaglias, certain other deletions and a builder's discount. The varied report found that the reasonable building cost for the subject works was between $129,650 and $131,770 depending on the standard of finish. Clearly had the Qauglias proceeded with construction under the contract structure inherent in the Collings Construction quotation, the financial outcome would have been disastrous for the Quaglias.

I think the evidence concerning the Quaglias' dealings with the Collings group and the Venture group demonstrates the unscrupulous conduct of the Venture group and the cynicism of Collings Construction in its negotiation with the owners. Given the Collings group's experience of Venture's conduct in relation to the Corbetts' contract, I think the evidence concerning the Quaglias confirms the fact that Collings Construction and Collings were aware of the capacity of Venture to exploit the contractual structure established by
Collings Construction in its dealings with the owners.

In mid 1990 the Quaglias lived in their own premises at Ermington (the
Ermington property) which they considered too small for their needs.
Accordingly, the decision was taken to place the Ermington property on the market. Completion of sale took place at the end of September 1990. Shortly prior to settlement the Quaglias moved into a home at Gladesville (the
Gladesville property) which was owned by Quaglia's father. At about that time, the Quaglias made enquiries of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and ascertained that they could borrow approximately $100,000 for the purpose of constructing a home. It is the evidence of Quaglia that the proceeds of the sale of the Ermington property were used in purchasing a vacant block of land at Cherrybrook (the Cherrybrook property) and that they could not afford to build a home on the Cherrybrook property costing more than $100,000.

On 29 September 1990 the Quaglias visited the houses on display at Home World where they noticed Collings Construction's buildings and its sales office which was distinguished by a notice board in the name of Collings Homes. At the office of Collings Construction the Quaglias obtained a brochure which had the caption "Collings Homes ....... YOUR PERSONAL BUILDER". The brochure set out a variety of designs which were identified under various names and model numbers. There was nothing in the brochure which would lead its reader to conclude that Collings Homes was other than the builder of the homes shown in the brochure. It was described as the builder and contained the statement "35
YEARS IN BUILDING". It contained the statement that Collings Homes used and recommended a variety of PC items and fixtures including "S. T. C. FRAMES & TRUSSES". The tenor of this sales material was reflected in the market guide which was also supplied to the Quaglias by Collings Construction. The market guide described Collings Homes as a builder and as a "family based company that has been in operation for thirty years". It listed prices for the various homes on offer. There was no attempt to separate a design fee from construction costs in the price list. The building which attracted the interest of the Quaglias was the design described as the "Louisiana EC17H" which had a listed price of $104,187.

A week later the Quaglias revisited the Collings Construction office and there entered into discussions with Richards. The Quaglias made known to Richards the budget limit of $100,000 and discussed modifications of the Louisiana design and the performance of work, such as painting, by the Quaglias.
Arrangements were made for Richards to inspect the Cherrybrook property. After a few days Quaglia was contacted by Richards who appointed a meeting with them at the office of Collings Construction on 9 October 1990. At that meeting
Richards showed the Quaglias a break up of a "Contract Price" of $97,487 (which was subject to certain credits) and $12,000 for "Collings Homes
Copyright". Discussion centred around a reduction of price by way of a "builder's discount to be negotiated", the selection of a builder and further modifications to the fittings of the proposed building. Richards confirmed that he had inspected the site and that it presented no problems. It was left for Richards to submit a written quotation by Collings Construction. At about this time the Quaglias obtained a copy of the Spring 1990 edition of the PHB guide in which Collings Homes described itself as being "30 YEARS IN BUILDING" and the holder of a builder's licence under the BSC Act.

On about 15 October 1990 the Quaglias received by facsimile of that date a quotation in form identical with the quotation received by the Corbetts from
Collings Construction. In the Quaglia's quotation the costs of $109,487 was made up of the builder's work in the sum of $97,487 and the copyright fee $12,000. Collings Construction submitted a summary to the Quaglias which showed how the sum of $97,487, described as Contract Price, was made up. It had a basic price of $92,187, purporting to be calculated on a provisional cost of bricks and subject to clearing by the Quaglias and access being to the "builder's satisfaction". There followed fourteen provisional sum items, identical in description with the provisional sum items listed in the
Corbetts' summary and, like the Corbetts' summary, the majority of the provisional sum items had no sum allocated to them. Where sums were allocated, those sums when added to the basic price to produce the contract price.

The Quaglias also received a work additionals document which, in their case, consisted of a number of credits and one "no charge" item.

These documents were the subject of discussion between the Quaglias, Collings and Richards at the Collings Construction office on 20 October 1990 when they were introduced by Richards to Collings. The Quaglias required some further changes to the design. The changes involved some credits as well as variations by way of extra. Some involved no charge. After discussing these matters, agreement was reached and a deposit of $2,000 was requested by Collings.
Quaglia did not have this amount of money available and it was agreed that a cheque for $1,000 be paid to Collings Constructions in lieu of the requested deposit of $2,000. At Quaglia's request, Richards provided Quaglia with a plan of the Louisiana. The plan so provided was to a scale of 1-100 and consisted of a floor plan and elevations with a drawing of a section running through the centre of the building. There was no site plan nor were levels incorporated.
The drawing was depicted as though the building was sitting on a perfectly level block. If Richards had visited the Cherrybrook property as he had stated to the Quaglias, it would have been known that the footings as shown on the plan would have been quite inadequate with significant cutting and filling of the site being required to accommodate the building. It is significant that a comparatively modest sum of $900 was allowed for excavation and site preparation in the summary, whereas the item of footings though described as provisional, had no sum allocated to it. It must have been obvious to Collings
Construction, that the so called contract price was inadequate and that, if it was adjusted to accommodate the required site preparation and excavation and the provision of adequate footings it would increase the contract price above the Quaglias' budget. I accept the evidence of the Quaglias and reject the evidence of Collings that this likely additional cost was brought to the
Quaglias' attention prior to reaching agreement with them. In cross- examination of Quaglia by Collings I think Quaglia gave evidence convincingly that the first time extra cost was raised was some months later after Quaglia had cause to complain about Venture's conduct in relation to this item and other matters.

Arrangements were made at the meeting of 20 October 1990 for the Quaglias to confer with the Collings Construction draftsman, Ian Inglis (Inglis), presumably, to finalise plan details for submission to council. The council building approval was anticipated to require up to eight weeks.

There followed a meeting between the Quaglias and Inglis on 11 November 1990 at which the details as had previously been discussed between the Quaglias,
Richards and Collings were confirmed. The Quaglias produced their own drawing showing the changes that had been so discussed. Time was taken at the meeting to locate the proposed dwelling on the site. For this purpose a transparency was used and Inglis was apparently in possession of a site plan showing boundaries and the like.

After this meeting Quaglia received a call from Richards to inform him that the plan had been completed by Inglis and a meeting was arranged with Quaglia at the Collings Construction office for 20 November 1990. At this meeting
Richards had a copy of the Inglis plan on which some mistakes were noted by
Quaglia. At the request of Richards, Quaglia signed the transparency plan stipulating that he was signing it subject to the changes required to correct the mistakes that he had noted. Richards undertook to have the plans submitted to council that week. Inglis' plan, in substance, reproduced the Louisiana plan previously provided to the Quaglias but with some significant differences. In particular it contained a site plan showing levels and boundaries with the location of the proposed residence superimposed on it. The elevations made it clear that significant site works were required to accommodate the levels shown. Inevitably those site works would have a bearing on the requisite footings. At this meeting Richards supplied Quaglia with a further schedule of work additionals which was in the following form: "Painting and cleaning by Owner Credit 3,200. 00 
Supply and fix ceramic tiles by Owner Credit 2,100. 00 
Delete robes to all bedrooms except bedroom [1 Cr. 1],480. 00 
Rough in plumbing and drainage to ensuite N/C 
Wall to divide billiard room 300. 00 
Credit for W. C. Vanity and Shower to ensuite Cr. 1,014. 00 ~~Widen side of bedroom 1 under eaves~~ ~~720. 00~~ 
Move wall laundry to bathroom by approximately mm as per amended plan N/C 
Sunken lounge one (1) step N/C 
Redesign ensuite as per plan N/C 
Builders discount $2,287. 00" (Exhibit AN, annexure FQ14) 
Over the next two months there was little contact between the Quaglias and
Collings Construction. In mid January the Quaglias visited the Collings
Construction office and arranged through Richards to commence the selection of bricks from suppliers known as Boral Bricks or Bathurst Bricks. Richards also referred them to an organisation known as Exclusive Kitchens for the selection of kitchen fittings. In the latter weeks of January the Quaglias made their selection of bricks and, on enquiry of Richards, were informed that the plans were still with council. In February the Quaglias entered into negotiations with Exclusive Kitchens for the supply of various kitchen fittings. In the course of these negotiations they were provided with a quotation from
Exclusive Kitchens who requested a deposit of $500 if the quotation was acceptable.

Shortly after this meeting Quaglia contacted Richards and informed him of the
Quaglias' meeting with the representative of Exclusive Kitchens and sought confirmation that a "cook top and range hood" were included in the price. The response of Richards was: "Its only included if its on the plan. Check the marketing guide. It'll be on there." 
In relation to council approval of the plans, Richards informed Quaglia that they were still with the council. In this conversation Richards obtained the agreement of Quaglia to pay the further $1,000 deposit which had been previously requested of the Quaglias.

Following up this conversation Quaglias referred to the marketing guide to ascertain whether the range hood was in fact included in the price. He concluded that it was. His reason for doing so is not particularly difficult to extract from the marketing guide. On the back sheet of the marketing guide there is the heading: "COLLINGS MARKETING GUIDE 
WHAT'S INCLUDED IN OUR ADVERTISED DELUXE PRICE" 
Below this heading were two columns of items purporting to particularise those items that were so included. Below the two columns was a further heading, namely: "Custom Features Displayed &/Or Available Not Included in Deluxe Price" 
Under this last heading there appeared items such as a dishwasher, a microwave and a cupboard unit. A range hood is not mentioned. It is mentioned in the items listed under the heading of what is included in the so called deluxe price. It appears as item three in the following form: "3. Quality top-of-the-range recirculating range hood with filter and light included. * INCLUDED." 
All of the items on the right hand side of this part of the guide schedule followed a similar format with the word "Included" stamped in bold print adjacent to each of the eleven items described as included. There is one difference. Items two through to eleven inclusive each are distinguished by a small asterisk. There is no such distinguishing mark in relation to item one.
On the very last line of the page in an inconspicuous location appears the following: "* Items only when indicated on plan are included" 
I regard that description of items said to be included in the deluxe price offered by Collings Construction as being quite deceptive and it is not in the least bit surprising that Quaglia came to the understanding that this item was, indeed, included in the price quoted to him. In my opinion, it is little short of an elaborate farce to purport to identify in two separate portions of the guide a section for items stated to be included in the offered price with the other section identifying items not so included and to have in the former section a statement of items said to be included which in fact were not and in which the attention of the reader to this misleading structure of the guide is buried in the form of a small asterisk and a correspondingly small statement at the foot of the guide.

In response to Quaglias' request of Richards for a copy of the proposed building contract, a copy of the BC3 contract together with a document entitled "SPECIAL CONDITIONS" was provided to Quaglia. The special conditions in printed form were identical with those forming part of the Corbett contract. They were in standard form and appear to have taken no account of any requirements specific to the Quaglias' site . On 17 February 1991 Quaglia made an unscheduled visit to the office of Collings Construction to pay the balance of the $2,000 deposit requested previously by Richards. The receipt he was given was on the letterhead of Collings Construction which was described as "MASTER BUILDERS & CONTRACTORS".

Richards also provided two further plans to Quaglia which he identified as an architectural plan and a slab and footings plan. The architectural plan was similar to that which had been provided to Quaglia on 20 November 1990 but with differences in the elevations shown. They also depicted works not previously shown. The slab and footings details were new and showed an extensive network of footings and some piers. As earlier stated the necessity for such footings must have been known to Collings Construction by reason of the site visit of Richards and from the previous experience of Collings in relation to sites requiring cut and fill. In cross-examination Collings agreed that he was aware of the need for the provision of pier footings in such circumstances.

As it happened the plans as submitted to council were unacceptable to the council having regard to the extent of cut and fill planned. As at the last week of February 1991 no progress had been made in obtaining council's approval. Council had referred the plans back to Collings Construction. In discussion between Quaglia and Inglis on 22 February 1991 it was suggested to
Inglis that an answer to council's objection might lie in dropping the level of portion of the building to enable the remainder of the building works to be constructed at a higher level than that shown on the plans submitted to council.

On 25 February 1991 the Quaglias received formal approval of mortgage finance in the sum of $100,000. On 18 March 1991 Quaglia received a telephone call from J Collings demanding payment of the balance of the copyright fee. She appears to have accepted Quaglia's explanation that finance for the project was by way of borrowed funds and the monies would not be available until the bank had sighted approved plans. On 25 March 1991 Quaglia had a telephone conversation with Richards in which the latter informed Quaglia that council approved plans were ready. On 26 March 1991 a copy of the approved plan, the conditions of approval and a copy of the specifications were uplifted by
Quaglia. The plan noted the alterations to levels and identified the footings as consisting of a concrete slab and edge beams to engineer's details. Armed with the approved plans Quaglia was able to complete formal arrangements for the required loan from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. From those funds on April 1991, Quaglia paid Collings Construction the further fee of $10,572.
On this occasion Richards produced a copyright agreement, which after a discussion with Quaglia involving some alterations to it, Quaglia signed.

On 6 April 1991 Quaglia paid Exclusive Kitchens the required deposit but first confirmed with Richards that the deposit should be paid directly to Exclusive
Kitchens rather than to Collings Construction. During the course of this conversation with Richards Quaglia requested "a price on the extra brickwork because of the dropping of the garage and changing levels". He also discussed another, comparatively minor, variation. I think it is quite clear from this evidence that Quaglia well understood that the alteration in levels involving additional brickwork would or could have some significant bearing on the cost of the works. He was cross-examined upon this by Collings and I found his answers on this subject unsatisfactory. I think it is reasonably clear that
Quaglia understood that there was an additional cost involved and he was eventually forced to acknowledge this. However, he took the stand that any extra cost would have to be absorbed by Collings Construction. He sought to justify this on the basis that he had stipulated to Collings Construction that he had a strict budget limit and that whatever was supplied by Collings
Construction had to be constructed within that cost. My view is that, if that was the approach by Quaglia, it was incumbent upon him to settle that matter at the time.

In accordance with the arrangement made with Richards the Quaglias paid a deposit to Exclusive Kitchens on 6 April 1991. On 8 April 1991, Richards in a telephone conversation with Quaglia requested a meeting between the Quaglias and "the builder". This took place on 9 April 1991 at the office of Collings
Construction. Kioussis attended this meeting and was introduced by Richards as "your builder, Harry Kioussis of Venture Industries". Kioussis presented a business card which described him as managing director and having qualifications "B. B. Q. S. (NSW Uni) NAID". At this meeting formal matters were discussed, such as the source of the Quaglia's finance, and Richards produced a contract document. Quaglia recognised its front sheet to be the same as the BC3 contract previously supplied to him by Richards. Stapled to it was a sheet entitled "SPECIAL CONDITIONS ...." in the same form as the documents so entitled which Richards had supplied with the BC3 contract.
Quaglia enquired why he was required to sign this document to which Richards replied: "Oh, this is for our records .... for the work we have done so far. I'd like you to sign it.".

Quaglia objected to signing it on the basis that he had been advised that certain conditions in the special conditions were unacceptable. In response to this Richards simply removed the special conditions from the document and again assured the Quaglias that their signature was only required "for our records, for the work we have done so far". In response to a request for a copy of the document, Richards provided Quaglia with a front sheet of a BC3 contract and its two pages containing the articles of agreement. The articles of agreement identified the Quaglias as the proprietor and Venture as the builder, the subject works were identified "as Per Tender letter dated 15th
Oct 90". The contract price was stated to be $96,915. Given the evidence of negotiations which to that point had taken place between Richards and the
Quaglias it is not entirely clear to me how that figure of $96,915 was arrived at. I do not regard that as a matter of any particular significance. At this meeting there was the first of a number of confrontations that the Quaglias had with Kioussis over the contractual arrangements put in train by Collings
Construction. Quaglia informed Kioussis that he had paid the deposit on kitchen fittings to Exclusive Kitchens. Kioussis strongly objected to this, demanding that the Quaglias obtain a refund of the deposit as Kioussis insisted on using his own trades people for this work. The Quaglias left the meeting without that matter being resolved. Arrangements were made for the
Quaglias to meet Kioussis again at the premises of Venture on 15 April 1991.
Between the two meetings, the Quaglias confirmed with the Corporation that
Venture was licensed as a builder under the BSC Act. At the meeting of 15
April, Kioussis produced a number of documents for the Quaglias to "look at".
At the outset of this meeting, Quaglias informed Kioussis that they were "on a strict budget" and sought to find out what extra cost would be involved in the brickwork associated with change in the levels of the building. The Quaglias gained no satisfaction from Kioussis as the following evidence of Quaglias disclosed: "I said: "Can you tell me how much for extra brickwork?" 
He said: "Well, I won't be able to do that until we get to the site." 
I said: "Look, we are on a strict budget. We need to know the costs. We can't go into it without knowing what it will cost." 
He said: "No, no, I can't do that until we get to the site." " (Exhibit AN, p 69) 
Among the documents presented to the Quaglias was a letter dated 15 April 1991 on the letterhead of Venture and signed by Kioussis and which was in the following terms: "We hereby introduce ourselves, being a independent franchise builder for
Collings Homes and in which we will be carrying out the construction of the
Collings design home prepared for yourselves, with excellence and in a true craftsman like manner.

Our Company has been established since 1979 with many records of achievements and specialise in giving our clients complete service.

Please find attached a summary of our quotation.

The amount specified on the quotation is subject to the position of the building on the proposed block of land and associated levels being confirmed by a surveyor, and to a standard engineer's architectural specification being the details used.

The drainage system and plans have been approved by council and water board.

Our contract agreement is subject to a BC3 contract, which has been prepared and approved by the Master Builders Association, which we are members of the
Master Builders Association and the Australian Institute of Building.

We trust that the above meets with your approval, however, should any queries arise please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned." (Exhibit AN, Annexure FQ36) 
There was also included in the documents a BC3 contract which identified the drawings as drawing number 6A to which the proposed works were to be constructed. The contract price was stated to be $96,915 "Plus variations".
The form of contract was accompanied by a three page set of special conditions which, apart from some insignificant differences, corresponded with the special conditions forming part of the Corbetts' contract. As in the case of the Corbetts' contract Venture also incorporated the plain english document.
However, the provision for the payment of a deposit was limited to 5 per cent: no doubt in recognition of the limit imposed by the BSC Act upon the receipt of deposits. However, Kioussis maintained the provision for the payment of "Work Additionals" within seven days of signing the contract. This had little bearing as the work additionals represented a credit.

Given the details of the engineer's footing plan which were known to Collings
Construction and, presumably, to Venture at the time of this meeting, the inclusion in the plain english document of the following provision made a mockery of the concept of a fixed contract price: "Standard home allowance for concreting is as follows: 
For footings, 300mm x 250mm 
For slab, 100mm thick with one layer of steel 
No piers have been allowed" 
In my opinion, the inclusion of such a provision in the knowledge that extra footings were required for the Quaglias' home and in the knowledge of the importance of the budget limit to the Quaglias, demonstrated a complete cynicism on the part of Venture towards the legitimate interests and expectations of the Quaglias. In the light of subsequent events it is reasonably clear that the undated drawing number 6A referred to in the BC3 form of contract was the original basic plan without any site plan and showing no engineering details other than reinforced concrete slab. Again, in my opinion, the conduct of Kioussis in endeavouring to obtain the agreement of the Quaglias to the documents presented to them at this meeting may only be regarded as a completely dishonest attempt to obtain their agreement to the performance of works the content of which had been overtaken by substantial changes.

When confronted with these documents Quaglia attempted to gain some clarification from Kioussis particularly as to the likelihood of extras if the plain english document became part of the contract. Quaglia raised questions concerning extra brickwork, site excavation, piers, the provision of concrete, the builder's 25 per cent mark up on deletions and the provision for rise and fall to be "paid in accordance to the builders cost". In keeping with the general dishonest behaviour of Kioussis, all of his answers to these enquiries were evasive, and for the most part, false and misleading, referring to these provisions as standard clauses and as being "all explained in plain English".
He refused to provide any estimate of an additional cost of brickwork on the basis that this estimate could not be provided until site work began. That was plainly false. Although there had been agreement reached with Collings
Construction concerning deletion of finishes in the main bathroom, laundry and kitchen, Kioussis refused to abide by that arrangement. In relation to the credits which had been agreed between the Quaglias and Collings Construction,
Qauglia gave the following evidence of his conversation with Kioussis: "I said: "George (Richards) said that we could do the tiling ourselves and that it would not be a problem." 
He said: "We can't give you all that credit for the vanity, shower and toilet.
That's what the builders discount is for." 
I said: "Those things were worked out with George. They are separate. Because the ensuite isn't going to be finished you won't have to supply those things." 
He said: "I quoted the price to George on the tender letter he faxed to me on October 1990. Anything, any changes you wanted, after that is a variation.
The ensuite will have to be roughed in at the owners cost." (I observed him write on a piece of paper in front of him.) 
I said: "Look, the plumbing for the ensuite is already in the contract. All we're saying is don't put a tap on the end of it. You're charging us to leave it out. Even the tender letter says no charge." 
He said: "This N/C on the tender letter means no cost, not no charge. It just hadn't been costed yet." 
I said: "That's not right. We talked to George about all of this and it was clearly no charge. You're doing less work, not more." 
He said: "It's not normal building practice." (Exhibit AN, part of par 89, pp 80-81) 
Those responses of Kioussis were dishonest The only bright spot in relation to this meeting is in the fact that Quaglia was not persuaded to sign the contract documents. Instead, he requested a copy of them for further consideration.

The Quaglias took some legal advice in the matter and on 17 April 1991 wrote to Collings Construction with a copy being forwarded to Kioussis. The letter referred to the meeting with Kioussis of 15 April 1991 as disclosing some "misunderstandings" and referred to the presence of a rise and fall clause in the form of contract proposed by Venture. The Quaglias stated in the letter that they were "worried that (they would) not be able to afford the finished house" and that they would need to review their finances and refer back to the lending bank. The response of Kioussis to this letter was a telephone call by him to Quaglia on 23 April 1991 in which he insisted that the Quaglias were bound by the document they signed at the meeting on 9 April 1991. He threatened Court proceedings and professed to have superior knowledge as a result of having "studied building law at University". It was not unnatural that the Quaglias were concerned by this confrontation and on 27 April 1991 went to the Collings Construction office, without prior appointment, to discuss the matter with Collings. In this discussion the Quaglias made the point that Kioussis was not prepared to respect what had been negotiated with
Collings Construction and reminded Collings of the strict budget limit of $100,000 which had always been stipulated as a maximum construction cost.
Quaglia then went through the various items which had been agreed between the
Quaglias and Collings Construction and which Venture was refusing to honour.
Collings undertook to take these matters up with Kioussis.

In order to get some detailed legal advice on their position, Quaglia made a telephone call to Kioussis on 2 May 1991 in which he requested a copy of all the documents that Kioussis required to be signed. Arrangements were made for the collection of the proposed contract later that day and to sign the necessary contract documents on 7 May 1991. In this conversation Kioussis claimed that Collings had not discussed with him Quaglias' complaint against
Venture of dishonouring the arrangement between the Quaglias and Collings
Construction. The documents which were provided to Kioussis on 2 May 1991 included a transmittal notice which accompanied the standard Collings
Construction plan 6A which was the undated plan which had been superseded as the result of substantial alteration made through the council approval stage.
Also provided were specifications, the council approval, the engineer's drawing of the footings and slab, the amended architectural drawing, the
Collings Construction quotation of 15 October 1990 and a drawing showing kitchen details. The Collings Construction quotation included the special conditions document. It is the evidence of Quaglia, which I accept, that he had not received this document with the facsimile of Collings Construction to the Quaglias of 15 October 1990. The special conditions provided for additional costs for footings and stipulated that the provisional sums stated in the quotation were "not an estimate of the cost". The foundations were specified as consisting of a standard slab and strip footing when this element had been substantially changed in the council approved plans.

Prior to the planned meeting of 7 May 1991 the Quaglias' concern with the state of their dealings with Collings Construction and Venture was such that they sought further legal advice. To add to their trials, on 6 May 1991
Quaglia was retrenched without prior notification. I think it is clear that this event convinced the Quaglias that the contractual arrangements which
Collings Construction and Venture were seeking to force upon them were beyond their financial capacity and accordingly on 7 May 1991 Quaglia instructed his solicitor to write to Venture in the following terms: "Please be advised that we are the solicitors for Mr. And Mrs. Quaglia and we understand that you had an appointment with them this morning at 11:00 a.m.
with a view to signing an Agreement as submitted by you under cover of letter of the 15 April, 1991.

Our clients do not intend proceeding with the execution of the Agreement and wish to terminate all dealings with you.

It is quite disturbing to find that an attempt was made by one of your representatives to enter into an agreement on the 9 April, 1991 which was backdated to the 15 October 1990 and in any event which clearly does not reflect the negotiations which had gone beforehand between the parties, was incomplete in material respects and our clients were induced to execute it by deceptive and misleading conduct.

In any event, we assume by virtue of your letter of the 15 April, 1991 and its enclosures that you do not regard the document of the 15 October, 1990 which is in the form of a BC3 Contract to be a contract.

Our clients do not wish to engage in any discussions or communication with you and should further correspondence become necessary you are asked to communicate directly with this firm." (Exhibit AN, Annexure FQ51) 
Notwithstanding the direction to refer any communication to the solicitor,
Kioussis communicated directly with the Quaglias by facsimile and letter of 9
May 1991 which asserted that the Quaglias were contractually bound to Venture and were in breach of that contract. Venture professed to have commenced work on the project and threatened legal proceedings and the lodgment of a caveat on the Cherrybrook property. Venture's right to take this action was challenged by the letter of Quaglias' solicitor of 14 May 1991 to Venture in which it was recorded that the Quaglias regarded the conduct of Venture as "deceptive and misleading". There was no reply received from Venture to that letter. About this time the Quaglias informed the lending bank of their inability to proceed with their loan facility. However, they commenced making repayments of the monies previously drawn on that facility. They unsuccessfully sought recovery of the deposit paid to Exclusive Kitchens.

The Quaglias did not proceed with the building approval obtained by Collings
Construction and this approval lapsed on 15 March 1992. It was the intention of the Quaglias to construct a home as owner-builders to a design of their own making. On 21 April 1992 they were advised that Venture had lodged a caveat on the Cherrybrook property. The Quaglias were forced to take legal proceedings for the removal of the caveat. The proceedings appear to have been successfully concluded at the end of August 1992. By this time the activities of the Collings group and of the Venture group were the subject of media publicity and the Quaglias joined a group which was formed to assist its members in combating the conduct of Collings Construction and Venture. This group, was known as the Misadventure Club and acted under the legal guidance of their solicitor, Salvatore Russo (Russo). The Quaglias claim aggravated damages or damages for vexation on the basis they have lived throughout the period of this dispute with the respondents, in the home of Quaglia's father which, as a result, was occupied by five adults and three children. It is a three bedroom home. It was claimed that the cramped living conditions and the excessive demand on amenities has led to continuous disharmony.

The varied report found that a reasonable price for the Quaglias' building was between $129,650 and $131,770 depending on the standard of finish. This may be compared with the Collings Construction "price" of $87,706. The varied report also found that the contractual arrangement structured by Collings
Construction reflected an excessive use of provisional sum items and that virtually all of those items should have been the subject of cost estimation for inclusion in a firm contract price.

In evaluating the evidence of the Quaglias it is clear that J Quaglia, as she stated on several occasions on cross-examination, bowed to the judgment and decisions of Quaglia in their dealings with the respondents. Of the evidence of Quaglia, I considered that he presented as an intelligent witness who was prompt and frank in his responses under cross-examination. I think his evidence concerning responsibility for the cost of the extra brickwork involved in the change in levels effected to meet council's requirements revealed him as a person extremely careful in financial matters.

J Quaglia also was forthright in giving her evidence. She answered questions without apparent regard to the implications of her answers. I accept the general accuracy and reliability of the Qauglias' evidence.

Despite the reference to independent franchise builders in the Collings
Construction quotation, the evidence of the Quaglias which I accept, is that they were impressed with the identification of Collings Construction as a builder in the preliminary material and in their initial communications with
Collings Construction. The reference to `independent franchise builder' was taken by them to refer to a building team under the control of Collings
Construction. In this respect I think they were reasonable in so acting. I accept their evidence that they would not have entered into any contractual arrangements with Collings Construction had they known that it was not a builder and would not be building their house: that it was charging $12,000 for a design service with no building supervisory component: had they reason to believe that Venture was untrustworthy and incompetent and that the contract price submitted by Collings Construction and Venture was a price which was subject to significant increases. I think it is beyond argument that had they known of the fraud of which Kioussis was guilty in his dealings with them and of the incompetent and disreputable nature of Venture, the Quaglias would not have had any dealings with Venture.

The Staps 
The Staps first made contact with Collings Construction in February 1990 when visiting Home World. They had purchased a property at Dural (the Dural property) in 1989 with the intention of constructing their home on it. They first became aware of the activities of Collings Construction through the PHB guides for "Summer 1989/90" and "Winter 1990". Both guides contained the misleading statements describing Collings Homes as possessing a builders licence, as being "30 YEARS IN BUILDING" and that "Collings Homes build throughout N.S.W.".

About 8 April 1990 the Staps reached agreement with Collings Construction to build a home for approximately $102,000 for which, on the understanding of the
Staps, there was a deposit of $12,000 required. On the last mentioned date the
Staps paid $2,000 and signed a formal copyright agreement which provided for the payment of $2,000 on signing and the balance on the obtaining of council building approval. Shortly after reaching this agreement the Staps, for personal reasons, decided not to proceed with the project and so informed
Richards. In the circumstances the Staps were prepared to forfeit the $2,000 which they had paid. Collings unsuccessfully tried to persuade Stap to reverse this decision. There was no further contact with Collings Construction until
February 1991, by which time the Staps had decided to proceed with a building of their own design for which they had retained architects for the architectural plans and Larkins for the structural specifications. It appears from a telephone conversation between Collings and Stap about that time that
Collings had heard of Staps' intention to develop the Dural property. The conversation as evidenced by Stap was as follows: "In about February 1991, I received a telephone call from Wayne Collings (WC).
He said 
WC: "I hear you are going to build on your block of land." 
JS: "How do you know?" 
WC: "The building world is small." 
JS: "I've got a couple of builders who are quoting on specifications and plans, I'm really not interested." 
WC: "Look Jacques just give me the opportunity to quote on the plans, I'm certain that I can get at least $4,000.00 below your lowest quote." 
JS: "How do you know that?" 
WC: "I've got a computer estimating program and I can get the cheapest prices for suppliers." 
JS: "If you can do that go ahead." 
WC: "Can I pick up the plans from your house, where do you live." " (Exhibit O, par 24) 
At that time Stap believed from his prior dealings with Collings Construction that it was proposing to tender as the builder. The quotation of Collings
Construction dated 5 March 1991 was in the same form as the Quaglia quotation and offered a price of $92,697 which was divided into the builder fee of $80,697 and the Collings Construction fee of $12,000. Accompanying this quotation was a document entitled "WORK PERFORMED BY COLLINGS HOMES" which detailed fourteen items, many of which were inapplicable as they related to the standard plans of Collings Construction. However, the involvement of
Collings Construction in building work was a little obscure in that the items listed included such work as supplying "job order sheets", liaising "with 30
Suppliers on computer pricing" and preparing a detailed "Computer Set of
Quantities". The documents included one entitled "SPECIAL CONDITIONS &
REQUIREMENTS" which in its printed form was identical with the special conditions given to the Quaglias. Notwithstanding the provision by the Staps of engineer's footing and pier details the special conditions adhered to the provision that the costs of concrete piers and other sub-surface conditions would be treated as a provisional sum and cls 12 and 13 stipulated slab and footing details which were at odds with the engineer's plan supplied by the
Staps. The summary document broke up the contract price of $80,697 into the basic price for a Collings Construction model S.L.3 of $69,697 and a variety of provisional sums which followed the same format as the summary supplied to the Quaglias and the Corbetts. There was also the schedule described as "WORK
ADDITIONALS OUTSIDE TENDER LETTER" which included a sum of $22,503, described as "Extra area as per Owner's plan" a credit of $5,200 for items to be performed by the Staps and a further deduction of $4,000, described as "initial discount". The varied report found that there was the same excessive resort to provisional sum items as in the case of the other owners. The varied report also found that a reasonable contract price, dependent upon standard of finish was between $110,330 and $112,560. This may be compared with Collings
Construction's initial offer of 5 March 1991 of $94,000 for building work after taking into account the unamended work additionals.

By arrangement with Collings, Stap met with him at the Staps' home on 18 March
During this meeting Collings described how he calculated the work additionals. Stap obtained a further discount on the offered price by claiming, untruthfully, that he had a quotation from another builder $2,000 below the Collings Construction price. This increased discount of $2,000 was noted on the work additionals thus reducing the price for building work to $92,000. Stap enquired of Collings what was meant by the term "franchised builder" and, according to the evidence of Stap, there ensued the following conversation: "I then asked him what he meant by "franchise builder" on the quote as it was my understanding that he was to be the builder and I did not understand what an independent franchise builder was.

He said: "It is a builder who will build according to the specifications and detail of Collings Constructions." ...........................

JS: "How long will it take you to build the house?" 
WC: "It will take about three months to get everything worked out but I will not be doing the actual building work, I will use one of my franchise builders, my role at that stage will be to ensure that your house is built in a proficient and workmanlike manner." 
JS: "Who will our builder be?" 
WC: "I have 3 builders working for me at the moment and they are all very good. One has a degree in building, he is highly regarded in the industry and has won a number of awards." 
JS: "Who is he?" 
WC: "His name is Harry Kioussis but I am not certain at this stage whether he will be available for your house. You can imagine how busy a builder with those qualifications is but don't worry the others are first rate tradesmen, any one of them will be fine." " (Exhibit O, pp 16-17, par 38) 
As the Staps had provided their own design plans, Stap raised with Collings the basis of the $12,000 fee payable to Collings Construction. Collings explained the fee as follows: "WC: "I'm performing work too you know and that bears costs".

JS: "But not to the extent of $12,000.00." 
WC: "No I'm aware of that and I've got an arrangement with my builders that in such a case the restitution will go to the builder." 
JS: "So the price is this price, what we have agreed to now. I'm not going to pay any more than this." (I meant the quotation we had agreed on, being $104,000.00) 
WC: "That's correct." " (Exhibit O, par 40) 
The topic of provisional sums was also raised by Stap who was concerned that the provision for sewer connection of $3,000 was adequate for a site which had a steep grade such as the Dural property. According to Stap, Collings described the position concerning provisional sums in the following way.
 "WC: "I've been at the site and it will cost around $2,500.00 to $3,000.00. I took the highest price so I am not under quoting you." 
JS: "Why do you put so much for handling?" 
WC: "Look Jacques, I actually took all those provisional sums at the highest." 
JS: "What do you mean by provisional sums?" 
WC: These are not specific prices, fixed prices, they can vary and that's why
I'm putting them so high so you won't come to the situation where its much more than I've actually quoted for."
Collings also said during the conversation: "Look, its possible that you can get money back on these items" and "I'm sure that you will have money back on some of these prices because I've over inflated them to be sure". " (Exhibit O, pars 41-42) 
The summary, as was usual with Collings Construction quotations, contained a number of provisional sum items which had no sum allocated to them. Stap sought clarification of this provision from Collings who indicated that there would be no charge for such items above the contract price.

The varied report found that most of the provisional sum items were capable of reasonable estimation by a builder and should have been included in the contract price and not treated provisionally.

Sometime in April 1991 Stap informed Collings that the quotation was acceptable and it was arranged for Collings to submit the plans to council for approval. On 28 May 1991 Collings informed Stap in a telephone conversation that the plans had been approved and in this conversation Collings requested a further payment of $11,046. Stap challenged the entitlement of Collings
Construction to anything in addition to $12,000 in response to which Collings explained that the "extra $1,046 is to be deducted from the contract price".
Collings also stated that approximately half of the required sum was being paid to the builder. On 1 June 1991 Stap attended at the office of Collings
Construction where he paid the further sum of $11,046 and signed a form of copyright agreement which treated the payment of $2,000 made in 1990 as part payment of the Collings Construction fee. It was at this meeting that Collings also provided a letter dated 15 May 1991 which was in the following terms: "With regard to progress payments please note that part of the work is performed by Collings Homes and part is performed by the independent builder as indicated in the attached tender.

Please refer to the attached list of work performed by Collings Homes.

The work performed by Collings Homes is paid for in the following progress payments:- 
Progress payment one $2000. 00 prior to plans 
Progress payment two $4000. 00 after plans and prior to (sic) Council 
Progress payment three $7,046. 00 approximately after Council and prior to commencement.

The progress payments one (1) and (2) to Collings Homes are for the following:- 
Standard plans (architectural) 
Standard details (architectural) 
Standard Engineer' details 
Standard council fees 
Standard survey 
Standard administration costs 
The work performed by the builder is normally paid to the builder in the following way : - 
Progress payment one Slab or footings (concrete) 
Progress payment two Roof 
Progress payment three Lock up 
Progress payment four Finish off." (Exhibit O, Annexure JS8A) 
Stap noted that a number of the matters for which Collings Construction purported to charge were inappropriate as the Staps had provided architectural and engineering details. Collings explanation was: "Look, that's an internal matter you won't go over your contract price." 
At this meeting Stap was informed by Collings that Venture would be the builder and of Kioussis he said: "That's Harry Kioussis, I've mentioned him before. You are really fortunate to get such a highly qualified builder, he has a very busy company. I had to work very hard to get him to take on your place." 
In response to a request for references for Venture, Collings stated: "I don't have that sort of information available at my fingertips but I will ask Harry for a list. You won't have any problems with this builder, he's top of the line." 
At this meeting Collings produced a contract which had been executed by
Kioussis but made no request of Stap to execute the document. There was also available at the meeting a work additionals document which Collings completed by noting credits of $4,990 and of $600 for kitchen and other fittings which were being supplied by the Staps. It was Stap's understanding from his initial dealings with Richards in 1990 that the contract price included the items described as "INCLUDED" in the marketing guide.

I think it is inescapable from the evidence of Collings' experience with the
Venture group in relation to the Corbetts and the Quaglias contracts that
Collings was well aware of the commercial untrustworthiness of Venture and of
Kioussis and of Venture's enthusiasm in exploiting the contractual structure established by Collings Construction with the owners. I infer from the warm recommendation of Venture to the Staps in those circumstances that Collings was a knowing and willing participant in Venture's conduct towards the owners.

I think it is reasonably clear from the findings in the varied report that if the contract price as quoted by Collings Construction to the Staps was to be treated as a fixed price for the works shown in the subject drawings, performance of the works would not have permitted the builder to recover costs and any profit under such a contract.

Arrangements were made for the Staps to attend at Venture's premises on 9 July , by which time Stap was becoming concerned at the delay. After being required to wait over an hour the Staps were introduced to Kioussis who left them unattended in his office where they noticed a certificate indicating that
Kioussis had a university degree in building. At this meeting Kioussis presented the Staps with a number of contractual documents which the Staps signed. Included amongst the documents produced was a letter of Venture to the
Staps dated 8 July 1991 which identified Venture as "a independant (sic) franchise builder for Collings Homes and in which we will be carrying out the
Construction of the Collings Design Home prepared for yourselves, with excellance (sic) and in a true craftsman like manner". It described the proposed contract as a "BC3 contract, which has been prepared and approved by the Master Builders Association". The form of contract signed by the Staps was a BC3 form of contract. However, it incorporated the Collings Construction quotation of 5 March 1991, the summary, the work additionals schedule, the marketing guide, the special conditions, and the plain english document. The plain english document had particular significance in the case of the Staps as the work additionals contained the sum of $22,503 said to represent the additional area involved in the Staps' plan when compared with the project home design. The plain english document provided for the payment of a deposit of 5 per cent within seven days of signing of the contract, together with the payment within that time of work additionals. I have no doubt that this was a device of Venture intended to circumvent the 5 per cent limit on deposits imposed by the BSC Act. The plain english document was passed off by
Kioussis to the Staps at this meeting as a document which explained the BC3 contract. Kioussis assured the Staps that the contract produced by him was the same as that earlier produced by Collings Construction. Kioussis made it clear that the Staps would be required to use suppliers nominated by Venture. Of the specification which he required to be signed, he described it as "just a standard specification used by every builder". That was false. Venture's contract document maintained the mechanism of excessive and unreasonable use of provisional sum items as found in the varied report. The documentation was completely confusing, and in my opinion, to such an extent that a person very experienced in the use of building contracts would find it very difficult to follow. Nowhere in the document is the true contract price stated. The price stated of $80,697 was completely illusory, a fact that was unconsciously reflected in the articles of agreement which stated the sources of the Staps' finance in the following way: "Contract Sum: Eighty thousand six hundred ninety seven dollars ($80,697.00) of which ninety three thousand four hundred fifty four dollars ($93,454.00) will be advanced on mortgage by St George Building Society Ltd and balance will be from their own account".

The meeting with Kioussis lasted over four hours during the course of which
Kioussis identified to Stap the items that would involve variation by way of extra. These were some eleven items, none of which were of any particular magnitude. Stap raised with Kioussis the over-payment to Collings Construction of $1,046 which Collings had explained would be deducted from the contract price with Venture. Kioussis disowned any such arrangement and stated that
Stap would "have to take it up with Wayne Collings". Kioussis supplied Stap with some literature concerning his required suppliers and assured Stap that the suppliers nominated by him would be less expensive than those proposed by
Collings Construction. During the course of the meeting Kioussis purported to keep minutes. In the face of hesitancy on the part of the Staps to sign the contract, Kioussis became aggressive. The following conversation preceded the
Staps' execution of the contract: "Harry then asked us to sign the contract. He said to us words to the effect of: "It's the same contract, if you don't sign all works commenced will be stopped." 
Nicole said "Do we have to sign all of this?" 
Harry then became agitated. He said things like: "Collings told you everything so what's the problem." and "Do you want to have a deal or not?" " (Exhibit O, par 107) 
The assurance that the contract was the same as that proffered by Collings
Construction was false. A careful comparison of the two sets of documentation exposes numerous changes in the form of additional variation provisions and provisional sum items together with changes in the method of payment and calculation of liquidated damages.

I accept the evidence of Stap that in signing the contract documents he accepted the assurances of Kioussis made during the course of the meeting. N
Stap was not present throughout the whole of the meeting, she had with her their children and she had not expected the meeting to be as lengthy as it turned out to be. She accepted her husband's assurance that she should sign the contract documents.

At the time of this meeting the Staps remained under the impression that although they were entering into a contract with Venture, Collings
Construction would retain control of supervision over the project. Before the meeting closed Stap requested Kioussis to provide addresses of homes that he had built. Kioussis' response was to state: "I am a wealthy man. I am a family man. I have all these awards (pointing to some framed documents on the wall) I have built for big banks and for Telecom and managed large projects." 
When Stap persisted Kioussis claimed: "I've got a degree in building, I'm one of the few who have a degree in building and if that is not sufficient Mr Stap then I don't know what is." 
Despite further requests for a list of such houses, none was ever provided by
Kioussis.

I am satisfied that, had the Staps understood that the structure of the contractual arrangements initially formulated by Collings Construction and adopted by Venture was such as to make the contract price stipulated in his contract with Venture quite illusory and that Collings Construction would retain no control or interest in the project after payment to it of the so called copyright fee and had they been aware of the fraudulent conduct of
Kioussis and of the incompetence of Venture as a builder they would not have entered into any arrangement with Collings Construction or with Venture.

By letter dated 18 July 1991 Venture forwarded to the Staps what purported to be minutes of the meeting of 9 July 1991. It was inaccurate in significant respects and this matter was taken up with Kioussis by Stap. The reaction of
Kioussis, was to refer Stap to Collings, particularly in relation to the credit for the kitchen and other fittings to be provided by the Staps and the reduction in the contract price by the amount of the overpayment of Collings
Construction. When Stap discussed the matter with Collings he undertook to clear up the matter, but whatever efforts he made in that regard were ineffectual. It was not until March of 1992 that the Staps received repayment of the excess payment to Collings Construction and the dispute concerning the credit for kitchen fittings was never satisfactorily resolved.

The conduct of the Venture group in their dealings with the Staps in the ensuing twelve months reflected the true nature of the Venture organisation.
The performance by Venture of its contract with the Staps was burlesque. Work was done spasmodically with no work being performed for weeks on end. It was performed with lamentable incompetence to the point that when Venture quit the site the Staps were faced with the task of rectification at a cost, as found by the varied report, of $115,502. Much of the detail of this conduct and of incompetent workmanship was not the subject of extensive evidence, largely as a result of the tactic adopted by the Venture group in these proceedings of conceding the failure of Venture to perform its contract.

It was submitted on behalf of Venture that much of the evidence of the Venture group's conduct in purporting to perform its contracts with the respective owners was irrelevant. In part, that submission was based upon the proposition that much of the alleged conduct, if established, was in the nature of a novus actus and did not form part of the contraventions alleged by the Commission against Venture. Particular rulings on those submissions were published in writing and form part of the documents marked for identification 19. However,
I think it is useful to further comment on that objection in relation to the evidence led by the Staps. In my opinion, the submissions on behalf of Venture place too narrow an interpretation on the nature of the conduct alleged against the Venture group. Essentially, that conduct consisted of a deception, in large measure fraudulent, in Venture holding itself out as a highly qualified building organisation when in truth it was one in the nature of a predator which was unscrupulous and incompetent: one which induced owners to enter into contracts which were deceptively presented as fixed price contracts when, in fact, they were structured to create contract prices which were illusory and did not represent the real or probable cost of the subject works - contracts which contained a mechanism for the recovery by Venture of significantly greater sums than those stipulated as the contract prices.
Viewed in that way the experience of the Staps at the hands of the Venture group was merely a reflection of that nature of the Venture organisation.

After Venture entered upon performance of the contract it was several months before the Staps realised that Collings Construction had retained no control over the performance by Venture of that contract. Over that period they believed that the considerable sum that had been paid to Collings Construction was, in part, a fee to ensure continued control over the project by Collings
Construction. Further, for several months the Staps had no knowledge of the incompetence of Venture in performing the contract, notwithstanding the inspection of the works from time to time by the lender's inspector for the purpose of progress payments. However, from the outset of performance by
Venture, the Staps had reason to be concerned with the legitimacy of variation claims that were submitted by Venture. Although the evidence of this aspect is somewhat sketchy I think it is reasonably clear that, from the variation claims dated 29 November 1991 received by the Staps on 4 December 1991, the
Venture group was attempting to take dishonest advantage of the scope within the contract for claims additional to the contract price. I think this dishonesty was reflected in inflated variation claims and in Venture's refusal, in a number of instances, to provide supporting cost data to the
Staps. Included in those claims was an amount of $2,280 for "Amended Plans
Engineer Drawings". That claim was blatantly dishonest. There was a further claim for over $1,000 for certain brickwork notwithstanding that the work was shown on the architectural plans obtained by the Staps and upon which
Collings Construction had quoted. There were further claims for several thousand dollars, allegedly for additional concrete and piers. Much of the work the subject of these claims had been performed several months prior to the receipt of these variation claims.

Concerned at the apparent lack of involvement of Collings Construction in the project, the Staps called on Collings, without appointment, at the office of
Collings Construction on 18 January 1992. During this meeting they relayed their complaints of the way in which Venture was administering the contract and obtained the assurance of Collings that he would look into it and "work it out" with Kioussis.

On 4 February 1992 a meeting was arranged at the office of Venture at which was present Kioussis, an employee of Venture and the Staps. Stap gave the following evidence concerning the introductory conversation that took place: "190. ..........

JS: "Where is Wayne Collings, he should be here too?" 
HK: "I don't want to have him in this meeting, he has nothing to do with the building work." 
JS: "He told me he would oversee the building work." 
HK: "That's not it at all. I'm the licensed builder and Wayne Collings has nothing to do with it at all. You've got a contract with Venture Industries and not with Wayne Collings." 
HK: "Collings Constructions, whatever Wayne says, is not relevant Jacques".
Up until that moment I had always thought that it was Wayne who had the responsibility to overview the quality of work and with whom I could discuss matters of costing and prices etc. I realised during this meeting, for the first time, that Wayne Collings did not have any responsibility or role in the matter. I was overwhelmed at that time, and astonished, and I did not know how to continue...." (Exhibit O, pars 190 and 191) 
At this meeting, which became acrimonious, Kioussis gave the Staps several further variation claims. Following this meeting, Venture forwarded to the
Staps a document purported to be minutes of the meeting which incorrectly recorded acceptance by the Staps of several variations. This was corrected by
Stap in his letter to Venture of 14 February 1992.

As a result of the meeting of 4 February 1992, the Staps attended on Collings, again without appointment, at the Collings Construction office on 8 February
After being required to wait for some time Stap had an angry conversation with Collings in which he accused Collings of having got them into a "mess" and demanded that Collings "get (them) out of it". Stap rejected
Collings attempt at prevarication in no uncertain terms and repeated his demand that Collings take some steps to control Kioussis' conduct having regard to the fee paid by the Staps to Collings Construction. This drew the following response form Collings: "WC "I don't know if I can arrange that because Harry Kioussis and I don't have any business with each other any more. I think that Harry Kioussis' problem is also because I gave him seven jobs at once between July and August last year and he told me he could manage it. It seems that he is not." " (Exhibit O, part of par 226) 
At about this time the lease of the premises which the Staps had been occupying expired and they moved into a caravan on the Dural property. It was also at this time that the Staps brought in a building consultant, John
Beresford (Beresford), whose fee, to the extent of $350.00, Collings agreed to pay. Beresford inspected the works at the end of February. The paragraphs of
Stap's affidavit evidence in chief sworn 3 December 1993 (exhibit O) dealing with Beresford's further involvement with the subject works were not read when the affidavit was admitted into evidence. There were a number of other paragraphs in Stap's affidavit, relating to damages, which were not read. The same course was adopted by the Commission in relation to the affidavits of other owners. This was done in an endeavour to exclude evidence of defective work as that issue was considered to have been resolved by Venture's concessions and by the varied report. When items of damage were challenged as to their reasonableness during the course of submissions on behalf of Venture, the Commission responded by seeking to tender these paragraphs not previously read Those paragraphs were particularised in writing and were marked for identification 17.

As appears from the transcript of submissions of 13 November 1995 objection was taken to this tender on the basis that Venture would be prejudiced if the material was admitted without the opportunity for further cross-examination.
As appears from the transcript at 1011 in relation to similar material in the evidence of damages claimed by the Tantis I had some difficulty in accepting that there was any real prejudice to the Venture group should the material be admitted without leave to further cross-examine (T1011 - 1013). In deferring ruling on the material objected to I stated to counsel for the Venture group as follows: "I will give you the opportunity of including in your submission any particular further submission you wish to make in relation to this proposed tender" 
I am not aware of any further submissions presented by counsel as to prejudice should this material be admitted without leave to further cross-examine. It will be noted that no objection to this material was taken on behalf of the
Collings group and accordingly the additional paragraphs will be admitted against the Collings group and added to the exhibits of affidavits of which they form part. In the case of the Venture group, the course I have decided to follow, having considered the tender in the cases of all of the owners, is to reject the tender in each case. I have done so in view of the Venture group's claims of prejudice if the material was admitted without permitting further cross-examination. No one suggested that it would have been appropriate to reopen the Commission's case at that stage of the hearing to permit such cross-examination to take place.

The first quarter of 1992 was marked by a series of acrimonious exchanges between Kioussis and Stap, particularly over several further claims by Venture for additional payments. Included in those claims was an amount of $6,523 for brickwork which had been performed over six months prior to the receipt of the variation claim. There were repeated claims made by Kioussis and Venture, that the Staps were in breach of their contractual obligations to make project payments to Venture. I have not found it necessary to examine each of those particular issues. It is apparent, however, in a number of instances, even if
Venture had been otherwise properly executing the works, the claims were, in whole or in part, unfounded. There were occasions when Kioussis threatened
Stap with litigation and arbitration. During these confrontations Kioussis refused to provide substantiating invoices for variations or to attend site to discuss the construction problems which had emerged in this period. It was the view of Kioussis that it was "common law to have these kinds of meetings at the registered office of the company". I regard that conduct of the Venture group as part of a pattern of harassment of the Staps aimed at forcing payment of Venture's unfounded claims.

On 29 April 1992 Venture gave to Stap two notices dated respectively 21 April and 28 April 1992 purporting to notify practical completion of the works as at March 1992 and giving notice of dispute and of an intention to commence arbitration proceedings. It is clear from the evidence of Stap that the subject works, however badly constructed, could not be described reasonably as in a state of practical completion.

At the end of April 1992 the Staps consulted the Corporation for its assistance in the worsening contractual situation with Venture. Shortly after this, Beresford attended at the site with a builder, Phillip Cotton (Cotton), to carry out an inspection. Cotton later carried out the rectification and rebuilding of the subject works for the Staps. On 7 May 1992 the Staps submitted a complaint form supported by a report of Beresford to the
Corporation. At about the same time Venture gave written notice of its intention to commence arbitration against the Staps and on 8 May 1992 they received formal notice of dispute dated 7 May 1992 requiring the reference of the dispute to arbitration if it was not settled within seven days. This was followed by a notice from Venture that a caveat had been placed on the Dural property. Between May and July 1992 the Staps were subjected to conduct by the
Venture group which included acts of a criminal nature. Notwithstanding the notice of dispute, Venture continued to submit variation claims to the Staps and in the months of June and July purported to carry out rectification work.
This work was carried out in the presence of P Kioussis and a person apparently in the employ of Venture, Arthur Magaitas (Magaitas), who gave instructions to various sub-contractors involved in this attempt at rectification. P Kioussis had taken over as supervisor of the works on 26
March 1992. The conduct of Magaitas in the presence of P Kioussis and at other times was extremely offensive and threatening to the Staps. No attempt was made during the performance of rectification work to protect floors or furniture in the Staps' home. On one occasion when Beresford was on site P
Kioussis' conduct was quite offensive to him.

On another occasion Magaitas said to N Stap: "Keep your mouth shut you bitch" and used offensive language in her presence and that of the Staps' children.
He occupied the house as though it was his own, using the telephone without permission and using their radio as he pleased. On 10 July 1992 Magaitas sat in a car parked outside the Dural property throughout the whole of the day. At :00 pm two workmen arrived to put plastic covering over the open wall at the rear of the house. The Staps had no notice of this arrangement. After 8:00 pm, when the workmen and Magaitas refused to leave the property, the Staps were forced to obtain the assistance of the police. Between 10 July and 15 July P Kioussis and Magaitas were present on the site while bricklayers attempted rectification of brickwork on the home. Bricks removed from the defective work were thrown onto a vegetable garden. All of the new bricks were carted through the house over rugs without any attempt to cover the floors or furniture which was damaged in the process. Whilst the bricklaying was in progress, Beresford arrived and requested that the carting of cement should be performed by an external lift and not through the house. This drew the response from Magaitas: "Fuck off, we will do it how I want to do it" and to N Stap he shouted: "Listen, we do it like we want to do it and you bloody just accept that. You said you wanted it fixed not us." 
On the last day of the attempted rectification work, namely 15 July 1992, both
P Kioussis and Magaitas used extremely offensive language to the Staps and
Magaitas assaulted Stap and generally threatened him. In this conduct he was encouraged by P Kioussis. In her affidavit of evidence in chief sworn 15 April (exhibit T), N Stap gave evidence of other extraordinarily offensive behaviour by both P Kioussis and Magaitas during the course of this attempt at rectification work.
 July 1992 was the last date upon which Venture was permitted to carry out rectification work. On 16 July 1992 Magaitas arrived on the site and only left after police assistance was obtained. It was in the end of July 1992 that the
Staps learned of the fraudulent representations of Kioussis concerning his building qualifications.

On an evening in early August 1992 a brick was thrown through a front window of the Staps' home and acid was poured over their vehicle. At the time the
Staps were in bed and were aroused by the noise. N Stap recognised P Kioussis running along the Staps' driveway towards a four wheel drive vehicle which she recognised as similar to the one usually driven by P Kioussis. I am satisfied that that was not the only occasion that P Kioussis was involved in such behaviour. N Stap gave evidence that a camera, which she had been using to photograph the rectification work being attempted by Venture, was ruined by some substance which she observed P Kioussis spraying on the camera. I formed the opinion that Stap and N Stap were reliable in their evidence. Each presented as intelligent and responsive in their answers in cross-examination.
Their evidence was given without hesitation. They were firm in their denials of Collings' version of events. In his affidavit sworn 9 March 1995 (exhibit
D1-29) Collings gave a detailed version of his initial meetings with the Staps in which he claimed to have explained in great detail the way in which the costing was made up and the respective functions of Collings Construction and
Venture. For the most part it is at odds with the evidence of the Staps and I have no hesitation in rejecting it.

Shortly after these events the Staps left the Dural property to avoid further confrontation with representatives of Venture. I have been left in no doubt as to the truth of their evidence concerning the conduct of Collings Construction and Venture and of the involvement of Collings, Kioussis and P Kioussis in the manner set out in these reasons. Further, in my opinion, there is no room for doubt that, but for that conduct, they would not have entered into any contractual arrangements with Collings Construction or Venture.

The Smiths 
The contract price quoted by Collings Construction to the Smiths was $100,227 in addition to the Collings Construction fee of $12,000. When account was taken of work additionals the real contract price, if it could be so described, was $107,249. The Collings Construction quotation was dated 7
November 1990 although the contract entered into with Venture was dated 1
August 1991. The varied report found that a reasonable price for the work including builder's profit was between $133,700 and $136,500. The varied report also found that the reasonable cost of necessary rectification work by way of demolition and rebuilding and of completing the works was $152,838.

In cross-examination Smith presented as undemonstrative, frank, direct in his answers and left no indication of prevarication. He appeared to be on top of the facts and I regarded his evidence as reliable. In the case of L Smith I observed her to be a shy person, transparently honest with a poor recollection of some matters but frank in the giving of her evidence which reflected no attempt of evasion. She tended to leave decision making to Smith in their dealings with Collings Construction and Venture. In some matters she was outspoken in her rejection of matters put to her. Referring to an occasion late in 1991 when she relayed to Collings the problems that Venture was creating on site, she referred to Kioussis as a person who "couldn't build a dog house". She rejected the version of an event as put to her by Collings as "garbage".

L Smith acquired the property at Galston (the Galston property) from her parents in early 1990. With the intention of developing the Galston property, the Smiths visited Home World where they became interested in the Collings
Construction design described as the "Louisiana". The Smiths had acquired a
PHB guide which contained the misleading description of Collings Homes as a builder. Their first contact with Collings was in September 1990 on a further visit to Home World. The next contact with Collings Construction was later in
September when Smith had further discussions with Richards concerning the possibility of building a Collings Construction home. They discussed changes to the basic Louisiana layout and the various costs of changes. Further discussions continued into October. At a meeting on 2 October 1990 Richards produced a preliminary plan and at one held on 27 October he submitted a
Collings Construction quotation in the form which had been submitted to other owners. The quote was for $112,227 made up of the building "fee" of $100,227 and the copyright fee of $12,000. It was accompanied by a summary which showed a basic price of $92,187 followed by numerous items described as provisions.
Only five of those items had sums allocated to them. Together with the basic price they made up the "Contract Price" of $100,227. The special conditions provided for additional costs for sub-surface work including concrete piers and provided for costing on a standard slab and footing basis. There was also provided a work additionals schedule totalling $9,096 which reflected the changes which had been discussed between Richards and Smith.

The varied report found that the use of provisional sum items in the majority of cases, was unrecoverable and that they were capable of reliable estimation for inclusion in the contract price without any provisional tag being attached to them.

At the meeting of 27 October 1990 several further changes were proposed by
Smith. I think it is fair to say that in their dealings with Collings
Construction the Smiths were prone to second thoughts on the changes that had been discussed to the basic plan and that this process, to some degree, continued into early 1991.

On 4 November 1990, Smith attended Collings Construction's office to discuss further changes and inquired of Richards whether the prices on previous alterations to the basic model had been finalised. They had not. A few days later, on 7 November, the Smiths returned to Collings Construction's office where they were given by Richards a further quotation and a summary, a document entitled "WORK PERFORMED BY COLLINGS HOMES" in the same form as earlier described in these reasons and a work additionals schedule totalling $12,896 which reflected further changes that had been made by the Smiths in discussion with Richards. At this meeting several further changes were proposed by Smith, which brought the "total price .... to $122,509 less the builder's discount" which was agreed at $5,000. It is not clear to me how that sum was made up by Richards. The document on which Richards obtained the
Smiths' signature simply showed that total amount on a work additionals schedule which identified only $1,020 in additional items. As that document records, the Smiths agreed with Richards on a "Builder's Discount of $5,000".
It was probably at this meeting that a deposit of $2,000 was requested by
Richards and paid by Smith. While L Smith left decisions to Smith, it is clear from her evidence that throughout the months of the Smiths' dealings with
Collings Construction, she understood that Collings Construction would be the builder. It was not until late in 1990 that she realised that a builder other than Collings Construction would be actually building their proposed home.
Even so, from the manner in which Collings Construction dealt with the Smiths, in its advertising material, from the nature of its quotations and the obtaining of significant sums by way of "deposit" she was led to believe that
Collings Construction would maintain, at least, a supervisory role in the building of the home. She shared this understanding with Smith. He was cross- examined at length concerning his understanding of the role of Collings
Construction and I am satisfied that the way in which Collings Construction dealt with the Smiths led him to the firm belief that Collings Construction would be involved in the building of the home. Initially he understood
Collings Construction was the actual builder. It was only in November 1990 that it was explained to him by Richards that another organisation would be involved in the building. Richards explained the situation in the following terms when questioned by Smith about the introduction of another organisation as the builder: "We used to build ourselves, but we stopped because we figured we could give better service by overseeing the project. Now we can keep better track of the constructions when we don't have to keep track of the actual building." 
In all, over $14,000 was extracted by Collings Construction as a deposit prior to referring the Smiths to Venture and I have had no difficulty in accepting the evidence of the Smiths that they fully expected Collings Construction to maintain an active role in ensuring that the arrangement made with Collings
Construction would be followed through by Venture. In meetings between Smith and Richards in November 1990 further changes were discussed. Up to this stage no plans had been produced for council approval. During December the Smiths visited several suppliers whose names had been provided to them by Richards with the view to making selection of materials and fittings for the proposed works.

On 28 December 1990 Smith visited the office of Collings Construction and was there shown by Richards a plan on which he secured Smith's signature before providing Smith with a copy together with a copy of specifications. The specifications were in the usual form.

Early in January, Smith discussed further changes to the basic plan with
Richards and on 14 January 1991, Smith was given a further work additionals schedule on which was noted extras totalling $12,022 less a builder's discount of $5,000. This gave a contract price of $107,249 to which there was to be added the fee to Collings Construction of $12,000. Richards noted the total amount payable of $119,249 on the work additionals schedule. Approximately a week after this meeting Smith attended Collings Construction office where he was given a further quotation dated 7 November 1990, a summary and a work additionals schedule which accorded with that which had been provided on 13
January 1991. On this occasion, however, Smith complained that there were items on the schedule that were incorrect. It appears that at about this time
Venture submitted a building application for council approval. This appeared from a letter dated 4 February 1991 from Hornsby Shire Council to the Smiths which referred to Venture's application for building approval. The evidence of
Smith was that he may have noticed the reference to Venture at the time although he had no recollection of it. Council at that time objected to the proposal and required a set back of the proposed building from the road frontage of some 30 metres. In order to overcome this the Smiths engaged a consultant who assisted them in their submission in March 1991 of a development application to the council seeking relief from this requirement.
It was not until the end of May that development approval was given by the council and a further month before building approval was given. Although some delay in obtaining council approval could be laid at the door of Collings
Construction, much of it could not. Much of the delay was due, in my opinion, to a climate of change promoted by the Smiths and to their attempt to obtain relief from council's requirements.

In favour of Collings Construction it should be noted that, though several months had elapsed since agreement had been reached on the basic quotation of
Collings Construction, it did not seek to increase that quotation on the basis that, with the passage of time, the costs of construction had inevitably increased. It also seems clear that no firm budget had ever been stipulated by the Smiths to Collings Construction and the estimated cost of the proposed works underwent continual change with different requirements being requested by the Smiths in the latter half of 1990 into early 1991. Moreover, it is clear that Smith had a reasonable understanding of the nature of provisional sum items and was aware that over and above the extras set out in the work additionals schedule there would be an extra in the foundation required for the proposed piers. Nevertheless, Smith understood the stated provisional sums to be a "true estimate of the cost of standard items of that kind". Cross- examination of Smith established that he did not seek clarification of the provisional sum items to which no amount had been allocated and that he understood that the provisional sums were not fixed costs but were estimates, so that the contract price could vary up or down according to actual cost. He did not expect costs to exceed provisional allowances (T351.30 - 352). In the case of provisional sum items to which no amount had been allocated he assumed that those items had no application to the subject contract (T355.26). It is also clear that Smith was well aware of the need for foundations in the form of the piers, the cost of which was not included in the Collings Construction quotation (T353.17, 357.5). Smith was aware of this additional cost even though no sum was allocated to the items for piers and beams in the Collings
Construction quotation (T354.29). However Smith rejected the suggestion that he expected a similar treatment of other provisional sum items to which no provisional sum had been allocated to be the subject of contract price variation(T354.38).

In April 1991 Smith received a phone call from a representative of Exclusive
Kitchens to whom they had been earlier referred by Richards and with whom selections of kitchen fittings had been made by L Smith. The representative warned of a pending price rise and in order to secure stock at the prices discussed with L Smith, Exclusive Kitchens extracted a $500 deposit from
Smith.

During May there was little progress, mainly due to the hold up in obtaining development and building approval by the council. There were communications between Smith and Collings - Richards having left the employment of Collings
Construction - in which Smith experienced some difficulty in obtaining a "typed" schedule of additional works. I do not regard that matter of any significance. With the exception of two or three items of no particular magnitude, the quotation of Collings Construction had been agreed upon by the
Smiths. Smith also notified Collings Construction of the need for amended plans to accord with the changed location of the proposed works in the development application before Council.

On 26 May 1991 Smith visited the Collings Construction office. Collings took the opportunity to request payment of "the balance for the plans and everything" of $12,233. Smith reminded Collings of the payment of a deposit of $2,000 to which Collings replied: "The total Collings figure works out to be $14,233 of which you have paid $2,000. My allowance is calculated on a percentage of the total. The total has been increased by the work additionals, so of course the amount goes up. Don't worry about it, all it means is that the builder's price is that much less so your total cost stays the same. This just changes the splitting up of the total amount between the builder and myself. Once you pay the balance of this, then we can proceed with the builder." 
As in other instances, I think this statement evidences the integral nature of
Collings Construction quote of a building fee and a design fee. In response to this Smith paid the balance as requested on 1 June 1991 and, at the request of
Collings, signed a copyright agreement in the usual form. At this meeting
Collings mentioned the names of two possible builders for the subject works, one of which was Venture. In cross-examination Smith accepted that he was given a choice of two builders although he maintained that Collings "suggested" Venture. (T359.25) The evidence in chief of Smith was clear to the effect that he understood the arrangement with Collings Construction to be such that Collings Construction was obliged to oversee construction of the building once a building contract was entered into with another organisation.
In cross-examination this understanding was restated. At the meeting of 1 June Smith took the opportunity of raising errors in the work additionals schedule.

Before leaving the meeting he was provided with a BC3 contract which was described by Collings as a "standard everyday building contract" to take "away and have a look at it". There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the document which was received at this meeting was anything other than a standard
BC3 form of contract.

Towards the end of July 1991 Smith had a number of conversations with Collings in which he unsuccessfully sought to obtain a final work additionals schedule and at a meeting on 28 July 1991 between Collings and Smith at the Collings
Construction office arrangements were made for the Smiths to meet Kioussis on August 1991. Collings had encouraged the Smiths to accept Venture as a builder at a meeting on 21 July 1991. At that meeting Collings stated to
Smith: "You really should go ahead with Venture Industries because they've already got your paper work and they are ready to go. They are keen for work. Venture is a good builder. Its owned by Harry Kioussis." 
Smith's response was: "Yeah, fine. You're the expert." 
I think the findings I have made concerning Collings knowledge of the untrustworthiness of Venture from his experience with that organisation's conduct towards other owners leads to the inference that he was well aware of what was likely to happen to the Smiths in the hands of Venture and that he was a knowing and willing participant in that exploitation.

On 1 August 1991, as arranged, the Smiths attended Venture's office where they met Kioussis who described himself as being in building for a number of years and very experienced in construction which involved "quality work". At the outset of this meeting he informed the Smiths as follows: "You are finished with Collings Homes now. From now on, you only deal with me.
Collings Homes has nothing more to do with the building of your house." 
Smith was "taken aback" by this statement but, having paid over $14,000 to
Collings Construction, he felt compelled to proceed with Venture. Kioussis had a set of documents ready for discussion with the Smiths. Discussion ranged over formal matters, such as source of finance, and there then began a series of references to particular items which Kioussis indicated would be a variation to the contract works. To some of these Smith appears to have raised no objection. However, when the same approach was adopted to items which had been the subject of agreement with Collings Construction and which had been provided for in the work additionals, Smith objected most strongly to Kioussis attempting to treat that arrangement as not binding on Venture. During the course of these discussions P Kioussis was introduced to the Smiths by
Kioussis as the person who would be supervising construction. When discussion turned to the provision of kitchen fittings, the Smiths informed Kioussis of their payment of a deposit to Exclusive Kitchens, only to be informed by
Kioussis that he did not deal with that organisation and they would have to secure return of their deposit. There were a number of other items that
Kioussis forewarned would be an extra, but, in response to a request for an intimation of price, he stated that he was not in a position to provide that information at that stage. Before signing any documents Kioussis maintained that due to the passage of time this could involve a "rise and fall in the cost of the timber and the concrete and roof tiles".

After the meeting had been in progress some hours, Kioussis produced documents for signing. The BC3 contract he described as the standard contract, the same as that given to the Smiths by Collings Construction. It was not a standard form. It contained a number of provisions, which on the face of it, were peculiar to Venture. The "special conditions" section incorporated the
Collings Construction quotation documents, its marketing guide and specification. This specification did not include page 9 which sets out PC items. While this omission does not appear to be significant, the reason for its omission is not clear to me. In addition to architectural and engineer's drawings, the special conditions incorporated "special conditions, item 1-16 attached" and "Annexure A" each of which were in the usual form, the latter being the plain english document.

In the plain english document Venture retained the illegal provision of requiring payment of a 5 per cent deposit together with the value of the work additionals within seven days of the signing of the contract. It contained a series of provisional sum items without any allocation of an amount to those items. It set out PC items which may explain the absence of page 9 in the specifications. It maintained a "standard home" allowance for the footings, slab and piers notwithstanding engineer's details capable of estimation by a competent builder. This use of provisional sum items was found in the varied report as unjustified and adherence to outmoded specifications mean that the stipulated contract price was a superseded price at the time of contract.

Having signed the BC3 form of contract, Smith noticed that there had been no allowance for the excess of payment made by the Smiths to Collings
Construction. He raised this matter with Kioussis who denied any knowledge of it and in the presence of the Smiths spoke to Collings by telephone. The upshot of that discussion was an offer by Kioussis to set off the excess payment against "any variations that might crop up during construction". This was a study in understatement.

As a general approach to the Smiths' case I think that there are aspects which distinguish their case from those of the other owners. There was, in my opinion, a looseness in the contract price brought about by a continuous series of changes over several months that continued even into the first meeting with Kioussis. Further, Smith well understood that the contract price plus the value of work additionals did not represent the total contract price in that he understood foundation works would be extra, even though no sum had been allocated to that provisional sum item. Although there was no evidence led to support the proposition that between October 1990 and mid 1991 the consumer price index had increased in the building and construction industry, it is nevertheless surprising that the Collings quotation was adhered to by it throughout that period.

However, in examining the conduct of Collings Construction in relation to the
Smiths, one has to be reminded that the referee's report as adopted found that the reasonable price for the subject works was between $133,700 and $136,500 which has to be compared with the sum of $107,249 quoted by Collings
Construction. This figure is derived from the contract price and work additionals quoted by Collings Construction less the fee quoted by that company of $12,000. (In fact $14,233 was paid which reduced the building component to $105,016). There should be added to that sum of $107,249 a figure for the concrete piers. The varied report found that $600 should have been provisionally allowed for piers. The inevitable conclusion in my opinion is that the quotation as submitted by Collings Construction was significantly underquoted and one is driven to conclude, as in the case of other owners, that the structure of the quotation was designed to permit an illusory competitive contract price to be presented by Collings Construction and
Venture. The varied report found that the reasonable price for the Venture contract works should have been between $129,610 and $132,067, depending on standard of finish.

Collings maintained that his competitive pricing structure was not the product of deception, rather that it reflected the ability of Collings Construction to obtain highly competitive prices from suppliers with whom it had a longstanding and effective commercial relationship. It was also contended by
Collings that a pricing data bank was maintained by a computer which gave
Collings Construction ready access to keenly priced quotations for its various constructions. Collings further contended that this pricing system was bolstered by prices calculated on a cost per square basis for which builders were prepared to construct Collings Construction standard design homes. I think it is significant the evidence produced by Collings, for example, in the form of what was called the black book and a lodex print-out gave little or no support for this part of the Collings Construction case. For example, I think it is stretching credulity to treat that material as evidencing an advantageous relationship between Collings Construction and any suppliers or as evidencing an accurate reflection of costing data which would justify the prices quoted by Collings Construction. There may have been a time, possibly when Collings Construction was engaged in building, when there was an accurate pricing database and a relationship with suppliers which guaranteed competitive pricing. Even assuming that to be so, I think it is painfully obvious that under the management of Collings, that system, if it ever existed in a reliable form, had ceased to have any real worth to the business as conducted by Collings Construction in the period with which this litigation is concerned. Cross-examination of Collings, which sought to test the lodex print-out against Collings Construction's listed prices, I think demonstrated that. Further, I note that Collings chose not to give such evidence before the referee when I consider it would have been appropriate for him to do so. It was suggested that he had not done so as any expert evidence from him would necessarily be tainted with self-interest. I think that misses the point. I am more inclined to the view that his failure to do so was more a reflection of the paucity of the evidence which he was able to adduce on this subject.

In his affidavit evidence in reply, Collings, as he testified in relation to other owners, claimed to have discussed in detail the structure of the
Collings Construction quotation. In large part, this was denied by Smith in cross-examination and I have little hesitation in accepting the version of
Smith. In particular, I am satisfied that the Smiths had no idea that they were going to be left to their own resources once they were placed into the hands of Venture. Both in their communications with Collings Construction and in the material provided by Collings Construction to the Smiths, I am of the opinion that they were fully entitled to have the understanding that Collings
Construction would have the responsibility of seeing that the works the subject of its quotation were performed in accordance with that quote. There are a number of areas in the affidavit evidence of Collings which Smith accepted as having some factual foundation but, except in relation to the cost of footings, these areas of agreement were not significant, in my opinion.

In structuring the contract price on the shoulders of so called provisional sum items, which had the effect of robbing it of any reliability, in causing the Smiths to operate under the misapprehension that Collings Construction would see the project through to conclusion and not retire from the scene once a substantial fee had been extracted from the Smiths and in putting the Smiths into the predatory hands of Venture knowing of its untrustworthiness, I have been left in no doubt that Collings Construction was guilty of proscribed conduct as alleged and that Collings was a knowing party to that conduct. I think Collings Construction bears a heavy responsibility in relation to its conduct in referring the Smiths to Venture. While I am not satisfied that
Collings was aware of the incompetence of Venture at the time he referred the
Smiths to Venture or that he was aware of the fraudulent nature of the claims by Kioussis that he possessed degree qualifications, I think it is clear that he was aware that Venture was willing to exploit the contractual structure initiated by Collings Construction and that he had good reason to believe that
Venture would take advantage of the situation to abrogate arrangements reached between the owners and Collings Construction. For these reasons I think
Collings Construction and Collings were knowing parties to that conduct of
Venture.

The contract signed with Venture contained several additional provisions for variations, several more provisional items and a number of different contractual provisions when compared with the contract documents of Collings
Construction.

What was, in effect, a deposit of $13,772 was paid by the Smiths to Venture in the second half of August 1991 and approximately a week or two later a first progress payment of $25,056 was requested and paid. In October Smith was required to travel overseas and be absent from Australia for approximately two months. L Smith accompanied him for the first week and then returned to
Australia. The Smiths left Australia on 6 October 1991 and L Smith returned on October 1991. Smith returned to Australia on 9 December 1991 to be confronted by disputes with P Kioussis over the rectification of a defective slab. It appears that there had been one prior unsatisfactory attempt at rectification and that P Kioussis was trying to arrange for the concreter to attempt further rectification work. Smith was unimpressed by the work that had been performed in his absence, and referred P Kioussis to Beresford. This drew a response later that day from Kioussis who informed Smith that Venture would not deal with Beresford and that in his opinion the defects were minor. During
Smith's absence the Smiths appointed Beresford to act as a supervisor. The response of Venture to the appointment of Beresford was quite extraordinary and was set out in its letter to the Smiths of 8 November 1991 in the following terms: "We object to you appointing a consultant to supervisor (sic) our work. During construction of the project, the Proprietor cannot appoint a consultant to take over on behalf of the Proprietor to supervise the project. The Proprietor is to use the services of a consultant from time to time during construction and to advise the Proprietor at their own expense, but the Builder does not deal direct with the consultant and the consultant direct with the builder.

The contract is between ourselves and yourselves and not with the consultant.

We wish to advise that we will not be dealing direct with the consultant at any time, but only direct with yourselves." 
By letter of 18 November 1991 Venture submitted its second progress claim for $25,056 this was followed a day later by a letter demanding that there be no contact between the Smiths and Venture labour or sub-contract labour suppliers and asserting that Venture had engaged a solicitor at the cost of the Smiths.
This clearly was an absurd claim. A week later Venture submitted a variation claim for $1,610. On 20 November 1991 it submitted its second variation claim for $2,390 which included $2,080 for "Amended Plans - Engineer Drawings". On the face of it, this claim was without foundation having regard to the monies previously paid by the Smiths to Collings Construction and, in my opinion, it formed part of a pattern of Venture's treatment of the owners in making inflated or groundless claims. On 29 November 1991 variation claim number four for concreting work was submitted in the sum of $4,130.

There is little doubt that the Smiths had cause for considerable dissatisfaction with conditions on site as at December 1991. It is quite extraordinary in those circumstances that by notice dated 3 December 1991
Venture gave notice of dispute with a view to referring that dispute to arbitration. I have no doubt that it was the practice of Venture to harass the owners with threats of stoppages, litigation or arbitration and by placing caveats on the titles to their properties. I regard this notice as an example of that conduct.

The month of December was marked by a series of allegations and demands by
Venture including a request to arbitrate the so called dispute. Further demands were made for payment of variations numbered one to four and as a result of these communications the Smiths were forced to seek legal advice. At the end of December representatives of Venture arrived on site without any approved structural plans to carry out rectification work on the foundation concrete. The Smiths would not permit them to do this work. Later that month the Smiths arranged other building inspections of the works.

On 3 February 1992 the MBA, by letter dated 31 January 1992, informed the
Smiths that an arbitrator had been appointed pursuant to Venture's notice of dispute.

A preliminary hearing of the arbitration took place on 12 February 1992. There were a series of site meetings to inspect the works during February. On 10
March 1992, Venture by letter dated 28 February 1992, informed the Smiths that variation number two had been cancelled in view of a payment by Collings
Construction of the amount claimed. A further report was received from a structural engineer, Edward Reed (Reed), whom the Smiths had retained. By notice dated 10 April 1992 the Smiths notified Venture of their determination of its employment under the contract.
 
This notice of determination by the Smiths was responded to by Venture treating the notice as a repudiation. A further notice of default was given by the Smiths on 24 April 1992 which drew a similar response from Venture to that given to the earlier notice.

The varied report found that the cost of demolition of the defective work and rebuilding was $155,450. However it was noted that the original contract for this rectification work did not call for full demolition and accordingly the varied report found that $152,838 represented the reasonable cost of rectification and rebuilding. The conduct of Venture in relation to the
Smiths, in substance, is indistinguishable from the contravention committed by it in its dealings with the owners. The same may be said of Collings
Construction's conduct. There is no doubt that the Smiths were deceived by that conduct in the manner alleged and would not have entered into any arrangement with Collings Construction or Venture had they known the true position.

The Grimstons 
The dealings between Collings Construction and the Grimstons and between
Venture and the Grimstons, for the most part, fit into the same sorry pattern reflected in the experience of the other owners. Perhaps the one point of departure lies in the evidence of Grimston of his understanding of the part played by work additionals in the Grimstons' arrangements with Collings
Construction and Venture. So far as one can extract the contract price from the arrangements entered into by the Grimstons with Collings Construction and
Venture, that contract price of $85,600 may be compared with the finding in the varied report that the reasonable price for construction of the works the subject of the Collings Construction quotation was between $111,640 and $113,730, depending upon standard of finish.

Alternatively, for works the subject of the Venture contract the varied report estimated a reasonable price was between $114,830 and $119,511.

The varied report further found that the cost of rectification and completion of the works including partial demolition totalled $128,320. Although I was not particularly impressed with S Grimston as a witness, I found her convincing under cross-examination in which she gave her answers firmly, if not with some fierceness on occasions. I have no occasion to question her honesty in giving evidence. Grimston presented as quite aggressive in cross- examination, being particularly forthright in his denials which were sometimes tinged with bitterness. Subject to one matter, he gave his evidence in a precise way without any attempt at prevarication. Where I found his evidence unsatisfactory was in his stated understanding of the part played by the work additionals in the contract price. Subject to that, I formed the impression that the evidence of the Grimstons was reliable.

In late 1990 the Grimstons sold their then residence and moved into rented accommodation and at about the same time purchased undeveloped land at Yellow
Rock (the Yellow Rock property) with the view to constructing a home on it. In the events that occurred they remained in that rented accommodation until
February 1993 when the rectification of Venture's work on the Yellow Rock property had been completed.

In anticipation of building a new home the Grimstons visited Home World in
December 1990 where they noticed a display caravan advertising "Collings Homes
Your Personal Builder". There they met J Collings who undertook to arrange for
Collings to contact them. She described Collings as her son who "will build you the home that you require". J Collings denied making this statement.
According to her evidence, she informed the Grimstons that Collings
Construction would not build a home for them, that it was not a builder and that it designed the home and referred the owners to "an independent Gold
Licensed Builder to build (their) home and sign a contract ....". I have little doubt that no such statement was made. The Grimstons evidenced a clear recollection of their conversation with J Collings and I accept their evidence. However, having regard to the age of J Collings and, what was evident from her evidence in cross-examination, her pride in what she perceived to be the achievements of Collings, I regard this statement as equivocal and of little value in evaluating the Commission's case against J
Collings.

On the occasion of this visit the Grimstons obtained pamphlets describing
Collings Homes as a builder with "35 years in building". The pamphlets were in the form earlier described in these reasons with the added notation that the advertised prices were subject to a reduction of $10,000 as appeared from the notation "SLASH $10,000 OFF Ask for Details". The material included the marketing guide. The Grimstons were deceived by these pamphlets into believing that the items in the schedule marked "INCLUDED" were, indeed, included in the price, overlooking the asterisk which qualified that inclusion.

In mid December 1990 the Grimstons met Richards and informed him of their budget limit of $90,000. They discussed the drawing up of a design by the
Grimstons based on one of the plans advertised by Collings Construction.
Several meetings of a like nature followed between December 1990 and March
During the course of these meetings the Grimstons produced such a plan and discussed the possibility of performing certain works themselves, such as the building of a verandah and painting, in order to bring the price within budget. Other matters discussed turned upon the fact that the Yellow Rock property was situated in an area that was not connected to town water or sewerage works. They discussed in some detail what was to be included in the contract price to be submitted by Collings Construction. After they had completed this exercise, they were requested by Collings to repeat the process on the basis that the association of Richards with Collings Construction had been terminated. In the course of these further discussions the Grimstons informed Collings of their budget limit of $90,000 with which Collings expressed his satisfaction. In relation to the advertised reduction of $10,000, Collings informed the Grimstons' that it "would be built into the quote". He also informed them that a builder's discount would be available although he could not state the amount "until (they) were ready to sign up".

Before reaching any agreement with Collings Construction, the Grimstons insisted on inspecting a Collings Construction home. This was arranged by
Collings. The first Collings Construction quotation was presented to the
Grimstons at a meeting with Collings on 6 April 1991. It was in the usual
Collings Construction form consisting of a quotation of $86,337 made up of a builder fee of $74,337 and the Collings Construction fee of $12,000, the schedule of work to be performed by Collings Construction and the summary which showed the break up of the so called contract price of $74,337 into a basic price of $69,697 to which were added five provisional sums. The summary included a number of provisional sum items against the majority of which no sum was allocated. In this latter group were the concrete foundation elements.
The Grimstons were also given the "SPECIAL CONDITIONS & REQUIREMENTS" document together with a work additionals schedule. These work additionals included the sum of $27,600 for the "Change to Owner's Plan extra area plus double garage". A variation in roof tiles and two items of credit gave a net additional amount of $20,600. Provision was made for a builder's discount but no sum had been allocated to it.

The varied report found that there was an unreasonable and excessive resort to provisional sum items and that, in the majority of instances, those items were capable of reasonable estimation and inclusion as part of a firm contract price. It was never satisfactorily explained by Collings why, in the case of the various owners quotations, the work additionals were not included in the calculation of a contract price. Although Venture used that structure of the quotation to obtain a deposit in excess of the amount permitted under the BSC
Act, I am not satisfied that Collings Construction had this in mind in structuring the quotation in that way. I am reasonably satisfied, however, that this device of a work additionals schedule was adopted by Collings
Construction to aid it in the creation of a deceptively competitive contract price which, in fact, was quite illusory having regard to the unreasonable resort to the mechanism of provisional sum items.

A measure of the inapplicability of the stated contract price for the subject works is reflected in the finding of the varied report that the cost of piers and other foundation elements along with "Landings and steps" (which were identified as a provisional sum item in the Collings Construction quotation but with no sum allocated to it) was capable of estimation and inclusion in the contract price in the amount of $7,840. Although Grimston acknowledged that he understood the nature of a provisional sum item, his evidence, which I accept, was that he had been informed by Collings that the sums allocated to provisional sum items were "the best estimates" and that the Grimstons would "most probably receive a refund". Cross-examined upon the Collings
Construction special condition 9 which provided that the provisional sums were "not an estimate of the cost" Grimston answered "Well, ... Collings told me they were" (T398.46, 394.41 and 401.49). In relation to the provisional sum items to which no sum had been allocated Collings gave Grimston the understanding that those items were not applicable to the subject works (cf
T400.55).

According to the evidence of Collings he carefully explained the nature of the quotation and in particular the limited role of Collings Construction as not extending to the performance of building works which would be in the hands of others. He also claimed to have explained in detail the rationale for this division of function and the provisional sum nature of the contract in relation to sub-surface works. I do not accept this evidence. It was the evidence of the Grimstons that in the initial months of their dealings with
Collings Construction they clearly understood from the Collings Construction advertisements and from what they had been told that Collings Construction was the builder of the proposed works and the Collings Construction quotation was so understood by them. While Grimston did not fully understand the term "independent franchise builders" he understood it to have the effect that
Collings Construction would employ the builder and would supervise the construction and that all payments would be made to Collings Construction. He regarded the $12,000 Collings Construction fee as related in some way to the internal workings of Collings Construction but that, in practical terms, it was part of the "total contract price of the builder, Collings Construction" (Exhibit AB par 53). In this understanding, Grimston was supported by statements by Collings of the continuing role that Collings Construction would have in performance of the proposed contract.

Agreement was reached between Collings Construction and the Grimstons at a meeting on 6 May 1991 at the office of Collings Construction. Between 6 April and 6 May 1991 there had been at least two meetings between Collings and the
Grimstons at one of which, on 20 April 1991, a further set of quotation documents bearing that date was presented to the Grimstons. The principal difference between the original quotation and that of 20 April was in the work additionals in which the item relating to the "Change to Owners Plan" was reduced from $27,600 to $22,600. That figure was further altered in the hand writing of Collings to $21,700. There was added to the schedule the sum of $3,437, again in the hand writing of Collings, representing the builder's discount and an additional cost of $900 was noted in Collings hand writing for "Collings administration". There appeared in Collings hand writing the total "$98,500". That figure represented the so called contract price of $74,337 plus the Collings Construction fee of $12,000 in addition to the items noted as extras on the amended work additionals schedule less the credits there shown.

The figure "$98,500" appeared elsewhere on the work additionals schedule together with the figure "$12,600" and a balance figure "$85,900". According to the evidence of S Grimston those figures were in the hand writing of
Grimston and were probably noted by him at the meeting, on 6 May 1991. The evidence of Grimston is that these figures were noted by him at a much later time. The significance of this evidence of S Grimston is that, if the notes were made by Grimston at the meeting of 6 May 1991, it is reasonably clear that Grimston well understood, prior into entering into any agreement with
Collings Construction, that the figure of $74,337 described as the contract price in Collings Construction summary quotation was required to be adjusted by the net effect of the work additionals. It was the evidence of Grimston that at the time of his entry into contractual arrangements with Collings
Construction and Venture he understood that the work additionals schedule of items were included in the contract price of $74,337. He was cross-examined at length on this evidence (see T407 - 413 and 423 - 427, 434). I regard that evidence of Grinston as unsatisfactory. It is inconsistent with extensive negotiations on particular items including items in the work additionals schedule without any adjustment to the figure stated as the contract price in the quotation summary. The work additional schedule items were the subject of quite significant variation during the course of negotiations. Yet, throughout, the figure of $74,337 remained constant. This simply does not make sense. I think the evidence of S Grimston is to be accepted and that prior to his accepting the Collings Construction quotation, Grimston understood that the figure described as the contract price was subject to adjustment by the net effect of the work additional schedule items.

There was another area where S Grimston's evidence was at variance with that of Grimston, namely, in her acceptance in cross-examination that, during the course of negotiations with Collings, the latter made mention of the protection afforded by insurance under the BSC Act. However, I do not regard that as a matter of any significance.

The added item of $900 for "Collings Administration" was the subject of discussion at the meeting of 6 May in which Collings attempted to justify it on the basis that there was an additional charge of $1,800 "due for the change of plans, of which $900 was to be paid to Collings (Construction) with $900 to be billed by the builder later" (Exhibit AB par 72). This charge is quite remarkable, given the fee of $12,000 sought to be imposed by Collings
Construction for design work. The Commission led evidence as to the reasonable fee for the design work performed by Collings Construction in relation to the various owners' plans. In the case of the Grimston's design work the evidence was that a reasonable fee, including expenses, would be $2,154. This challenge to the Collings Construction design fee is examined in more detail later in these reasons. For present purposes it is sufficient to observe that, given the magnitude of the proposed fee of $12,000, there could be no justification for the imposition of an additional fee of $1,800 as required by Collings
Construction in its amended quotation.

In reaching agreement with Collings on 6 May 1991 Grimston executed a BC3 contract which was described by Collings as a standard form of contract. It had already been executed by Kioussis. It is not clear whether the form of contract executed by Grimston contained any special conditions or annexures.
It was either at this meeting, or one of the prior meetings between Grimston and Collings, that Collings informed Grimston that Venture would be the builder. Collings described Kioussis as having been in building "for a long time". According to Grimston Collings went on to say that `Kioussis had experienced some financial worries, particularly when Collings Construction stopped using him as a builder (and that he) had some financial problems with
Telecom but those problems would not recur'. Collings denied making such a statement to Grimston at that time and asserted that it was not until February or March of 1992 that he had any information concerning any financial difficulties that Venture may have had with Telecom. In this Collings had some slight corroboration. Collings agreed that there was a time, prior to his dealings with the owners, when he had ceased using Venture, but that the decision to do so, he asserted, was the result of difficulties Collings was experiencing with the personality of Kioussis and was unrelated to any possible financial problems affecting Venture. I am not satisfied that
Collings made the statements concerning Kioussis and Telecom at the time stated by Grimston.

I think, however, that a far more serious imputation should be made concerning
Collings recommendation of Venture to the Grimstons: namely, that at the time of so referring the Grimstons, Collings must have been aware of the commercial untrustworthiness of Venture and of its willingness to exploit the owners through the contractual structure created by Collings Construction. In my opinion that fixes Collings with knowledge of Venture's nature and conduct and places him in the position of a knowing and willing party to Venture's contraventions.

I accept the evidence of Grimston that Collings nominated Venture as the builder and provided the building licence number of Venture. This enabled
Grimston to obtain confirmation from the Corporation that Venture held such a licence and that nothing adverse to Venture was known by the Corporation. In the course of that enquiry Grimston was also informed that Collings
Construction held no such licence. It was the evidence of the Grimstons that, while initially they understood Collings Construction would be the builder, when it was ascertained that another organisation would be carrying out the building work, they both understood that this would be under the control of
Collings Construction which would retain a supervisory role in the performance of the works (see T389.45, 391.36, 392.25, 399.36 and 406.40, 442.55, 443, 445 - 446, 451.5 - 452).

For the most part S Grimston left the decisions to Grimston and relied on his guidance in entering into the subject arrangements with Collings Construction and Venture.

On the occasion of the meeting of 6 May 1991, at the request of Collings,
Grimston paid a sum of $3,000 as a first instalment of the Collings
Construction fee.

It is difficult to reconcile the evidence of the Grimstons as to their budget limit of $90,000 with the evidence of S Grimston that, on reaching agreement with Collings Construction, Grimston had noted the Collings Construction quotation as being in total $98,500. S Grimston sought to explain the apparent inconsistency as follows: "We were told we would have builder's discount. We were told that we would be able to reduce that price by painting, by cleaning, by supplying and fitting our own vanities and kitchen and I knew that that $98,500 was not our final figure." (T449.41) 
The difficulty with this explanation is that the builder's discount had been taken into account in calculating the figure of $98,500 and that the cost of the kitchen fitting, whether they were to be supplied pursuant to the arrangement with Collings Construction or by some third party, would still be a cost in the construction of the works. I accept that the Grimstons had on a number of occasions stipulated to Collings that the budget limit was $90,000 and I have come to the conclusion that, notwithstanding that limit, they were prepared to accept the Collings Construction quotation in the belief that the cost could be reduced by the performance of various works by the Grimstons.
Whatever be the truth of that matter, it has little bearing, in my opinion, on the conclusions which I have reached as to the nature of the conduct of
Collings Construction and of the deception of the Grimstons by that conduct.
In the weeks that followed there was a delay in the progress of the project for reasons which caused Collings to apologise to the Grimstons for the delay.
When plans were produced to Grimston that were said to be in a form appropriate for submission to council, Grimston found that they contained errors which Collings undertook to correct. On 24 June 1991 Collings requested
Grimston to make a second instalment payment of $3,000 as he claimed that the building application was about to be submitted to council for its approval.
This payment was made on 25 June 1991. Several weeks passed without any apparent progress in the matter and it was not until 16 September 1991 that
Council notified of its development approval. On that date Grimston paid the final instalment of $6,900 to Collings Construction for its fee.

The conduct of Collings Construction in dealing with the Grimstons, in substance, was indistinguishable from its deceptive conduct in relation to the other owners. I think it is quite clear from the evidence that, had the
Grimstons been aware of the unrealistic nature of the contract price as a purported firm price for the construction of the subject works and that
Collings Construction would take no part in the supervision of the performance of the works or that the contract price as quoted was inadequate to permit the builder of the works to recover its costs and any margin by way of profit, they would not have entered into any arrangement with Collings Construction. I think it is clear that they did so by reason of the misleading and deceptive nature of that conduct of Collings Construction. I am further of the opinion that Collings had been put on notice by April - May 1991 that Venture was abrogating the arrangements reached between Collings Construction and the owners with the view to striking its own bargain with owners who were materially disadvantaged at the time by reason of their commitment to the project through their payment of non-refundable deposits to Collings
Construction. I am satisfied that Collings Construction was well aware of this conduct of Venture.

It was not until 14 October 1991 that an appointment was made for the
Grimstons to meet Kioussis. Due to the illness of one of their children, S
Grimston was not able to attend. At this meeting Kioussis presented to
Grimston his business card with the false university qualification on it and the certificate on his office wall identified as a building degree which he had obtained. He told Grimston that he was a member of the MBA and of the
Australian Institute of Building. He claimed to have performed a number of government contracts. At this meeting Kioussis produced a new set of contract documents for execution by Grimston on the excuse that the earlier documentation executed by Grimston was "out of date" so that it was necessary to "sign a new one to make it valid": that the first contract was "an `Intent to Build' ... and (had) run out of time". There was only a glimmer of truth in those representations and that element of truth had nothing to do with Venture wishing to induce the Grimstons to execute fresh contracts.

The Venture contract documents contained several additional provisional sum items, variation provisions and other contractual provisions which were not to be found in the Collings Construction documents. The varied report found that the Venture contract contained unwarranted recourse to provisional sum items most of which should have been priced and included in the contract sum.

Some pressure was brought to bear on Grimston to sign the contract with
Kioussis asserting that he could be trusted, that he had "done this hundreds of times" and that there weren't any problems. The documents included the BC3 contract with amendments which were referred to by Kioussis. He also produced the plain english document which he passed off as simply being a clearer explanation of the BC3 contract. During the course of this meeting Kioussis purported to dictate minutes. In all the meeting lasted about one and a half hours. Among the documents produced was the usual Venture letter holding out that Venture was an organisation with outstanding qualifications. The BC3 contract executed by Grimston incorporated the Collings Construction quotation of 6 April 1991 which, particularly in the case of the work additionals, had been superseded. The incorporated documents included the marketing guide and the plain english document. In signing the contract Grimston did not realise that the annexures related to the superseded quotation by Collings
Construction. He did not realise this until sometime in 1992. A document purporting to be minutes of this meeting was later sent to Grimston by
Venture. Grimston noticed that these minutes described a number of items as variations which had been agreed to be provided by Collings Construction as part of its contract price. Apart from some isolated items Grimston does not appear to have challenged Kioussis over the accuracy of the minutes.

At the request of Kioussis, S Grimston executed the subject contract shortly after the 14 October meeting. On 24 October 1991 Venture made a demand for payment of $24,316 made up of what was described as a 5 per cent deposit of $3,716 and work additionals of some $20,600. Grimston's evidence was that he did not realise at that time that the demand for the work additionals sum was based upon the superseded quotation of Collings Construction of 6 April 1991.
In any event, on advice, he limited payment to the 5 per cent deposit which was paid on 7 November 1991.

Soon after the commencement of works came the usual pattern of variation claims by Venture. When Grimston called on Collings demanding an explanation for a variation claim for bricks, the only satisfaction he received was a statement by Collings that the Grimstons were obliged to pay "because its in the contract". Collings claimed to have explained that matter to the
Grimstons at the time of their arrangement with Collings Construction but this
Grimston denied and accused Collings of not being "honest in (his) dealings".

When, by early February Grimston had not paid the amount of work additionals demanded by Venture, he received a phone call from Kioussis in which Kioussis shouted at him that he would "see (Grimston) in arbitration". Later that month there was the usual demand by Venture of payment for the cost of a survey as a variation. Once again Grimston complained to Collings who sought to justify the Venture variation as involving a survey different from that for which
Collings Construction had been responsible.

At the end of February 1992 Venture submitted a claim for the first progress claim and the survey variation in the sum of $18,894. This was paid by the
Grimstons making their total payment to Venture $22,920. That was the last payment made by them. In March 1992 Venture continued to press for the payment of the superseded work additionals amount. It was about this time that publicity concerning the conduct of Venture and Collings Construction was first broadcast on television in a production known as "The Investigators", a programme devoted to the exposure of improper commercial conduct. When the programme came to the attention of the Grimstons they confronted Collings who denied any impropriety and attributed the publicity to problems created by
Kioussis. He suggested Beresford as a possible consultant to inspect the
Grimstons' incompleted works. Shortly after this Grimston confronted Kioussis and informed him that they did not want any further involvement with Venture.
While Kioussis expressed acquiescence in that course, he denied any of the impropriety attributed to him in the television programme. On 16 March 1992
Venture submitted a further demand for the payment of the work additionals and threatened arbitration if the sum was not paid.

The Grimstons arranged for Beresford to inspect the site in mid March 1992 following which he reported to the Grimstons on 20 March 1992. Relations between Grimston and Kioussis deteriorated further when, at a meeting at
Venture's Bankstown office on 20 March 1992, there was a heated discussion concerning unsatisfactory workmanship in the Grimstons' building works. During this discussion Kioussis was absurdly arrogant, stating that he could put anything in the Grimstons' house that he wished and that they must accept it, "even hessian walls". Grimston's response was to instruct Kioussis to immediately cease work on the project. The response of Kioussis was to threaten arbitration at this meeting. Grimston offered to pay $12,000 to "buy out of the contract". The threats of litigation to enforce payment of unfounded claims have the same character of harassment as Venture's conduct towards other owners.

The proposal to make a payment to Venture in relation to the cessation of work under the contract was referred to the solicitors for the Grimstons for the preparation of appropriate documentation. At this stage the Grimstons did not have a complete copy of either of the documents they had signed with Collings
Construction or Venture.

By notice dated 29 April 1992 Venture gave notice of dispute with a view to referring the matter to arbitration. This notice was received in early May, about the same time as Grimstons' solicitor had prepared a deed to release the
Grimstons from further claims by Venture. Before the deed was executed the
Grimstons joined the Misadventure Club. On joining this group the Grimstons instructed Russo to act on their behalf and, as a result of this change in legal representation, they proceeded no further with the deed.

Beresford made a further inspection of the subject works on 2 June 1992 and reported on it to the Grimstons. In mid June the Grimstons referred their complaints against Venture to the Corporation. The only activity from Venture in this period was a request by it to the MBA for the appointment of an arbitrator.

In mid July the Grimstons received a series of variation claims from Venture.
These were simply forwarded on to Russo and Beresford by the Grimstons. They appear to bear similar characteristics to the variation claims made on other owners by Venture.

Early in August the Grimstons received an amended notice of dispute dated 29
July 1992. A preliminary hearing in the subject arbitration was held on 20
August 1992. The arbitrator was informed by Russo's letter of 26 August 1992 that the contract had been determined.

The year closed with a caveat being lodged by Venture on the Yellow Rock property. The caveat lapsed in February 1993. I regard the arbitration proceedings by Venture and its lodgment of a caveat on the Grimstons property as part of its pattern of harassment in which Venture engaged in endeavouring to enforce payment by the owners.

I regard the conduct of Venture and Kioussis in their dealings with the
Grimstons as indistinguishable, in principle, from their dealings with the other owners and that it had the intended effect of inducing the Grimstons to enter into contractual relations with Venture. There is no doubt that
Venture's conduct resulted in substantial damage being suffered by the
Grimstons. I have no doubt that had the Grimstons any inkling of the true nature of the organisation they had been referred to by Collings
Constructions, or of the incompetence of that organisation, or of its creed of commercial dishonesty they would not have entered into any arrangement with
Venture nor permitted it or its representatives on to the Yellow Rock property. The claim for damages on behalf of the Grimstons has been summarised by the Commission as follows: "1.

The Tantis and the Ferrises each came into contact with Collings Construction in February 1991 with the Ferrises entering into contractual arrangements with
Venture in July of that year, and in the case of the Tantis, September 1991.
The Ferrises 
The Ferrises were open in their responses in cross-examination, their answers being given without hesitation and, in my opinion, without an eye on the implications of that evidence. They showed no sign of evasion. Ferris was reserved and I considered him to be frank in the giving of his evidence. I regarded the evidence of both the Ferrises as reliable and their denials of matters put to them in cross-examination and their affirming of evidence in chief convincing. The treatment of the Ferrises was no less shameful than that experienced by the owners so far considered in these reasons. The varied report estimated the reasonable contract price for the subject works to be between $131,450 and $133,650 as against the Collings Construction quotation of $105,566. The varied report further found that the state of the works as constructed by Venture was such as to reasonably require demolition.

In January 1991 the Ferrises lived in rented premises in Wahroonga and owned an undeveloped block of land at Westleigh (the Westleigh property). Initial enquiries from their lending bank indicated that they would have available, approximately, $120,000 to build a residence at the Westleigh property. After visiting Home World, where they noticed homes advertised by Collings Homes on January 1991, the Ferrises obtained some brochures and the marketing guide from the Collings Construction location at Home World. On 25 February 1991
Ferris had a telephone conversation with Collings in which an appointment was made for them to meet the following day at Home World.

The Collings Homes brochure was in the usual form, as was the marketing guide, with the schedule of items included in the listed prices set out on the back sheet. From the outset the Ferrises understood Collings Construction to be the builder of the residence under discussion. At the meeting of 26 February 1991
Collings described Collings Construction as being a family business that had been building homes for thirty years. There were further meetings into March at which plans were produced by Collings Construction which purported to reflect the requirements of the Ferrises but which were not acceptable to the
Ferrises. This led to the Ferrises seeking comparative prices from other project advertisers. On a further visit to Home World one of the plans displayed by Collings Construction attracted the Ferrises' attention as did a sign indicating that the advertised prices were subject to a discount of $10,000. Following a contact from Collings on 19 March 1991, the Ferrises attended at the office of Collings Construction on 20 March where, by reference to a project home design the Ferrises discussed with Collings their requirements. At this meeting, Collings gave an indicative price of $110,000, at the same time expressing the belief that that price could be significantly reduced. When asked by Ferris how he kept his costs "so low" Collings explained that it was because his "company operates on 2.5 per cent of the contract price". At this meeting Collings endeavoured to commit the Ferrises to some contractual arrangement on the undertaking that he would then disclose the discount available on Collings Construction's current pricing. The
Ferrises declined that invitation.

In subsequent telephone conversations between Collings and the Ferrises other requirements of the Ferrises were discussed. This led a meeting on 25 March between Collings and the Ferrises at Home World at which further plans were produced by Collings. The Ferrises found these plans to be unsatisfactory in some respects. The price for the building under discussion was stated by
Collings to be approximately $117,000, before allowing for any discount. There was some further pressure from Collings to obtain a deposit in the sum of $3,000. The Ferrises resisted this on the basis that the Collings Construction proposal was not sufficiently settled. Following this meeting Collings
Construction undertook some further plan preparation in which process the
Ferrises took some part.

It is not clear just when Collings Construction and the Ferrises reached agreement on the Collings Construction proposal. It appears that at a meeting or meetings at the end of March 1991 a proposal was submitted to the Ferrises by Collings Construction in the usual documentary form bearing date 25 March
At this meeting the Ferrises were informed by Collings that there were two franchise builders available from which he had "chosen the better of the two" and whom he described as a "well qualified builder .... who has a Degree in Building". As to the performance of the works, Collings assured the
Ferrises that he would continue to be involved. The evidence of Collings and that of Frank Cozzupoli (Cozzupoli) differs from the evidence of the Ferrises concerning the role of Collings Construction under the proposed arrangement.
Cozzupoli was employed at that time by Collings Construction as a "sales design manager". He claimed to have overheard conversations between Collings and the Ferrises. According to the version of Collings, the contractual role of Collings Construction was clearly explained, in detail, to the Ferrises.
Cozzupoli corroborated this, but not in such detail. The Ferrises were each subjected to extensive cross-examination concerning this role of Collings
Construction and their understanding of it and I have been left in no doubt at all that the distinction between the roles of Collings Construction and the builder was not defined as Collings and Cozzupoli assert. During somewhat extensive cross-examination Ferris maintained that he always understood that with the introduction of a builder that organisation would be under the control of Collings Construction in the nature of a sub-contract (T181.10, .11, 183.20, 196.28, 216.24 and 231.35). Similarly, D Ferris was equally convincing in her evidence. She was unshaken in her evidence of her understanding that "as far as (she) knew (Collings Construction) was going to build (her) house .... We always thought that (Collings Construction) was the builder. We were never given any reason to think otherwise ...." (T250.44).
According to D Ferris, Collings referred to the builder to be introduced to the Ferrises to be "One of my builders" (T251.5). It was also her evidence that: "We understood that it was one of his builders, and Wayne was going to oversee it, and he told us he would." 
When being questioned about a discussion as to what Collings "would be doing and what the builder would be doing" D Ferris responded "they were one and the same". D Ferris associated the statements of Collings with the written material published by Collings Construction as appears from the following evidence in cross-examination: "Q. You spoke about you having your own personal builder to build the home for you? 
A. Well, he told us that he had good builders and his marketing was "Your personal builder, Collings Homes".

Q. Disregard the brochure for a moment. Just think about what he said to you face-to-face. Did he talk about having good builders? 
A. Yes, he did, but I find it hard to disassociate the brochure, because Wayne relied heavily on his brochure, and his marketing was "Your personal builder", "family company" et cetera. " (T254.39 - .50) 
While Cozzupoli gave evidence in a plausible way and showed that he did not lack intelligence I gained the impression that he did not lack interest in the subject matter. In any event, I was left in little doubt that the Ferrises' understanding was genuinely held by them and was the result of the conduct of
Collings Construction and of Collings in the discussions had with the Ferrises and of the advertising material put out by Collings Construction.

The quotation documentation dated 25 March 1991 was understood by the Ferrises to be an offer of a realistic firm contract price subject only to one matter which requires particular attention, namely, the possible cost of certain sub- surface works. The quotation, the work additionals, the summary and the schedule of work to be performed by Collings Construction together with the special conditions and requirements document were all in the usual form. The costs of the proposed home was stated to be $107,466 consisting of the builder fee of $95,466 and the Collings construction fee of $12,000. The summary identified the basic price as being $89,186 which when added to five provisional sums made up the "Contract Price of $95,466". This summary contained numerous other provisional sum items to which no amount had been allocated. The items for "Excavation and Site Preparation in Soil" had the provisional sum of $900 allocated to it. The varied report as adopted found that the majority of the items described as provisional sum items were capable of estimation by a reasonable builder and of inclusion in a firm contract price. The work additionals as presented initially at that meeting reflected an additional net increase of $6,000. Further discussion concerning other works led to some adjustment to the work additionals which involved an additional $4,100. So adjusted the contract price and the Collings
Construction fee totalled $117,566.

During the course of this meeting the Ferrises impressed on Collings the need to have a firm price and the fact that the Ferrises were working within a strict budget. It was also emphasised to him that time was important to the
Ferrises as they were dependent upon bank finance to meet the cost of constructing the proposed building and were currently exposed to the payment of rent of the premises which they occupied. Although I have no doubt that these matters were emphasised to Collings it does not appear from the evidence in chief of the Ferrises that the budget limit of the Ferrises was disclosed to Collings. During the course of his oral evidence Ferris identified that budget limit as approximately $121,000 (T189.1). It was at about this time that the first payment of a deposit in the sum of $3,000 was made by Ferris.
The receipt for this payment, referred to as a "Progress Payment Non
Refundable", was dated 8 April 1991. The receipt was on Collings Construction letterhead in which it was described as "MASTER BUILDERS & CONTRACTORS".

I have been left in no doubt that the structure of its quotation by Collings
Construction was a deliberate attempt to present the contract price as a firm fixed price which was highly competitive, whereas such a price was significantly below the price which would enable a builder to recover the cost of construction and derive any profit from that work. Moreover, by excessive and unreasonable resort to the mechanism of provisional sum items, Collings
Construction structured the quotation in a way which would enable a builder to take advantage of that structure to obtain increases to the contract price during the performance of the works. I am further of the opinion that, at the time this quotation was submitted to the Ferrises, Collings had reason to believe that Venture was aware of such features of Collings Construction's quotations and was prepared to exploit them: that Collings was aware of the untrustworthiness of Venture. I think the fact that Collings Construction failed to take an active part in the finalisation of contractual arrangements between the Ferrises and Venture precludes it from absolving itself from responsibility for the fact that Venture, in its dealings with the Ferrises, chose to regard itself as not bound by the agreement, such as it was, which had been reached between the Ferrises and Collings Construction. I am further of the opinion that, at the time the Ferrises entered into contractual relations with Venture, Collings had very good reason to believe that Venture was disposed to act in that way. Collings' evidence, supported to some extent by Cozzupoli, to the effect that the details of the contractual structure were carefully and fully explained by him to the Ferrises is, in my opinion, not plausible and I reject it as being an unreliable description of his dealings with the Ferrises.

After some further communication between the Ferrises and Collings, an appointment was made to meet on 8 May 1991 when a further cheque for $3,000 was extracted from the Ferrises by Collings and a receipt was given on the same letterhead as was provided for the payment of the first instalment. At this meeting the Ferrises noticed that Collings Construction had made changes to the earlier plans which had not been the subject of prior discussion. When
Collings stated that the changes, which included alteration to the roof configuration and the lowering of the level of the garage, would not involve any extra cost, the Ferrises accepted those changes. At this meeting Collings obtained the signature of the Ferrises to the usual copyright form of agreement and to a BC3 contract which he described simply as a "Standard
Contract Form that builders use". At the end of June the Ferrises were informed by Collings that council approval of the plans had been obtained and in early July a further meeting was arranged with the Ferrises at which
Collings requested a further payment of $8,129. This was $2,129 more than the agreed Collings Construction fee. This change was explained by Collings in the following terms: "This was arranged between Harry ... and myself. Its an agreement between the builder and myself that for houses over $100,000 my percentage fee increases accordingly." 
Collings assured Ferris that the overall price would not change.

It appears from the structuring of the contract price by Collings Construction that the promised builder's discount failed to eventuate.

There followed a meeting with Kioussis and the Ferrises at the office of
Venture on 12 July 1991. The Ferrises were introduced by Kioussis to P
Kioussis as the person who would be supervising the site works.

I have no doubt that the deceptive conduct of Collings Construction, in holding itself out as a builder and in structuring its quotation to present an illusory competitive firm contract price which, far from being competitive, unrealistically underpriced the works, induced the Ferrises to enter into their arrangement with Collings Construction and to make the payments to which
I have referred. I have been left in no doubt that, but for those matters, the
Ferrises would not have made such payments nor would they have continued to deal with Collings Construction. Except in respect of one matter, I am satisfied that the Ferrises were deceived into thinking that the Collings
Construction quotation was a fixed contract price.

The qualification lies in the sub-surface works required on site. I found the evidence of Ferris on this subject matter both confusing and inconsistent in some respects with the evidence of D Ferris. Despite the evidence of Ferris that there was no outcrop of rock on the Westleigh property I am satisfied from the evidence of D Ferris that the presence of rock was visible on the surface and that there was a likely cost of excavation in rock to be taken into account. As I understand the evidence of Ferris, he regarded that work as covered by the provisional sum item for excavation of $900. However, this is inconsistent with his acceptance in cross-examination that it was "feasible" that he had said to Collings sometime in March of 1992 that he had known that he had "to pay for the extra concrete and piers and rock" and that he had set aside $7,000 to cover that cost (T199.15). While I think Ferris was confused in this evidence, I am satisfied from his evidence in chief and in cross- examination and from the evidence of D Ferris that, apart from the provisional sum allowance of $900 for excavation, Ferris understood that there was likely to be additional costs of sub-surface works having regard to the known presence of rock on the site.

At the 12 July 1991 meeting between Kioussis and the Ferrises, Kioussis described himself as having a degree from the University of New South Wales and as having done "one year of Law" - neither of which was true. He held out that Venture was a reputable and a competent organisation - neither of which was true and he set about dismantling elements of the agreement which had been reached between the Ferrises and Collings Construction. He was informed of the budget limit of $120,000. Kioussis had with him contract documents including the work additionals schedule which, according to the evidence in chief of
Ferris, was the superseded schedule. In this Ferris was mistaken. I doubt if any significance lies in this confusion.

Discussion centred upon architectural drawings produced by Kioussis which had been signed by the Ferrises at the request of Collings Construction,. Kioussis maintained that the change in the configuration of the roof would be a variation and rejected the Ferrises statement that it had been agreed with
Collings that the change would not give rise to a variation claim. The response of Kioussis was as follows: "Yes, this is something between you and Wayne Collings. I can't build the house with that roof for that price." 
He also maintained that it would be necessary to have sarking installed in the roof which would also be a variation. According to Kioussis, the Ferrises requirements for doors and wardrobes would constitute a variation to the
Collings Construction price. When discussing the level of the garage floor
Kioussis claimed that steps would be required which would also be a variation.
When the Ferrises complained that this had not been raised by Collings the response of Kioussis was: "Wayne Collings is not the builder, I am the builder. Wayne Collings also misses a lot of things." 
Out of this discussion came the preparation by Venture of a work additionals schedule dated 25 March 1991. According to that works schedule there were a number of items of extra work which totalled $16,400 and a number of credits, mainly in relation to work or materials to be done or supplied by the
Ferrises, which items totalled $11,480 in value. This meant that there had to be added to the so called contract price the sum of $4,920. There may have been a further item of $400 representing the value of taps to be supplied by the Ferrises, but this item does not appear to have been included in the work additionals schedule prepared by Venture.

Kioussis required other changes to be made to the arrangements made by the
Ferrises with Collings Construction which called for further variations to the stated contract price, such as layout changes shown on the architectural drawings. Kioussis refused to quantify a number of the variations foreshadowed by him.

After the meeting had been in progress nearly three hours, the meeting had begun at 5:00 pm, Kioussis produced a form of building contract which he required the Ferrises to execute. Before they did so the following conversation took place: "Kioussis said: "You will be familiar with this contract. It is a standard
BC-3 Contract issued by the MBA of which I am a Member. Please read it." 
I said: "I did not think that I would have to sign another document." 
He said: "Why not Mr Ferris?" 
I said: "Because we have already signed a contract with Wayne Collings." 
He said: "I don't know anything about that. Wayne Collings is not building your house, I am." 
I said: "It is getting late." 
He said: "You are in a hurry to start this house and so am I and you have already had a number of delays, so it is better if we get this signed tonight." " (Exhibit H, par 93) 
As a result of this description, Ferris understood the document to be "the contract normally used in the building industry in New South Wales for the construction of dwelling houses" and did not require his particular attention.
He did not raise the question of the reduction of the contract price by the excess payment made to Collings Construction as had been arranged with
Collings. The BC3 contract incorporated the Collings Construction documents and the plain english document. Kioussis stated that the plain english document explained how the progress payments were to be made. When Ferris remonstrated that it provided for a different method of payment, the response of Kioussis was "you are dealing with me now".

Of the illegal provision for the payment of work additionals together with the per cent deposit prior to the commencement of work, Kioussis sought to justify that provision on the basis that Venture had "to be able to go on with the building and to be able to buy the material .... we have to get the money from somewhere". Ferris felt in no position to make any demands upon Kioussis, feeling compromised by the fact that he had paid an irrefundable deposit of $14,129 to Collings Construction. With the reservation that I have expressed earlier concerning the cost of sub-surface elements, I accept the evidence of
Ferris that he believed that all likely variations had been "tied up" in the discussions with Collings and Kioussis and that provisional sum items, where no sum had been allocated to them, were covered in the contract price. In obtaining the signature of the Ferrises to the plain english document,
Kioussis described it as "the plain English version of the contract".

Although Ferris was disconcerted by the renegotiation that took place with
Kioussis, the only satisfaction he got from the latter was the statement: "You are not dealing with Wayne Collings, you are dealing with me now." 
None of the events which involved the signing of a contract with Venture caused the Ferrises to depart from their understanding that the arrangement they had with Collings would ensure that Collings Construction would oversee and control the performance of the works.

It appears that, added to Venture's pressure to sign the contract documents produced by Kioussis, the Ferrises are Seventh Day Adventists whose Sabbath begins on sunset Friday night after which, until sunset Saturday night business matters are avoided. The meeting with Kioussis was held on a Friday evening and continued well after sunset.

Venture provided the Ferrises with Venture's introductory letter in the usual form. In all other respects the contract documentation which the Ferrises signed followed the form of documentation which Kioussis had submitted to the other owners during 1991.

There is no doubt that, had the Ferrises been aware of the incompetence and dishonest nature of the Venture organisation, or been aware of the illusory nature of the fixed price contract executed by them with Venture, or been aware of the fraudulent representations of Kioussis, they would not have entertained any thought of entering into any contractual or other arrangement with Venture of with those associated with Venture.

The contract so executed contained a number of additional variation provisions several additional provisional sum items and several additional contractual provisions for Venture's benefit which did not appear in the Collings
Construction documents. The varied report found that the resort to provisional sum items was, for the most part, unwarranted.

Following the meeting of 12 July, Venture forwarded what purported to be minutes of that meeting by letter of 28 July 1991, a copy of which was sent to
Collings. Ferris took issue with a number of the items which were described as variations in those minutes. Ferris had a telephone conversation with Kioussis concerning that matter and in particular the variation in relation to roof tiles, doors to be supplied and plan changes. He obtained no satisfaction from
Kioussis and when asked by Ferris: "Why haven't I been told about this? I have already paid Wayne Collings" 
Kioussis replied: "Collings doesn't know what he's talking about" 
Discussions concerning the roof variation took place over a period of months in telephone conversation between Ferris on the one hand and Collings and
Kioussis. The attitude of Collings was that if Venture could justify the additional cost that Ferris should pay it. On 17 August 1991 Ferris received the first claim from Venture in the sum of $9,693 which was an illegal claim for a deposit in excess of 5 per cent of the contract sum.

Largely as a result of the concessions made on behalf of Venture as to the sub-standard nature of its performance of its contract with the Ferrises, the evidence of progress and of the particular defective nature of the work was scant. In broad terms it appears that work was spasmodic and called for frequent enquiries as to progress by Ferris. By the end of the year the
Ferrises had received variation claims in excess of $20,000 and were unable to contact either Kioussis or P Kioussis who, presumably, were absent on an extended holiday. It was at about this time that the Ferrises considered they needed the services of a consultant and retained Beresford from whom they received a report at the end of January 1992 which the Ferrises delivered to
Venture. At the same time they lodged a complaint with the Corporation concerning the performance of the works by Venture.

During February D Ferris received a number of telephone calls from Collings who wanted to make some arrangement with the Ferrises "against Harry
Kioussis". On 21 February 1992 a meeting took place on site between a member of the Corporation, Beresford, Collings, Kioussis, P Kioussis and another employee of Venture and the Ferrises. Throughout this time Venture persisted in claims for the payment of alleged variations. Over the preceding months there had been a number of exchanges between the Ferrises, Collings and
Kioussis over the claim for the additional cost of the roof which resulted in
Collings Construction paying the disputed amount to the Ferrises by cheque in favour of Venture in the sum of $6,500. There were some acrimonious exchanges with Kioussis in March and on 1 April 1992, there was a further site inspection by a representative of the Corporation, Collings, Beresford, the
Ferrises and a member of the Venture organisation. On 10 December 1992 the
Ferrises received notification of a lodgment of a caveat on the Westleigh property. The evidence of the Ferrises is that the conduct of the Venture group placed a severe strain upon them and resulted in frequent migraine attacks being experienced by D Ferris which required medication, occasionally in the form of some twelve tablets of analgesics a day. She suffered fits of depression breaking down and crying for no apparent reason. Ferris also suffered similar deterioration in his health with the stress occasioned by his experience in dealing with the Venture group.

By notice dated 25 February 1992 Venture resorted to arbitration as he had done with other owners.

I have no doubt that the conduct of Venture in bringing arbitration proceedings and in lodging a caveat on the title to the Westleigh property was part of a pattern of harassment of the owners which Venture resorted to in an attempt to subdue the owners' criticism of Venture's conduct and to force payment of its unwarranted demands.

The state of the works in March 1992 I think can be extracted from the following telephone conversation between Ferris and P Kioussis which took place on 2 March 1992: "On or about 2 March 1992 I telephoned Penny Kioussis seeking an explanation as to why progress had ceased.

She said: "There won't be any progress until the variations are paid." "We're having trouble getting tradesmen on the job" 
I said: "Do you have the client's interests at heart?" 
She said: "We look after the ones that matter." 
I said: "When's the work going to resume?" 
She said: "When the BSC has made the inspection." 
I said: "Well Penny if the work starts again will it resume at the rate of one day a week as was the case last year?" 
She said: "If necessary that will be the case." 
The conversation then lapsed into a heated argument. About 10 minutes later
Penny Kioussis then telephoned me and apologised.

She said: "I'm sorry Ashleigh. We've had people calling all day from the
Investigators." 
Later that day Penny Kioussis telephoned me and said that Chris Andrews would hand deliver the invoices for the variations in dispute." " (Exhibit H, par 211) 
The reference to Chris Andrews is to an employee of Venture. By this time publicity was being generated through television programmes concerning the conduct of Collings Construction and Venture. I have little doubt that this publicity explains, in part, the belated efforts of Collings Construction to intervene in the dispute eg. by payment of the disputed roof variation.

By letter dated 24 March 1992 the Ferrises were informed by the MBA of the appointment of an arbitrator in their dispute with Venture.

On 5 April 1992 the Ferrises notified the Corporation of their intention to make a claim under the Corporation insurance scheme.

From the varied report it will be seen that while it was possible to retain the benefit of certain site works and to repair the slab constructed by
Venture on the Westleigh property, the remainder of the work performed by
Venture required demolition and rebuilding. I have found nothing of significance in the conduct of Collings Construction and of Venture towards the Ferrises to distinguish it from their conduct towards the other owners so far as it constituted contraventions under the Act.

The damages as claimed on behalf of the Ferrises has been summarised by the
Commission as follows:

The Tantis 
Tanti as a witness presented as an uncomplicated person, direct and frank in his answers with no indication of prevarication or hesitation in giving those answers. In cross-examination he was positive in his denial of matters and I had no reason to doubt his honesty or reliability: similarly in the case of W
Tanti. Her evidence in cross-examination was given naturally and, I thought, with frankness. She was prepared to accept some matters and, in other instances, freely acknowledged that she could not recall "the facts". However, for the most part the cross-examination of W Tanti revealed that her recollection of events was not detailed and it was quite clear that she had left the negotiation of the contract with Collings Construction and Venture to
Tanti (T135.35, 152.11, 156.15, 157.44 and 158.15).

The Tantis fared no better than any of the other owners in that it was found by the varied report that complete demolition of the work performed by Venture was required as a result of its defective state. This included demolition of sub-surface works. It was found that the total cost of demolition and rebuilding was $152,843. The varied report also found that the reasonable contract price for the Tantis' home would have been between $116,800 to $119,400 depending on finish in the case of the Collings Construction documentation or between $137,680 and $140,263, again depending upon finish, under the Venture documentation. This may be compared with the contract price including work additionals as submitted by Collings Construction of $106,064.

Tanti was the chairman of the Misadventure Club. That group received the sum of $375,000 from the Corporation. The payment is the subject of a defence in the nature of a set off on which the respondents rely. The evidence of Tanti as chairman of the Misadventure Club describing its formation, composition and function, I think, gives a very good insight into the financial and personal harm occasioned to the owners by the conduct of the respondents, but in particular by the Venture group. The evidence to which I refer follows: "Q. Can I move to another topic and that is damages. What is the total amount of compensation, if I can use that description, that you have received to date from the Building Services Corporation? Can you give me a figure? 
A. As a group? 
Q. A total figure? 
A. $375,000.

Q. No, you personally? 
A. I haven't seen anything personally, as such, to date. Any money that was allocated to me has been put in a trust account, and on agreement of the Group that money that has been put into a trust account is to be used for further fighting funds.

You have to understand, we have never ever initiated a court proceeding. We have always been on the back foot, having to defend ourselves, whether we have been taken to arbitration or whatever. We have been there to protect ourselves.

All the money that was every expended hasn't been expended because we wanted to do it. We had no other avenue, full stop. That money has been put into an account, and it can't be touched unless for further use for further fighting funds.

That has been listed in Mr Russo's affidavit, and in a letter he has sent to me. That's what the Group agreed on that night when we first received the monies, that that's what the money would be used for, and money - any money that came out of the TPC case would then be for my benefit.

Q. Why haven't you chosen to derive some benefit from what has been received from the Building Services Corporation today? 
A. Because I am part of this action.

Q. So what? 
A. So what? 
Q. Yes.

A. As far as I am concerned I am not out to get rich out of this. All I ever wanted to do when I got involved in the Building Services Corporation hearing was to make sure that the five people that weren't picked up by the Trade
Practices Commission got some sort of compensation.

Q. This is something you are doing for people who aren't represented by the
Trade Practices Commission? 
A. You must understand, we formed a group. Initially that group was formed to give moral and financial help for everyone. Now, if I had gone up against
Wayne or Harry in a legal proceeding I would never be able to afford it.

That was part of my dilemma when I had to go and get the Building Services
Corporation's money. At that point I felt like not getting the money. I would have rather sold the block, got rid of the house the way it was, and just pocketed the money, and just wait and see what was going to happen.

I was forced into that issue. I was told, "If you can't rebuild the home Mr
Tanti you don't get Building Services Corporation's money". So we formed this group early in the piece for just that, moral and financial help for everyone.
So, at least if we pooled our money we would have some chance.

I must say, its been reasonably effective. I don't think I could have gone through this by myself, I don't think I could have.

Q. When you say "it has been reasonably effective", are you saying you are pleased that you have been able to extract $375,000 out of the Building
Services Corporation and use it in a fighting fund in order to maintain further proceedings in this court? 
A. No, not at all. By that I mean, it has been effective in that at least my marriage is still alive. Because I've spoken to many people who have had similar type instances that are now divorced. As far as moral - as a moral help it has been a moral help. Everyone else in the group will certainly say that too, because no matter who you talk to, to them it is your problem. But when I talk to Mr Ferris or Mr Grimston, at least when I am talking to them they understand, they know. They really understand. But if I talk to the average person at work or something, they understand, they feel sorry for you, but they don't really understand that it is a day to day thing, that it is not something that happens and goes away.

I mean, this has being going for four years, and for four years I have either had to write a statement, I have had to be on the phone to a solicitor, I've had to take time off to attend court hearings, Building Services Corporation hearings. I'm sick of it now. I just want to be rid of it.

Q. Now, this club that you refer to as the "Misadventure Club"? 
A. Yes.

Q. Does that club have a leader? 
A. Yes.

Q. Or a chairman? 
A. Yes.

Q. Who is that? 
A. That's me.

Q. That's you? 
A. Yes.

Q. Did you form the club? 
A. No, I didn't form the club.

Q. Does it have a set of rules or a constitution? 
A. Not as such. It is just a - like I said, it was a group which formed to give moral and financial assistance to one another. There's no hard set rules or regulations.

Q. You have meetings? 
A. We have meetings 
Q. Does somebody keep minutes of the meetings? 
A. We started to generally, but no, not really. I mean, people write down - like we might happen to - "Well, Michael, are you going to be sorting out Mr
Beresford's cheque this week?", and I'll say, "I will speak to Diane, and we will certainly get a cheque drawn up for that." Mr Grimston might say to me, "Well, John happened to mention that he hadn't been paid for the last amount", and I will say, "Well, I might get on to it". They are the only notes that are kept. There are no real minutes or strict regulations.

Q. Throughout all this time that this "Misadventure Club" has been in operation, members of the club have been represented by Russo & Partners, is that the position? 
A. Yes, pretty much, yes, I would imagine so, yes.

Q. At the same time, seven couples, including yourself and your wife, have been represented by the Trade Practices Commission in these proceedings? 
A. Not at the same time. The club was formed much before we were ever taken up by the TPC.

Q. Why did you need to have a fighting fund if you had the might of the
Commonwealth picking up the cudgels on your behalf? 
A. Do you really want to know? Because to this date we are still being issued with court orders, and anything outside what happens here the TPC have not been picking up the tab for, or anything preceding the TPC taking us on. So, all those debts that we incurred were prior to the TPC action. Those debts have always been there." (T94.18 - 96.57) 
In the latter part of 1990 the Tantis acquired an undeveloped block of land in a district known as Glenmore Park (the Glenmore Park property) with the intention of building their home on it. For this purpose they established a budget limit for building costs of $120,000. Their search for a builder brought them to Home World and Collings Construction display homes. The design that interested the Tantis was known as "Chateau Royal". The other building on display was known as "Louisiana" and it was in that building that on 16
February 1991 the Tantis came into contact with Richards who provided them with a business card of Collings Homes identifying him as its sales manager.
Amongst the literature made available to the Tantis was a brochure of Collings
Homes in the usual form and on which Tanti observed the description of
Collings Homes as a "personal builder". He also obtained a copy of the marketing guide. There followed a conversation with Richards concerning the details of the Chateau Royal design. The inspection revealed some cracking in the walls in the vicinity of the kitchen area and when those were brought to the attention of Richards his comment was "don't worry .... those are caused by settling. All new houses settle. And if it does happen, we'll have someone to fix the gyprock. No problem". The price quoted by Richards for the Chateau
Royal was $105,313 which he amplified by saying on a number of occasions "what you see is what you get". Richards added that "Collings builds a quality home". He further stated that the then current recession meant that there wasn't "much work out there for sub-contractors, so the work gets finished in very good time". It was made clear to Richards that the budget limit was $120,000. As to site costs, Richards, not having inspected the Glenmore Park property, ventured the expectation that site costs could be a little over $6,000.

Tanti left this meeting with the clear understanding that Collings
Construction was the builder of the home under discussion. It was his evidence in cross-examination that this view did not change and that, even when required to enter into a building contract with Venture, he was still of the understanding that Collings Construction would remain in control of the works and ensure its due completion in accordance with arrangements that the Tantis had entered into with Collings Construction. Indeed, as is referred to later in these reasons, Tanti retained that understanding until April 1992 when the position changed as described in cross-examination by Tanti as follows: "Q: It was your firm belief right throughout the construction of your house? 
A: No. Up until the point when everything started, that is when it looks like it was starting to divide, I was starting to see that Harry really had the ruling and Wayne was sort of not there any more for us.

Q: At what point of time did your belief change&gt; (sic) 
A: Probably at about early April that would have been.

Q: Early April of what year? 
A: 1992.

Q: That was then during the progress of the building? 
A: Yes, that is right.

Q: But up until that time, this firm belief that I have referred you to was held by you, and your wife to your knowledge? 
A: Yes, to my knowledge." (T102.34 - .53) 
At the first meeting with Richards, Tanti had picked up his references to "sub-contractors" and "our contractors" and "our suppliers" and the reference to "our past jobs" and having to fix gyprock together with the reference to
Collings Homes as a builder in the Collings Construction brochure. This fixed in Tanti's mind that he was dealing with the prospective builder of their home.

Tanti also took from this first meeting the marketing guide and from its schedule of items in bold stamp marked "INCLUDED" he satisfied himself as to what was included in the prices offered by Collings Construction. Not surprisingly, he failed to pick up the asterisked exclusion of most of those items. This did not come to his attention until it was pointed out to him in late 1993.

On 19 February 1991 Tanti had a telephone conversation with Richards in which the latter informed him that Richards had inspected the Glenmore Park property and viewed its access and topography, from a construction viewpoint, very favourably. On being informed that the Collings Construction quotation was available, arrangements were made to meet Richards at the Collings
Construction office on 28 February 1991. At that meeting, Richards produced the Collings Construction quotation documents all of which were in the usual form. The total cost quoted was $111,533 made up of the builder fee of $99,533 and a Collings Construction fee of $12,000. The work additionals totalled $10,260, the item "Builder's discount" was noted "to be negotiated" and no sum was allocated to that item. It was the understanding of Tanti that what the
Tantis were being offered was a fixed building price. The summary identified the basic price as being $93,313 with five provisional sum items making up the "Contract Price" of $99,533. Being in the usual form, the summary contained numerous provisional sum items which had no sum allocated to them. At this meeting Tanti observed that the items for which provisional sums which had been designated relating to site preparation, the water service, electrical connection, sewer connection and storm water totalled $6,300. This, he noted, was in line with the site costs of a little over $6,000 which Richards had anticipated would be site costs prior to his inspection of the Glenmore Park property.

Subject to one matter, I accept the evidence of Tanti that he understood the
Collings Construction offer to be a fixed price made up of the cost of $111,533 plus the work additionals and that where no sum was allocated to an item in the provisional sum schedule it was included in the contract price.
The qualification I have relates to the provisional sum item described as "Extra Cost of Concrete and Filling above standard home allowance pier, step, beams etc".

It was the evidence in chief of Tanti that the standard Chateau Royal design was based on piers and floor joists, except for a concrete slab in the area of the garage and rumpus room. However, it is clear from his cross-examination that during construction he checked the depths of excavations for piers and that he understood that the necessary depths for those excavations could affect cost (T51.55 - 52.37). I think the reality is that Tanti understood that, in general, the provisional sum items to which no sum had been allocated were items which were included in the price that, having regard to the nature of the Glenmore Park property, there was no reason to believe that the provision of sub-surface elements would involve anything other than the "standard home allowance". There remained a theoretical, but, in the light of
Richards' assurances, highly unlikely possibility that an unexpected depth of hearing could lead to additional costs. Further, in negotiations between the
Tantis and Collings Constructions, Collings altered the design to substitute a concrete slab for some piers. In making that change Collings assured Tanti that the change would effect a saving on a pier form of construction (T64.43 - .57). Tanti also pointed to the fact that he was given a fixed price during the course of negotiations for an extension of eaves which involved pier support. He asserted, with some justification, in my opinion, that there was no suggestion in that quoted variation of a provisional allowance for depth of piers.

The varied report found that most of the provisional sum items should have been estimated and included in a firm contract price. There has been no satisfactory explanation offered by Collings Construction or Venture for their resort to the unconventional practice of designating those items as provisional sum items. One is left with the overwhelming impression that the mechanism of designating work as provisional sum items was an illegitimate device to cloak the fact that the so called contract price was not a reliable contract price: that it was one which was subject to significant increase during performance of the works.

At the meeting with Richards on 28 February 1991 further possible changes were discussed, a number of which Richards agreed to effect without any extra charge. By arrangement, the Tantis called at the Collings Construction office on 17 March 1991 where a deposit of $1,000 was paid to Collings Construction.
Despite an earlier assurance that an updated quotation would be prepared,
Richards failed to produce it at this meeting and he undertook to attend to that matter. On that assurance and on the further assurance that all details had been agreed upon at the earlier meeting, the deposit was provided. The receipt issued by Collings Construction was on its letterhead, which described its business as that of master builders and contractors and it advertised the fact that it was a member of the MBA. During the course of this meeting
Richards recommended to the Tantis that they deal directly with Exclusive
Kitchens for the required kitchen fittings by which means, he claimed, the
Tantis would save "the profit margin" which Collings Construction would normally claim. By this stage the Tantis had put up for sale their residential property at St Clair where they then resided. This information was imparted to
Richards at the meeting.

Within a few days of that meeting Tanti received a phone call from Collings to inform him that Richards had left the employment of Collings Construction, as a result of which the Tantis were requested to call at the office of Collings
Construction to "go through things together" with Collings. That meeting took place on 23 March 1991.

At that meeting it was necessary for the Tantis to go back over the matters that had been discussed between them and Richards. There is a significant difference in the evidence of the content of the meetings with Collings as evidenced by Collings and Cozzupoli when compared with the evidence of the
Tantis. The significant area of difference lies in the claim by Collings, in part supported by Cozzupoli, that the structure of the Collings Construction quotation was carefully explained to the Tantis, including the division of the roles of Collings Construction and its builder. According to Collings, the
Tantis appeared to well understand these matters. I am quite satisfied that no such detailed explanation was provided by Collings to the Tantis and, in substance, I accept the evidence of the Tantis. I note that Tanti asserts in that evidence that Cozzupoli had little or no part in the discussions that took place between the Tantis and Collings. Other areas of difference and of agreement in the evidence of Collings and of the Tantis arose but, in the approach I have adopted to these issues, those matters are of little or no significance. In general, the meeting resulted in Collings, sometimes reluctantly accepting whatever the Tantis stated had been agreed between them and Richards. Tanti took the opportunity to inform Collings of the Tanti's budget limit of $120,000 and to discuss further changes. The effect of these further changes resulted in a contract price together with work additional items totalling $120,683 (including the Collings Construction fee of $12,000).
Before the conclusion of this meeting Collings unsuccessfully endeavoured to obtain a further deposit from the Tantis.

On 2 April 1991 a further payment of $1,000 was made by the Tantis. The receipt issued by Collings Construction was in the same form as Collings
Construction's first receipt. Collings took the opportunity of raising the possibility of further changes to the proposed building while Tanti reminded
Collings of some areas of agreement which might have been overlooked.

As had been suggested by Richards and discussed with Collings, the Tantis visited the premises of Exclusive Kitchens on 26 May 1991 and arrangements were made for the payment by them of a deposit which was paid on 4 June 1991.
There were further meetings between Collings and Tanti in June of 1991, including one of 17 June, when a further payment of $900 was made by Tanti to
Collings Construction. At this meeting the samples of tiles and bricks which had been selected by the Tantis were submitted to Collings who approved of each choice.

When the Tantis visited the Collings Construction office on 24 June 1991 they found plans available for their inspection. However, despite numerous previous assurances, concerning the preparation of an up to date quotation, that was not available. At this meeting a more serious matter emerged in the form of confusion over the project design plan which Collings Construction was using for the subject quotation. The Chateau Royal was advertised in different design forms, including the SL9 which had a list price of $103,950 and the
SL12 with a list price of $120,032. The home building which had been inspected by the Tantis at the display centre was an SL12. Tanti noticed at this meeting that the plan did not reflect the layout of the home inspected at the display centre and Collings acknowledged this, saying that "the display home is an
SL12. Your home will be an SL9". Collings was informed of Richards' repeated comments that "What you see is what you get" while inspecting the display home. By this stage the position of the Tantis had been made vulnerable by the fact that they had sold their residential property in which they lived and were required to vacate it by 12 July 1991. Collings suggested a compromise, if it is apt to so describe it, of enlarging the offered design for an additional cost of $3,200. There were other discrepancies in the plans submitted by Collings at this meeting, principal among which was the change from a wooden floor and pier construction to a concrete slab. As to this change the following conversation took place: "(Tanti) "How can you do this? The display home has one thing and you give us another" "We're using a concrete slab because its cheaper. On top of that slabs settle less. There's less chance of cracked walls." " 
The concern of Tanti was heightened by these matters and he insisted that
Collings Construction submit the long outstanding revised quotation which
Collings undertook to arrange.

The new quotation arrived on 29 June 1991. The quotation as submitted was found by Tanti to contain further errors similar to those which had plagued earlier dealings with Collings Construction. Those matters were clarified or corrected and further, comparatively minor, changes were discussed with
Collings, with the exception of one item which Collings noted on the work additional schedule as "credit $2,619 by builder to Mr & Mrs Tanti". This item was not understood by Tanti at the time and was not explained further by
Collings who once again promised to have an acceptable quotation resubmitted.

On 16 July 1991 Tanti again visited Collings at the office of Collings
Construction where a BC3 contract was presented to him which Collings described as standard. Tanti briefly read through the document and noticed that under "particulars of work" the contract referred to Collings
Construction's tender letter of 16 February 1991. He also noticed that the form of contract had been signed on behalf of Venture who Collings explained was "our franchised builder". He further went on to explain that the representative of Venture, Kioussis, had been in the Collings Construction office "about 3 months ago, and he signed contracts for five different projects we got going". This aroused some concern on the part of Tanti who observed that there had been a number of changes discussed and agreed upon since that signing to which Collings replied: "Everything has been discussed with Harry as we've been going along. He's obligated to build the house we've agreed on, and he has to do it at the price
I quoted. What we need now is for your payments to be brought up to $14,619." 
That gave rise to the following further conversation: "(Tanti): "How do you get that figure?" : "My charge for the copyright plans is $12000. Add the $2619 builders credit - you get that back from Harry. That's $14619. You've already paid us $2900. Why don't you pay $11000? That'll only leave a few hundred dollars to pay." : "Alright, I guess. I'll pay that $11000 soon. What concerns me Wayne is this: we thought that Collings would be building. I thought you'd be the one supervising construction." : "Don't worry. We'll be liaising with Venture all the time. They'll do things our way. It's my job to liaise with everyone involved on the job, to make sure it runs smoothly." : "Okay. I suppose there won't be a problem. I'll have this back from my solicitor in a day or so." " (Exhibit A, par 105, p 63) 
The advice that Tanti received from his solicitor concerning the contract proffered by Collings was that it was a standard contract and appropriate to be signed by the Tantis.

Given the state of the negotiations between the Tantis and Collings at the time that Venture executed the proposed form of contract for the Tantis: given the extensive changes to the Tantis' requirements that had been discussed and rediscussed in their several meetings with Collings since that signing, prompts the question, what possible purpose could Collings Construction have in signing up Venture at that stage? One almost inevitable result meant that the contractual scope of works and hence the Collings Construction price was out of date and understated when the ink was wet on the Venture contract. I have come to the conclusion that neither Collings Construction nor Venture was unaware of this anomaly and each was content to maintain the practice for the benefit of retaining an unrealistically low contract price which was vulnerable to substantial increases during performance through variation claims and claims in respect of provisional sum items.

On 19 July 1991 Tanti informed Collings on a visit to the office of Collings
Construction that the form of the contract proffered by Collings Construction was acceptable, whereupon Collings suggested that an arrangement should be made to meet Kioussis. I have no doubt that, by mid 1991, Collings was well aware of the Venture Group's untrustworthiness and predatory attitude towards the owners and that in structuring the contractual arrangements in the manner
I have described and in putting the Tantis into the hands of Venture, Collings
Construction and Collings must bear responsibility for what followed.

On 24 July 1991 Tanti contacted the office of Collings Construction to ascertain progress on the submission of plans to council only to be told no plans had been submitted for council approval. The next meeting with Collings and the Tantis took place on 26 July 1991 at the Collings Construction office where the Tantis sought clarification of items on the plans which had previously been presented by Collings Construction. None of those items appear to have any particular significance. At the conclusion of the meeting Collings requested a further payment of $11,000. So far as one can ascertain from the evidence in chief of Tanti there does not appear to have been any discussion between Tanti and Collings seeking clarification of the payments requested by
Collings which exceeded the agreed $12,000 for the Collings Construction fee.
In any event, on 16 August 1991 a further $11,000 was paid by Tanti to
Collings Construction upon receipt of which Collings noted there still remained to be paid $719, presumably making up the figure of $14,619 which had been referred to in the meeting between the Tantis and Collings on 16 July
Collings further observed that there was a 5 per cent deposit of $5,000 to be paid to Venture. Before leaving the meeting Tanti informed Collings that in attending on Exclusive Kitchens they had placed a deposit of $500 with that organisation. This gave rise to some concern by Collings who stated that he would recover the deposit for the Tantis. No explanation was given for this apparent change in the approach adopted by Collings Construction to Exclusive
Kitchens. It was not until 20 August 1991 that Collings informed the Tantis that their plans for the proposed works had been submitted to council for approval. Later that day Tanti paid the balance requested by Collings
Construction of $719.

It appears that a month went by without any apparent progress. On 22 September , Collings, in a telephone conversation with Tanti, reminded him "that we need that $5,000 for Harry Kioussis before things can proceed". On 24
September 1991 a cheque payable to Collings Construction in the sum of $5,000 was given to Collings by Tanti and a receipt issued in the name of Collings
Construction.

I am satisfied that had the Tantis been aware of the unreliability of the contract price offered by Collings Construction: that Collings Construction had no responsibility under that arrangement past design stage: that Venture was incompetent and a commercial predator they would not have dealt with
Collings Construction. In my opinion, the fact that the Tantis took legal advice in the matter does not detract from that finding.

On 26 September 1991 Kioussis introduced himself to Tanti in a telephone conversation and arranged a meeting for 27 September 1991.

Tanti was not accompanied by W Tanti at this meeting which must have been an unusually distressing encounter for Tanti when it became evident that Kioussis had no intention of respecting the arrangements which had been made by the
Tantis with Collings Construction. At this meeting Kioussis went through the same fraudulent representations as to his qualifications as he had done with other owners and there then followed, after certain formalities, a challenge by Venture to the Collings Construction arrangements. This was introduced with the observation by Kioussis: "OK then, as I said, I'm worried by some of the things that you and Wayne have worked out." 
There then began a series of references to items which had been agreed to be included in the contract price but for which Kioussis claimed insufficient provision had been made. Tanti complained as follows: "What gives Wayne the right to work out costs and quantities if you're going to vary them?" 
The response of Kioussis was off handed, namely, "You'll have to ask Wayne that one". Kioussis then turned to the cost of excavation, describing its provision as "light". The concern of Tanti was expressed as follows: "Hold on. What's going on here? I don't have money to spare. I've relied on the prices I've been quoted. Now you reckon the sunken lounge is going to cost more, and the excavation is going to cost more. If you're saying that, what else do you want to vary?" 
The conversation then turned to other provisions for particular items some of which Kioussis passed over and to others he objected. For example, he objected to the provision of a pergola except as a variation. When it was pointed out to him that it was shown on the plans he had signed, Kioussis commented "We'll have to see about that. I'll be talking to Wayne about that ...." Kioussis then observed that there was insufficient provision for the extended eaves.
There then passed the following revealing exchange between them: "(Tanti): "You're kidding. What else is there. You're telling me that $1900 is not enough. All he's doing is extending the eaves a little bit and putting up those two columns. If you knew that you couldn't build my house for the price in the contract why did you bother to accept the job?" : "Well by that time, you'd already paid Wayne his $12000, so why should I let on to you. It was your decision and you'd given Wayne your money by that stage." : "I don't believe this." " (Exhibit A, par 134, p 82) 
That admission could only be described as brazen. Moreover, I think it is reasonably clear that by September 1991, Collings must have known that in handing the owners over to Venture without any attempt to protect the owners from the predatory behaviour of Kioussis, that Venture would take full advantage of the unsatisfactory contractual structure initiated by Collings
Construction to create either fresh contractual arrangements, or make demands during the course of the works designed to extract from the owners significantly greater sums than the total contract price, including work additionals. I prefer the view that Collings deliberately refrained from attending meetings between the owners and Kioussis on the basis that what he did not know might not hurt him.

When the discussion between Tanti and Kioussis turned to the credit of the excess payment made by the Tantis to Collings Construction, Kioussis maintained that he knew nothing about that matter. When that point was reached
Tanti expressed the view that this attempt at renegotiation of the Tantis' agreement with Collings Construction had gone far enough and he sought to call an end to the meeting. This forced Kioussis into making a telephone call to
Collings after which Kioussis reported that matters had been explained to him by Collings and that he would "work things out". He then proceeded to discuss other aspects of the proposed works. This further discussion was not without disharmony, with Kioussis declining to agree with Tanti performing certain works on his own account and in which Kioussis objected to the use by the
Tantis of Exclusive Kitchens. Towards the end of the meeting Kioussis produced for the signing by Tanti, building contract documents which included a BC3 contract, the plain english document and special conditions in the usual form, the quotation of Collings Construction of 16 February 1991, the marketing guide, Larkin's plans, architectural plans and specification in the usual form. As to the BC3 form of contract Tanti protested that such a document had been previously executed with Collings Construction. Kioussis maintained that the fresh execution was required as Collings "didn't put all the information in about .... getting finance ...." and other matters. He was reminded that the Tantis were not obtaining finance. However, Kioussis insisted it was purely a formal matter and until he obtained the Tantis signature he could not "get on with the building". Kioussis resisted any suggestion of taking legal advice and ended with the words: "Go through it now and sign it, and the house will start. If you don't sign, I don't proceed." 
Pressured in this way Tanti signed. There is little doubt in my mind that
Tanti signed the agreement under pressure from Kioussis and in the knowledge that he was heavily committed to the project through the large sums of money which he had paid Collings Construction, the organisation which he still believed to be the builder in control of the project and that, although he had considerable cause for concern in the way Kioussis handled the meeting with him, Tanti accepted that the form of contract signed by him was essentially that executed with Collings Construction. He also accepted that Kioussis and
Venture did have superior expert qualifications for the building of the proposed home.

Contrary to Kioussis' assurance the Venture contract differed substantially from the Collings Construction arrangement in much the same way as occurred in
Venture's dealings with the other owners.

To allay his concern over the developments arising out of the meeting with
Kioussis, later in the afternoon of 27 September 1991, Tanti had a telephone conversation with Collings in which he informed Collings of the objections of
Kioussis to the Collings Construction agreement with the Tantis. The response of Collings was reassuring, to the effect that Venture had to perform the contract as agreed with Collings Construction and this would be made clear to
Kioussis. This confirmed Tanti's understanding of the overriding control of
Collings Construction over Venture. In order to get W Tanti's execution of the contract documents a second meeting was arranged for 28 September 1991. At that meeting W Tanti took the opportunity of raising with Kioussis the concerns of Tanti as related to her from the meeting of 27 September 1991. All she received was an empty reassurance from Kioussis.

Approximately a week after these meetings, Venture made a written demand for payment of $9,707 made up of a claim of $17,326 which was, in effect, an illegal claim for a deposit from which was deducted the excess payments by the
Tantis to Collings Construction, totalling $7,619. Tanti paid that claim on 11
October 1991. At the time of that payment Kioussis provided Tanti with what purported to be minutes of the meeting of 27 September 1991. By this time the
Tantis had received the Venture introduction letter which was in the usual form.

Thereafter the dealings between the Tantis and the Venture group followed the unfortunate pattern that marked the dealings of other owners with that group about that time.

Because of the concessions made as to the failure of Venture to perform the works according to acceptable standards and the reference of construction issues to the referee, the evidence of the progress and of the defects is sketchy. It is probably sufficient to note that the varied report found that the performance by Venture was so deplorable as to require the complete demolition and rebuilding of the works on the Glenmore Park property, at a cost of $152,843. Not even the slab foundation was worth repairing.

However, one can elicit from the material that was introduced into evidence, that work on the Glenmore Park property proceeded spasmodically, in a dilatory manner and with defects which were relayed on to Kioussis by Tanti. The further trademark of the Venture technique was experienced by the Tantis with the receipt of a series of variation claims, followed by insistent demands for payment which ignored the standard of the works so far performed. On the face of it, there was the usual run of over-inflated and doubtfully based claims for variations. Then there came the threat of arbitration by Kioussis who appeared to ignore the slipshod performance to date on the Glenmore Park property. Notwithstanding, Tanti made a further payment of $27,780 shortly after 7 December 1991 in response to these demands. By the beginning of
February 1992 nothing had been done by way of the erection of a frame of the building, the performance of that framework in the first week of February occasioned the need for further complaints to Kioussis concerning errors of construction.

Claims for further variations continued into 1992 with the usual claim for concrete over and above the "standard home allowance" (one wonders if there was any concrete planned to be used for the "standard home"). There was a further related variation for the cost of putting in piers: a claim which was in keeping with the usual run of such variation claims by Venture. The Tantis were shocked by these claims in the order of $10,000 and raised the matter with Collings in a telephone conversation and then a meeting with him on 11
February 1992. Collings undertook to take up some of the matters of complaint with Kioussis. Tanti then made further arrangements to confer with Collings on February 1992 and with Kioussis on 13 February 1992. At the meeting with
Collings Tanti made it perfectly clear that he could not afford these sort of variations and queried the $7,000 claim for extra concrete and the variation claim for the piers. As to the latter, Collings maintained it was a valid extra. In response to the charge by Tanti that these items should have been included in the contract price, Collings stated: "We've got business to run. We can't be expected to detail the charge of every change. Basically, its our responsibility to try to build the contract items of your house for the contract price. If you want things outside the contract its your responsibility to pay. We can't be expected to worry about those details." 
Collings was reminded by Tanti that those very site costs had been the subject of discussion in early meetings with Collings and that he had never suggested that they would involve extra costs: further, that the Tantis had been exposed to price increases through the misunderstanding over the project design plan upon which the early discussions were centred. The meeting with Kioussis the following day was completely unsatisfactory with Tanti unsuccessfully attempting to ascertain the validity of Venture's variation claims and by attempting to explore methods of offsetting these claims, for example, by performing work for Venture at weekends. When Tanti informed Kioussis of
Collings' view that the concrete claim was inflated Kioussis responded belligerently stating: "What's the big idea of listening to Wayne! What would he know? He's not a qualified builder! Wayne wouldn't know the difference between a ring beam and a raft slab! .... as for Wayne Collings I knew that he didn't allow for extra concrete or piering in his original calculations." 
This resulted in the following further exchange between Tanti and Kioussis: "(Tanti): "If you're telling me that Wayne doesn't know what he's talking about, why did you let me proceed on the basis of his advice? Why didn't you bring this up before we signed the contract?" : "That's not my problem. You'd paid Wayne a commission of twelve thousand dollars by that stage. You made that choice, not me." : "So you're (sic) view is that you didn't care if I signed up with
Wayne and all of his details were wrong?" : "Well by that time it was too late. You had already given him the money." : "You're kidding." " (Exhibit A, par 221, p 137) 
The meeting continued with Tanti endeavouring to cancel any possible further changes that might have resulted in further claims for variations. Before leaving this meeting Tanti obtained from Kioussis some documents to assist him in checking the variations that had been the subject of Venture's claims on the Tantis. On studying these documents the Tantis found that there had been duplication of earlier paid claims and that there were charges for items that, in the Tantis' view, were clearly included in the basic price for the works.

On 24 February 1992 the Tantis called on Collings to discuss the claims currently being pursued by Venture. In some areas Collings took a critical view of the claims made by Venture. According to Tanti, the discussion then took the following turn: "(Collings): "Over all, It looks as though Harry is up to his old tricks." : "What do you mean?" : "I was giving work to Harry until two or three years ago. I had to stop because he was doing exactly this sort of thing. I guess he's doing it again. It's not only you. I've got other people complaining about Harry about excavation and so on. A couple of others have received similar bills to this." : "Why did you give the work to Harry if he's done this before? A leopard can't change its spots." : "Because Harry came back to me and said he was desperate for work.
He convinced me that he'd changed his ways." : "You've got to be kidding. Do you mean to tell me that you knew about
Harry and gave him a second chance? I don't believe this. This person put your company's integrity on the line by doing things like this and you gave him another chance! How bad was he last time?" : "I got rid of him last time when I found out tricks that Harry was playing on building projects he was doing work for the Department of Housing and for Telecom. Warwick Hooper from Housing and Harry Burgess from Telecom told me what he was doing. They found out he was overcharging heavily, and they got rid of him early in the piece." : "How could you put this guy in charge of my home and money?" : "I know I was stupid. I gave him too much work straight off. I should have waited to see if he could prove himself on a couple of jobs first.
I gave him about eight jobs on the burst. That was a mistake." : "So what happens now?" : "I'm locked in with Harry. I've got an agreement with him. I'll talk to him about this bill though. Harry can't claim stuff like travelling, telephone and supervision under our agreement." : "Yeah, but what about the contract I signed with Harry?" : "What contract?" : "When I went out to see Harry the first time, he had me sign a new contract. He said it was just a formality. That was the first meeting when he was questioning your calculations." : "That's outrageous. He has to be joking, hasn't he. I gave him so much work and now he does this. I'm going to be talking to him." " (Exhibit A, par 228, pp 142-145) 
Collings denied the substance of that conversation. He insisted that, while he had referred to past problems with Kioussis, those problems, he maintained, were not related to financial matters but were difficulties attaching to the manner in which Kioussis behaved in negotiating contracts. Tanti agreed that when he informed Collings at this meeting that Venture had required the Tantis to execute a further contract, Collings appeared genuinely outraged or surprised.

According to Collings' version, information concerning the dishonesty of
Kioussis, did not come to him until sometime in March 1992 when two prior employees of Venture informed him that Kioussis had been deliberately altering sub-contractor invoices with the use of a copying machine: that it was those invoices that were submitted to unsuspecting owners: that this was a practice that Kioussis had followed with Dainton Goff Homes some two to three years previously with the Department of Works and Telecom and that a person named
Warwick Hooper (Hooper) from Telecom and Harry Burgess from the Department of
Works had been named as persons who could provide further information on that subject matter. Collings undertook to contact those persons to ascertain what information he could concerning Kioussis' dishonesty. Collings firmly denied having any knowledge of that kind prior to the receipt of information as described above.

Collings has some support in this in the affidavit of evidence in chief of
Hooper who was not required for cross-examination. This affidavit confirmed that Hooper had no knowledge of nor had he received any communication from
Collings prior to a telephone call by Collings to him on 24 March 1992. I have little doubt that Tanti is confused in his timing concerning the revelation by
Collings of the dishonesty by Kioussis and I accept that, whatever the Tantis were told by Collings on that matter, it was the result of information recently obtained by Collings.

There were a number of exchanges in the second half of February 1992 which achieved little by way of resolving the problems that had become entrenched in the performance of the works on the Glenmore Park property, despite extensive efforts by Tanti to involve Collings and Kioussis in the resolution of those problems. It reached the stage where Kioussis maintained he could not continue the works without further architectural details from Collings Construction.
This was disputed by Collings. During this period some work did proceed on the
Glenmore Park property with the usual attendant errors in construction and further claims were made by Venture by way of progress claims or variation.

It was about this time that the television current affairs programme, "The
Investigators", became interested in the conduct of Venture and Collings
Construction - a matter of which Kioussis became aware and raised in a meeting with Tanti in early March 1992. Kioussis was also aware of the activities of the Misadventure Club. At a meeting with Kioussis on 3 March 1992, Tanti made clear his disappointment at the manner in which Venture and Collings
Construction had approached their contractual dealings with the Tantis. The response of Kioussis was, to say the least, revealing as appears from the following discussion between them: "(Kioussis): "The one you should really be angry with is Wayne Collings. The extra costs are his fault. He has made it impossible for me to proceed the way
I want to, because he doesn't provide the details that a builder needs to do the job properly. Your house isn't the only one the costs have blown out on.
That has happened on every house I'm building for Wayne. He underestimates on everything to make the client happy. Nobody could build houses for the prices that Collings quotes." : "If that's true and you knew it, why did you get us sucked in? If you were a decent human being you could have warned me of the extra costs before accepting the job." : "Well what would you have done if I did?" : "I would have approached Wayne Collings and delayed the construction date. Listen Harry, I don't known how much is your fault, and how much is
Wayne's fault for not supplying the proper detailed drawings for Venture to follow, but I do know that I shouldn't have to check every second day to pick up if the work is being carried out correctly." " (Exhibit A, par 248, pp 151-152) 
It was at this time that Tanti retained Beresford to advise them in relation to their construction problems. He inspected the Glenmore Park property on 6
March 1992.

Collings also must have become aware of the looming publicity problems in which he was about to be engulfed as appears from his telephone call to Tanti on 7 March 1992 offering to assist in providing a consultant's fee to inspect the work of Venture on the Glenmore Park property. Tanti refused the offer.

In early March matters came to a head with a report being received from
Beresford as a result of his inspection and with Tanti referring the state of the construction works to the local council. About the same time the Tantis retained Russo. By mid March 1992 the Tantis retained a further consultant,
Howard Ryan (Ryan), to advise them in their predicament with Venture and in a telephone conversation of 18 March 1992 Kioussis was informed by Tanti of the retainer of Ryan.

The second half of March 1992 was taken up with the exchange of correspondence between Venture and the Tantis, none of which was particularly productive.
During this period the matter was brought to the attention of the Corporation by Tanti.

On 21 April 1992 Tanti, on behalf of W Tanti and himself, gave notice of termination of the contract to Venture. This purported termination was rejected by Venture who at the same time took the opportunity to threaten arbitration proceedings. Notice of termination was confirmed by further letter of Tanti to Venture of 28 April 1992.

At the end of April 1992 the Tantis received notification from Venture of variations which Venture claimed were due and in respect of which it was alleged the Tantis were in breach by non-payment. Following these communications the Tantis contacted the Corporation and, following a meeting with a representative of the Corporation on 5 May 1992, the Tantis advised
Venture by letter dated 5 May 1992 of their intention to withdraw the notice of termination.

The response to that letter was by facsimile of Venture of the same date which confirmed the commencement of "arbitration procedure" and a willingness to accept the withdrawal of the notice of termination conditionally upon the
Tantis meeting with Venture by 8 May 1992 and by payment of outstanding claims for variations and progress claims. On the same date the Tantis received a telephone call from P Kioussis who acknowledged the latest communication from the Tantis and congratulated them on their decision "to negotiate instead of joining the group and being pig-headed like some other people who are stirring up trouble".

A meeting took place on 8 May 1992 at the Venture office between the Tantis,
Kioussis and P Kioussis. The meeting was not productive in terms of the objective of the Tantis to obtain a properly constructed residence on the
Glenmore Park property. However, it was instructive in terms of the insight it gives to the dishonesty of Venture and Kioussis. Not lacking in audacity, the opening gambit of Kioussis was to demand payment of the second progress claim.
Tanti reminded him that that claim was for the framework in respect of which he stated that Penrith City Council had imposed a stop work order. Kioussis dismissed this as "minor problems". It appears that room sizes of the building so far constructed departed from the contract plans. Kioussis passed this problem off as being the fault of Collings. When reminded that it was the responsibility of Venture "to check plans before proceeding", Kioussis responded "you can't enforce that clause and that's that". It also appears that W Tanti had only initialled the BC3 form of contract and Annexure A and
Kioussis sought to use the opportunity to have her execute those documents at this meeting. This she declined to do. It also appears from this discussion that Venture had supplied the Tantis with a survey in support of Venture's variation claim for survey costs. The survey purported to show the subject works as a brick house with a tiled roof surrounded by a fence and incorporating a patio: none of which things, Tanti asserted, existed at the time of the date of the survey. Kioussis was disarming in his response, namely: "It was a simple mistake. What do you want me to do? Hang him?" 
P Kioussis chimed in stating: "The surveyor made a mistake. He's quite embarrassed about it. He's fixed it up. Here's a copy of the new survey." 
It also appears by this stage that the Tantis had obtained quite a deal of information to suggest that the Venture claim for additional concrete was fraudulent. The following account of the discussion of that subject at this meeting in the evidence in chief of Tanti leaves one with little doubt that the suggestion of a fraudulent claim was well founded. The conversation was as follows: "(Tanti): "We think you've charged too much in the variations for the concrete." : "The contract allows for that mark up. I have to make a profit.
Anyhow, I've decided to drop these charges for extra concrete from $7440 to about $5800." : "You've allowed 18 cubic metres for a standard slab, but I've worked it out to be closer to 23 metres of concrete." : "Okay. I'll drop those charges." : "That's not good enough. I've seen the original price." .....................
 : "This is the bill to you from Konok, the concrete contractors. This total bill is for less than $10000, but you've tried to charge me nearly that for extra concrete and piering." .....................
 : "I checked my figures back on March 10th. I found they were a bit wrong." : "Why didn't you tell us about your decision earlier than this? Why didn't you show us original receipts form the contractors when we asked you for them earlier?" : "You are doubting me! I don't like that! I gave you receipts at our last meeting!" : "Those were photocopies. There were bits missing from them......." " (Exhibit A, pars 314 - 316, pp 190-191) 
Kioussis then returned to the subject of the payment of the second progress claim, in respect of which Tanti enquired on what basis Venture considered itself entitled to payment. Kioussis responded by asserting that the subject work had been passed by the inspector of the Penrith City Council. Tanti reminded Kioussis that this did not accord with the information Tanti had received from that inspector. In relation to other obvious over charges,
Kioussis dismissed them as "a simple mistake".

In the first half of May it appears that little was achieved by way of resolving the outstanding problems between the Tantis and Venture or by way of further performance of works on the Glenmore Park property. The Penrith City
Council issued a notice setting out details of the works which were not in conformity with the statutory requirements and in mid May the Tantis received advice from Venture of its request to the MBA to appoint an arbitrator to determine the subject disputes. There coincided with this, receipt of a notice of dispute from Venture dated 30 April 1992 but not received until 15 May .

On 20 May 1992 a site inspection took place in the presence of P Kioussis, the
Tantis, Ryan and a consultant retained by Venture. The meeting ended acrimoniously with some vituperative comments by P Kioussis directed to W
Tanti. The remainder of May was taken up with the exchange of correspondence which was of little help in resolving any of the outstanding problems confronting the Tantis.

On 8 June 1992 the Tantis were informed by the MBA of the appointment of Mr B
O'Mara as arbitrator under the reference initiated by Venture.

In the second half of July it appears that Venture returned to site to perform some rectification work required by the Corporation. On 4 August the Tantis received a report from consulting engineers, Kneebone, Beretta & Hall Pty
Ltd re the structural stability of the slab constructed on the Glenmore Park property. On 26 August 1992 the Tantis through their solicitor by a letter dated 26 August 1992 notified Venture that the contract was terminated. On 3
September 1993 the Tantis received a further report on the state of the works from a builder Todd Rybeck (Rybeck).

It appears that prior to October 1992 the Tantis submitted a claim under the
Corporation insurance scheme.

Subsequently the Tantis retained a builder to demolish Venture's work and to rebuild. This work commenced in November 1992.

In the following month the Tantis received notice of the lodgment of a caveat over the Glenmore Park property by Venture.

On 2 April 1993 the Tantis moved into the completed home on the Glenmore Park property.

For the most part, the conduct of the Venture group during 1992 may be characterised as premeditated harassment of the Tantis aimed at dissuading them from pursuing claims against Venture and at seeking to force payment of unfounded claims.

I fully accept the evidence of Tanti that he initially dealt with Collings
Construction on the clear understanding that it was to be the builder of the works under discussion and I reject completely the evidence of the Collings
Group that the true division of roles between Collings Construction and
Venture was ever clearly enunciated to the Tantis. When the truth did emerge it was far too late for the Tantis to protect themselves.

It was put to Tanti in cross-examination that he was in error in attributing to Richards the statement that "Collings build a quality home". Tanti's response was "he said exactly that.... he said builds, because we then made jokes about the cracks in the walls .... (to which Richards said) you won't have those in your house, our contractors would come out and fix those anyway if they were to occur" (T26.24). Tanti recalled further saying to Richards "we want fans, what if you want extra power points?". (Richards) said, "no problem, just slip them $20 or a case of beer no problems we allow that. We are not the kind of people that basically are that hard on our contractors ...".

When reminded of the reference in the Collings Construction quotation to independent franchise builders, Tanti maintained that he saw that as consistent with Collings Construction as the building company employing the franchise builder. He expressed it in the following way: "I still had in the overall scheme - it is headed "Collings Construction
Company Pty Ltd, a member of the MBA". I was told it had been the business so many years. His father had been out there doing buildings, and Wayne had basically taken over the company. When I saw that, that did not mean anything to me, "franchise builder". As far as I was concerned it was still someone employed by Wayne." (T36.52) 
Tanti was also influenced by the quotation and negotiations for an "all-up price", the effect of that aspect he expressed as follows: ".... I asked for an all-up price. Collings were the ones quoting all the prices to me. They didn't say, "Hey, Mr Tanti, you better speak to the builder because he is the one who is finally going to bill us for it". They were quoting all the prices all along.

Whenever I asked for something .... I was never handed over to their so-called franchise builder, and asked to find out the price off him. I was always quoted a price by Mr George Richards or Mr Collings ...." (T37.6) 
Speaking of this deception Tanti stated: "I think it was very dishonest, because now today I know that finally and utterly the contract wasn't with Collings, at the end of the day, it is all washed up I know now .... (When) the building problems started, that is when
Mr Collings soon abandoned us." (T28.37) 
Tanti fixed that time as April 1992.

As in the case of other owners I have been left in no doubt that Collings
Construction practised a deception on the Tantis in holding itself out as the builder or building supervisor of the proposed works and that it structured its arrangement with the Tantis in such a way as to create a contract price which was not the true price for the works. As found by the varied report, it was a price well below a reasonable contract price such that if the subject works had been provided for that price the builder would not have recovered the building costs or any profit margin. The contract structure enabled the builder to claim sums greatly in excess of the contract price during the performance of the works by exploiting the provisions for provisional sum items. The task of exploiting this structure was made so much easier by the inclusion of provisional sum items in relation to which no sum was allocated.
A further element in the deception was the provision of a contract price which had not taken account of changes to the scope of works which had been made prior to contract. Added to that was the composition of the marketing guide which required extraordinarily close scrutiny in order to establish what was included and what was excluded from the "Basic price". When it is realised that the Collings group and the Venture group were dealing with individuals of limited financial resources who had made this fact known to both Collings
Construction and Venture, this conduct on the part of Collings Construction is made all the more serious. I fully accept the evidence of the Tantis that had they known the true contracting position of Collings Construction and known that they would be abandoned, to use Tantis' words, once the design fee had been paid and had they understood the true nature of the contract price they would not have parted with their money to Collings Construction or entered into any financial arrangement with it.

Although Collings has some measure of corroboration in the evidence of
Cozzupoli in his claim that the contractual position was carefully explained to and understood by the Tantis, that evidence simply cannot stand beside the evidence of the Tantis which I am satisfied was both truthful and reliable.

The treatment of the Tantis by Venture was nothing short of predatory in the manner in which it obtained the Tantis' execution of the Venture contract, in the manner in which it formulated its contractual provisions, in its resort to dishonest use of the variation provisions of the contract and in the sheer incompetence of the organisation. I doubt if it can be seriously suggested that the Tantis did not rely upon the fraudulent assertions of Kioussis and did not act in the belief that the contract documents they were executing fitted the description given to them by Kioussis and in the belief that
Venture was highly competent in the skills required to execute the subject works. There is no doubt that, had they known of Venture's true nature and incompetence and the true nature of the contract they were required to sign, they would have had nothing to do with the Venture group.

On their behalf the Commission has summarised the Tantis' claim for damages as follows: "1. Paid to Collings Construction .03.91 $ 1,000.00 .04.91 $ 1,000.00 .06.91 $ 900.00 .08.91 $ 11,000.00 .08.91 $ 719.00 $ 14,619.00

Some General Questions 
Assessing the loss or damage suffered by the owners requires detailed examination of specific items of claim which have been put in issue by the respondents. There are some fundamental questions which I think should be addressed before directing attention to particular items of claim. Those questions I perceive to be:
What is the true measure of damages that should be applied? It will be seen from the summaries of the claims for damages of the respective owners set out in these reasons that the Commission takes a position which is comparatively unrefined in that it seeks to recover on behalf of the owners as loss or damage suffered by them all outgoings which they would not have incurred had they not entered into contractual arrangements with Collings
Construction and Venture and which were over and above the outlay which the owners would have faced had Venture constructed the works for the contract price plus work additionals which had been accepted by the owners under their arrangement with Collings Construction. The Commission draws no distinction between the liability of Collings Construction and of Venture. The loss or damage so expressed does not fit snugly into any preconceived concept of the measure of damage for deceit or for contractual breach.
What is the effect, if any, of the receipt by various owners of: 
Monies paid to the owners by the Corporation under the Corporation insurance scheme, 
Monies paid by the Corporation pursuant to a deed of settlement in favour of the Misadventure Club in respect of claims based on an alleged actionable fault on the part of the Corporation in granting a licence to Kioussis under the BSC Act, 
Monies of a like nature to that described in par (b) paid by the
Corporation to the Staps, 
Monies paid to the Corbetts by the Wollondilly Council in settlement of claims made by the Corbetts against Wollondilly Council alleging negligent approval of the subject works by Wollondilly Council inspectors?
Whether it is open to the Court to include in any assessment of loss or damage compensation for damage for vexation or aggravated damages?
Whether the respondents should be given leave to amend to rely upon the limitations provisions of <case>(1CA).
The True Measure of Damages Under the Act 
In one sense, the assessment of loss or damage under <case>(1A) of the Act is an uncomplicated exercise in causation. In order to address that question the first step should be to isolate with sufficient clarity the nature of the contraventions which are said to have caused loss or damage. Once that is done the general nature of loss or damage suffered by that conduct should emerge.
In performing that task it is necessary to have recourse to the principles of causation as explained by the High Court and to the extent to which the principles of analogous measures of damage in deceit and in contract may require some refinement of the scope of loss or damage recoverable under s (1A).

In describing the contraventions of Collings Construction and of Venture under the discrete headings of their dealings with the respective owners I have not found it necessary to distinguish unconscionable conduct and representations as to future conduct from contraventions within the meaning of <case> of the
Act. In my opinion the essential nature of the contraventions in this case fall squarely within <case>.

In the case of Collings Construction: 
It held itself out as a builder or builder supervisor which would oversee the building of the subject works when it had no intention of involving itself beyond design stage.

It was a corporation which set about obtaining the commitment of the owners to arrangements with it by constructing a contract price which was superficially and deceptively very competitive when, in fact, it was constructed on a contractual foundation of provisional sum items and provisions for variations which, in the circumstances, ensured that the contract price could be greatly increased during performance of the works by adjustment of provisional sum allowances and by variation claims.

The contract price as offered was, below the reasonable price which would permit a builder, in performing the subject works, to recover building costs and a profit margin. It was aware of that fact, or at the very least, that the price was so low as to put in some doubt the builder's capacity to recover costs and profit.

In its relation with Venture, I am of the opinion that Collings
Construction was well aware of the propensity of Venture to take advantage of this contract structure by exploiting its provisional sum items and variations provisions and by forcing fresh contracts upon the owners in the knowledge that they were committed to the project through the payment of irrefundable deposits to Collings Constructions.

In recommending Venture, I am satisfied that there was no reasonable basis for holding out Venture as a builder with a "reputation for excellence and a true craftsman".

In so recommending Venture and in signing up Venture, in some cases, without the prior authority of the owners, I am of the opinion that Collings
Construction must take responsibility for the consequences of Venture being a commercial predator and an incompetent builder.

I am also of the opinion that as early as the last quarter of 1990 and by
May 1991 Collings Construction was aware of Venture's untrustworthiness and predatory attitude to the owners.

While Venture has conceded that it was guilty of contraventions under the Act, those concessions did not go nearly far enough. The findings I have made are that Venture induced the owners to enter into contractual arrangements with it by fraudulent representations as to the possession of high formal qualifications as an expert builder: that it adopted and modified the contractual structure initiated by Collings Construction to better equip
Venture to exploit those contractual weaknesses: that it was aware of the understatement of a reasonable contract price by Collings Construction and of
Venture's capacity to remedy that situation through exploitation of the contractual provisions to which I have referred: that it adopted aggressive tactics in extracting fresh contractual provisions from the owners (with the exception of the Quaglias) in the knowledge that they were committed to the project by the payment of significant irrefundable deposits to Collings
Construction: that, far from being a highly qualified builder of excellence and a craftsman, the organisation was extremely incompetent, indifferent to the needs and interests of the owners to the point of being a predator rather than the provider of services. I regard the indiscriminate institution of proceedings, the submission of spurious variation claims, threats of stoppages, acts of vandalism and threatening conduct towards owners as no more than the evidence of the contraventions upon which the Commission relies in these proceedings.

Where the contraventions include representations that Venture possessed very high standards of expertise, when it was hopelessly incompetent and representations that the contract price was a reasonable price for the contract works, when the works could not be built for that price: where the owners would not have entered into the subject contracts but for those contraventions of the respondents and where the incompetence of Venture was such that the works it performed were so defective as to require demolition, in whole or in part, and rebuilding at greater cost that the represented contract price, the loss or damage suffered by the owners should, in my opinion, provide for recovery of such costs of demolition and rebuilding as exceeds the represented price for the works. Particularly should this be so, in my opinion, where the owners who had entered into contracts with Venture had no practical course left open to them other than to demolish and rebuild what was intended to be their homes.

Putting aside the question of aggravated damages or damages for vexation, and the claim on behalf of the Quaglias, I am of the opinion that no distinction arises as to the quantum of damages to which the respective owners are entitled as against Collings Construction on the one hand or Venture. I have given detailed findings of the proscribed conduct of Collings Construction in relation to the deceptive contract structure it put in place, of its awareness of the exploitation to which that contractual weakness would be subject in the hands of Venture to whom it referred unsuspecting owners. When added to the absence of any reasonable basis for holding out Venture as a craftsman of excellent reputation and, on occasion, signing up Venture without the authority or knowledge of the owners and in the knowledge that the owners were committed to their project by that stage, I think it is appropriate to treat
Collings Construction and Venture as equally responsible for the damage suffered by the owners. In so far as Venture was a willing and active party to
Collings Construction's conduct by its exploitation of the arrangement presented to it by Collings Construction, Venture should be held equally responsible for the owners' loss represented by their payments to Collings
Construction.

It was submitted on behalf of the respondents that the claims by the
Commission on behalf of the owners were in the nature of damages for breach of warranty, and were made contrary to authority, in particular, Gates versus City
Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd (1986) 160 CLR 1, Wardley Australia Ltd v
The State of Western Australia <case>; [(1992) 175 CLR 514] and Kizbeau Pty Ltd & Ors -v- W G & B Pty Ltd &
Anor <case>; (1995) 185 CLR 281; [131 ALR 363:] that the respective claims suffered from a further break with authority, namely, that of Baltic
Shipping Co. versus Dillon <case>; [(1993) 176 CLR 344], as they involved a mixture of claims for restitution of monies paid by the owners to Collings and Venture in addition to damages in the nature of loss of expectation.

I do not understand Baltic Shipping to be addressing the question of causation involved in the assessment of loss or damage under <case>(1A) of the
Act. Perhaps the strongest statement in support of the submissions advanced on behalf of Venture is to be found in the following passage of Gibbs CJ in
Gates: "Section 87 enables the court to make, in addition, ancillary orders which include orders avoiding or varying a contract and directing a refund of money.

Actions based on ss. 52 and 53 are analogous to actions in tort and the remedy in damages provided by s. 82(1) appears to adopt the measure of damages applicable in an action in tort. That sub-section refers to loss or damage by the conduct of another that contravened a provision of Pt IV or Pt V; it therefore looks to the loss or damage flowing from the offending act of the other person. The acts referred to in ss. 52 and 53 do not include the breach of a contract, and in awarding damages under s. 82 for a breach of either of those sections, no question can arise of damages for loss of a bargain. The contractual measure of damages is therefore inappropriate in such a case. It has been held in the Federal Court in a number of cases that the measure of damages in tort, and not that for breach of contract, will apply in the assessment of damages under s. 82 where there has been a contravention of s.
 or s. 53: see Brown v. Jam Factory Pty. Ltd. (11); Mister Figgins v.
Centrepoint Freeholds Pty. Ltd. (12); and Brown v. Southport Motors Pty.
Ltd. (13). This view is plainly correct. I have recently discussed the measure of damages in an action for deceit in Gould v. Vaggelas (14)..." (at pp 6 and 7) 
This approach was expanded upon in the joint judgment of Mason, Wilson and
Dawson JJ when their Honours addressed the question of damages under <case> of the Act in the terms which follow: "Section 87 confers on the Court wide power to make ancillary orders to compensate persons who suffer loss or damage by conduct that was engaged in in contravention of a provision of Pt IV or Pt V. These include an order to pay the person who suffered the loss or damage the amount of the loss or damage: s. 87(2)(D).

The Act does not prescribe the measure of damages recoverable by a plaintiff for contravention of the provisions of Pts IV and V. Accordingly, it is for the courts to determine what is the appropriate measure of damages recoverable by a plaintiff who suffers loss or damage by conduct done in contravention of the relevant provisions. Two established measures of damages, those applicable in contract and tort respectively, compete for acceptance. In contract, damages are awarded with the object of placing the plaintiff in the position in which he would have been had the contract been performed - he is entitled to damages for loss of bargain (expectation loss) and damage suffered, including expenditure incurred, in reliance on the contract (reliance loss).
In tort, on the other hand, damages are awarded with the object of placing the plaintiff in the position in which he would have been had the tort not been committed (similar to reliance loss).........

Because the object of damages in tort is to place the plaintiff in the position in which he would have been but for the commission of the tort, it is necessary to determine what the plaintiff would have done had he not relied on the representation. If that reliance has deprived him of the opportunity of entering into a different contract for the purchase of goods on which he would have made a profit then he may recover that profit on the footing that it is part of the loss which he has suffered in consequence of altering his position under the inducement of the representation. This may well be so if the plaintiff can establish that he could and would have entered into the different contract and that it would have yielded the benefit claimed: cf.
Esso Petroleum Co. Ltd. v. Mardon (28); Doyle v. Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd.
. The lost benefit is referable to opportunities foregone by reason of reliance on the misrepresentation. In this respect the measure of damages in tort begins to resemble the expectation element in the measure of damages in contract save that it is for the plaintiff to establish that he could and would have entered into the different contract.

So in the present case if the appellant were able to establish that, but for his reliance on Mr. Rainbird's representation, he could and would have entered into policies of insurance containing a disability clause of the kind represented by Mr Rainbird, he might then succeed in obtaining an award of damages equal to the benefits which would have been payable under such policies less the premiums paid or payable in respect of them.

Unfortunately for the appellant the evidence does not support this basis for an award of damages.

The question then is whether it is appropriate to apply the contract measure of damages to the contraventions found to have taken place. The courts are not bound to make a definitive choice between the two measures so that one applies to all contraventions to the exclusion of the other. However, there is much to be said for the view that the measure of damages in tort is appropriate in most, if not all, Pt V cases, especially those involving misleading or deceptive conduct and the making of false statements. Such conduct is similar both in character and effect to tortious conduct, particularly fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent misstatement." (My emphasis) (at pp 11, 13 and 14) 
The passage emphasised is, in my opinion, a central consideration in the assessment of loss or damage suffered by contravening conduct. I think it underscores the fundamental need to focus on the specific nature of the proscribed conduct. It may be an excursion into the obvious to state that the scope and nature of the contravention will dictate the breadth of the damage suffered by it. Nevertheless, I think, its importance warrants that emphasis.
This approach, I think, is reflected in the following passage from the joint judgments of Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ in Wardley: "In the context of the Act, the concept of loss and damage, like the concept of causation, must be applied in a wide variety of situations because the contraventions of Pts IV and V which give rise to causes of action under s.
(1) are diverse. Here we are concerned with contraventions of s. 52(1) in the form of misleading conduct constituted by misrepresentations. In this situation, as at common law, acts done by the representee in reliance upon the misrepresentation constitute a sufficient connexion to satisfy the concept of causation. And, if those acts result in economic loss, that is, loss other than physical injury to person or property, that economic loss will ordinarily be recoverable under s. 82(1). In the context of the area of commercial conduct in which the Act operates, the reference to "loss or damage" in s.
(1) plainly includes economic or financial loss.

In determining when a plaintiff first suffers economic loss or damage in an action under s. 82(1) based on misleading conduct constituting a contravention of s. 52, it is necessary to have regard to the applicable measure of damages.
In this respect, it would not be right to conclude that the measure of damages recoverable under the sub-section necessarily coincides with the measure of damages applicable in an action for deceit or in an action for negligent misrepresentation. The measure of damages recoverable under s. 82(1) can only be fully ascertained after a thorough analysis of those provisions in Pts IV and V of the Act for contravention of which the statutory cause of action may be maintained. But the common law measure of damages will in many cases be an appropriate guide, though it will always be necessary to look to the provisions of the Act with a view to ascertaining the existence of any relevant legislative intention....." (at 525, 526) 
There are a number of cases, of which Demagogue Pty Ltd -v- Ramensky &
Anor <case>; [(1992) 110 ALR 608] is one, which are concerned with the ambit of the concept of loss or damage that may be recovered under <case> of the Act or under other statutory provisions comparable to <case> which emphasise the comprehensive measure of relief provided by such provisions and which express the statutory intention behind such legislation as imposing upon the Court a wide discretion within which to protect the consumer and ensure that the consumer is adequately compensated for the subject contravention. In my opinion, consistently with the principles enunciated by the High Court in the assessment of damages under the Act, those cases have emphasised the need to be on guard against unnecessary and artificial importation of limitations into the definition of "loss or damage" in <case> so as to restrict "the category of actionable loss or damage" (Demagogue at 625).

I think the approach I have adopted towards the assessment of loss or damage in these proceedings is also consistent with the observations of Lockhart and
Gummow JJ in Accounting Systems 2000 (Developments) Pty Ltd & Anor v. CCH
Australia Ltd & Anor [(1993) 114 ALR 355] at 387 et seq which include the following statements: " (1) As is the case with Pt IV of the TP Act, the evident purpose and policy underlying Pt V, which includes <case>, recommends a broad construction of its constituent provisions, the legislation being of a remedial character so that it should be construed so as to give the fullest relief which the fair meaning of its language will allow: see the discussion of the authorities by Mason CJ in Devenish versus Jewel Food Stores Pty Ltd <case>; [(1991) 172 CLR 32] at 44; <case>; [99
ALR 275.] The precise boundaries of the territory within which <case> operates remain undetermined: Concrete Constructions Pty Ltd versus Nelson <case>; [(1990) 169 CLR 594] at 601; <case>; [92
ALR 193.] 
Section 52 should be construed against the background of the general law, but the court should not be inhibited from giving effect to what on its proper construction is provided for in the legislation by the consideration that to do so may result in the imposition of liabilities and the administration of remedies which differ from those supplied by the general law: World Series
Cricket Pty Ltd versus Parish [(1977) 16 ALR 181] at 198-9 per Brennan J; Bill Acceptance Corp Ltd versus GWA Ltd <case>; [(1983) 50 ALR 242]; [78 FLR 171] at 175 per Lockhart J; Henjo Investments Pty Ltd versus Collins
Marrickville Pty Ltd <case>; [(1988) 79 ALR 83] at 102 per Lockhart J, at 109 per Foster J; Demagogue Pty
Ltd versus Ramensky <case>; [(1992) 110 ALR 608.] 
Whilst <case> speaks of "conduct", many of the decided cases have dealt with that species of conduct which involves what at general law would be classified as "representations" as to a present state of affairs. But it is necessary to keep steadily in mind when dealing with the statute that "representation" is not co-extensive with "conduct".....

There is a particular risk in the present case with the immediate transfer of common law concepts to the construction of the statute. It arises from a misconception as to the nature of the general law. Representations are generally perceived as extra-contractual, that is to say, if fraudulent, as tortious, and whether innocent or fraudulent, as providing a ground in equity of rescission of the transaction entered into as a consequence thereof......

The text of <case>(a) of the TP Act, which was inserted by the 1977 Act, has been set out .... Sections 4(2)(a) should not be read as confined in its application to Pt IV....

The result of this examination of the provisions of the legislation before and after the 1977 Act is that <case>(a), in dealing with "conduct", operates generally, in its terms, so that the TP Act after the 1977 Act, was to be read as "one connected and combined statement of the will of parliament ...":
Sweeney versus Fitzhardinge <case>; [(1906) 4 CLR 716] at 735. So understood, <case>(a) provides significant support....for the general proposition that the making of a statement as to a presently existing state of affairs, if false, may be engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct, where the statement is embodied as a provision of a contract. In many cases, there will have been pre-contractual conduct which itself contravenes <case>.....

When contravention of <case> is linked with a claim for damages under <case> and the representation complained of was a contractual warranty, it may be necessary to consider whether the measure of damages that would be recoverable under <case> would differ from that available at common law for breach of the warranty. That point was not ventilated in the present case. However, this situation does serve as a reminder of the danger of automatically translating into <case>, as the appropriate measure of damages, that recoverable in an action for the tort of deceit: cf Gates versus City Mutual Life Assurance Society
Ltd <case>; (1986) 160 CLR 1; [63 ALR 600."] (Pp 387 - 390) 
These observations reflect what was discussed by Gummow J, as his Honour then was, in Elna Australia Pty Ltd -v- International Computers (Australia) Pty
Ltd <case>; [(1987) 75 ALR 271] where his
Honour observed that "where the conduct complained of is promissory in character, the court should not be constrained by analogies derived from tort" and, in referring to Gates, noted that it was "a case concerned with the measure of damages for contravention of <case> of the .... Act, and, (that) in that setting Mason, Wilson, Dawson JJ, whilst favouring the tort measure, did point out that there was no necessity to make a definitive choice between the `contractual' and `tort' measures of damages so that one applies to all contraventions to the exclusion of the other". His Honour went on to observe that "tort and contract today are separated by rather less than clear bright lines (stating that to be) true both of acts, statements and omissions preceding entry into contract ... and of the standard required in performance of contractual obligations" (at 281 and 282).

I think this approach accords with the concept of causation explained by the
High Court in March -v- E & M H Stramare Pty Ltd & Anor <case>; [(1990) 171 CLR 506], Bennett -v- The Minister of Community Welfare <case>; [(1992) 176 CLR 408] and Medlin -v- The State Government Insurance Commission <case>; [(1994) 182 CLR 1.] The nature of causation inherent in the phrase "damage by conduct" where employed in <case> of the Act was the subject of discussion in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ in Wardley as follows: "The statutory cause of action arises when the plaintiff suffers loss or damage "by" contravening conduct of another person. "By" is a curious word to use. One might have expected "by means of", "by reason of ", "in consequence of" or "as a result of". But the word clearly expresses the notion of causation without defining or elucidating it. In this situation, <case> should be understood as taking up the common law practical or common sense concept of causation recently discussed by this Court in March -v- Stramare (E & MH) Pty Ltd, except in so far as that concept is modified or supplemented expressly or impliedly by the provisions of the Act. Had parliament intended to say something else, it would have been natural and easy to have said so." (At 525) 
I think the approach to this question of causation expressed in the joint judgment of Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Medlin in the context of the law of negligence is apposite to the question of causation that arises in this case. I refer to the following passage: "For the purpose of the law of negligence, the question whether the requisite causal connexion exists between a particular breach of duty and particular loss or damage is essentially one of fact to be resolved, on the probabilities, as a matter of commonsense and experience. And that remains so in a case such as the present where the question of the existence of the requisite causal connexion is complicated by the intervention of some act or decision of the plaintiff or a third party which constitutes a more immediate cause of the loss or damage. In such a case, the "but for" test, while retaining an important role as a negative criterion which will commonly (but not always) exclude causation if not satisfied, is inadequate as a comprehensive positive test. If, in such a case, it can be seen that the necessary causal connexion would exist if the intervening act or decision be disregarded, the question of causation may often be conveniently expressed in terms of whether the intrusion of that act or decision has had the effect of breaking the chain of causation which would otherwise have existed between the breach of duty and the particular loss or damage. The ultimate question must, however, always be whether, notwithstanding the intervention of the subsequent decision, the defendant's wrongful act or omission is, as between the plaintiff and the defendant and as a matter of commonsense and experience, properly to be seen as having caused the relevant loss or damage." (At p 6) 
The passage last quoted I think is a useful reference point for making a distinction in relation to damages for aggravation or vexation and other forms of loss or damage under <case> (1A). In considering the liability of Collings
Construction. While I have no difficulty in regarding Collings Construction as responsible for the building related damages suffered by the owners as a direct result of Venture's incompetence, it does not follow that Collings
Construction should be seen as causing the aggravated damages claimed on behalf of the owners. In my opinion, the Venture group alone should be responsible for such damages on the basis that the subject acts of Venture which have given rise to such claims for damages were peculiar to the nature of Venture and were no part of Collings Construction's conduct.

The approach by the Commission to the question of damages has been to claim all items of expenditure incurred by the owners in making payments to the respondents, in retaining solicitors or technical experts, in petitioning politicians or agitating media publicity, in seeking redress or defending their rights in other jurisdictions in actions initiated by Venture in addition to the costs of rectification demolition and rebuilding. It will be necessary to comment in some little detail in relation to some of those claims having regard to the particular defences raised on behalf of the respondents.
It is sufficient for immediate purposes to state that the claims ran very close to becoming ambit claims in some of the smaller items of reimbursement sought. Particular elements of the respective claims are capable of being identified as falling into a category of damages for breach of contract or damages for deceit. However, in my opinion, a successful challenge to the quantification of damage suffered by the owners does not depend upon a simple exercise of characterising the particular heads of damage in that way. In my opinion, the construction of <case> of the Act does not call for such a division. What is called for under <case> is a clear statement of the proscribed conduct involved and a determination of the loss or damage caused "by" that conduct: a deceptively simple excursion at the invitation of March into the common sense state of causation.

Approached in that way the task, as I have found it, is far from easy when the ramifications of the unique form of deception involved in the subject contraventions are addressed. In particular, while the owners are clearly entitled to the cost of demolition or rectification, mindful of the need to give credit for the possible value of the respondents' work retained by any of the owners, what of the cost of rebuilding and completion of the contracted works? Is the cut off point for loss or damage suffered by the owners reached when the defective works have been rectified by demolition or otherwise? Or is one entitled to go a step further and evaluate the cost of rebuilding and completing the works, allowing as a set off the represented contract price for the works? If that element of loss or damage is not allowed it seems to me that the loss or damage flowing from that misrepresentation as to price goes unrecompensed in the hands of the owners. There is no doubt that the owners were operating under a strict budget and would have entered into some other building contract within those limits. In my opinion, it is necessary to recognise that the nature and subject matter of the commercial arrangements involving the owners with the respondents was such that, once those arrangements were entered into, the owners were committed to the completion of the works, initially through Venture, and, then, when the respondents' conduct took effect, through the assistance of third parties. If the owners are to be treated as so committed to the completion of the works then it strikes me as reasonable that there should be included in the assessment of the owners' loss or damage that cost of completion of the works, allowing as a set off the contract price as represented by the respondents.

Accordingly, it is my view that the approach adopted by the Commission on behalf of the owners to this aspect of claim is a legitimate approach to the assessment of loss or damage under <case> of the Act. In my opinion, the principle remains the same whatever the stage of construction Venture's defective work had reached.

It will be seen, then, that I have not approached the task as one involving a selection of a measure of damages from the competing measure of damages in tort and in contract. I think the exercise is one of tracing the causative consequences of the conduct found against the respondents as distinct from donning a straight jacket of damages for deceit or for breach of contract as the damages to which the owners are entitled.
Corporation Insurance Scheme - <case> 
Were it not for the provisions of <case> of the BSC Act, the receipt of monies by the owners under the Corporation insurance scheme would present no particular difficulty. The law of subrogation operates in such a way as to avoid any injustice to the wrongdoer in the form of double payment of damages, or in the form of over compensation of the injured party, where damages are assessed without regard to any amount received by the injured party in the form of proceeds of an insurance indemnity against loss arising out of the subject injury. Where such proceeds of insurance are received by the party indemnified, the wrongdoer obtains no benefit as subrogation preserves the right of the insurer, in the name of the insured, to seek recovery of the subject damages from the wrongdoer. Where the injured party has received such an indemnity payment and in addition recovers damages for the subject injury from the wrongdoer, subrogation confers on the insurer the right to reimbursement from the party so indemnified and so avoids double compensation (see Castellain -v- Preston & Ors [(1883) 11 QB 380).] 
However, for reasons that are unapparent to the uninitiated, <case> of the BSC
Act appears to cut across the conventional concept of subrogation. S 98(1) provides as follows: "Any amount paid by the Corporation under BSC Insurance may be recovered by the Corporation in a court of competent jurisdiction as a debt from the person by whom the residential building work concerned was done or contracted to be done. " 
I am unaware of any aspect of the BSC Act or of the regulations made under it which would have the effect of displacing or of not giving rise to the conventional concepts of subrogation in relation to the Corporation insurance scheme - except as may be found in <case>. I tend to the view that <case> is essentially a statutory provision of convenience to facilitate recovery of payment the subject of that section and, at the same time, insulating the
Corporation from any claims, by way of set off, it could face in an action by subrogation against the wrongdoer. Alternatively, its statutory intention may have been to remove any doubt of the right of the Corporation to bring an action by way of subrogation against the wrongdoing builder. Some support for this view may be extracted from the terms of the scheme as prescribed in the
BSC Regulations. For example cl 8 of the scheme enables the Corporation to set off amounts against its liability under the scheme which includes "any amount received by the (building owner) under a settlement .... award .... or (under the) judgment (of any Court) ....". Again, conventional concepts of subrogation would confer such entitlements upon the Corporation. So it is obscure to me why it was thought necessary to put in place a provision entitling the Corporation to take into account such damages as may have been received by the building owner seeking indemnity under the scheme. To be consistent with this concept of a statutory code regulating payments under the scheme, one would expect to find a provision entitling the Corporation to obtain reimbursement from the building owner who receives damages from the wrong doing builder subsequent to a payment by the Corporation under the scheme.

Perhaps the debate that has attached to the conceptual nature of subrogation has something to do with the approach adopted by the legislature in the case of the Corporation insurance scheme. Subrogation has been held to apply to some five categories one of which includes a relationship of indemnification.
As to the extension of those categories by the Court it was said by Lord
Salmon in Orakpo -v- Manson Investments Ltd [(1978) AC 95] at 110 - a case that has not escaped some criticism (see Meagher, Gummow and Lehane, Equity:
Doctrines and Remedies (3rd ed.) par [910]) - that: "The test as to whether the Courts will apply the doctrine of subrogation to the facts of a particular case is entirely empirical. It is, I think, impossible to formulate any narrower principle than that the doctrine will be applied only when the Courts are satisfied that reason and justice demand that it should be." 
As to the conceptual substratum of subrogation the learned editors of
MacGillivray and Parkington on Insurance Law, 8 ed at par 1170 had this to say about the conflicting claims of equity and law: "It is submitted on the basis of recent House of Lords authority (referring to
Hobbs -v- Marlowe [[1978] AC 16)] and as a matter of legal history that subrogation in insurance law is a legal doctrine by origin. Equity later came to play a useful supporting role in the development of the doctrine. Equity's effective performance in that role has created the impression that subrogation was an entirely equitable doctrine, but equity should not be permitted to upstage the common law in that way." 
I am not so sure. Although Lord Diplock in Hobbs -v- Marlowe [[1978] AC ] at 39 and
Orakpo -v- Manson Investments Ltd [[1978] AC 95] at 104 favoured a concept of implied terms in contracts of insurance as lying at the foundation of the doctrine of subrogation, while at the same time confessing that other categories of subrogation appeared to defeat a similar classification "except as an empirical remedy to prevent a particular kind of unjust enrichment", I think the better view is that it was equity that has fostered the categories of subrogation. It was said in John Edwards & Co -v- Motor Union
Insurance Co Ltd [[1922] 2 KB 249] at 252 by
McCardie J that the origin of the doctrine as developed in the English Courts stem from the Roman law and had been widely applied in English law to sureties insurance and to matters of ultra vires - in the case of insurance law from the beginning of the eighteenth century, citing Randal -v- Cockran <case>; [(1748) 1 Ves Sen 98]; [27 ER 916.] In that case Lord Harwicke referred to the "plainest equity" in favour of an insurer to stand in the shoes of the insured to obtain restitution of that which had been paid by way of indemnity. The conventional wisdom of the nature of subrogation in surety cases characterises the doctrine as a creature of equity and as being independent of principles of contract
Australasian Conference Association Ltd -v- Mainline Constructions Pty Ltd <case>; [(1978) 141 CLR 335] at 348. It has been said that "subrogation gives effect to a broad sense of unconscionability where it regulates outcomes. Liabilities or debts and the commission of wrongs are brought home to the persons ultimately responsible.
Double compensation is denied to the victims of wrongs" (Parkinson P., The
Principles of Equity, par 1501).

I think it is reasonably clear that, in considering the attachment of principles of subrogation as an incident to the operation of the Corporation insurance scheme, one should not be led into thinking that, as a prerequisite, one must be able to identify a contract of indemnity. Rather, I think the relationship of indemnification, in this instance arising out of statute, is sufficient to arouse the principles of subrogation to avoid the type of injustice that otherwise may flow in the form of double recovery by the indemnified or unwarranted credits benefiting the wrongdoer.

Although I do not see <case> of the BSC Act as displacing the Corporation's right of subrogation against a builder wrongdoer, in practice there would be little or no point in the Corporation resorting to rights of subrogation against the builder wrongdoer. Similarly, I see nothing in the relationship of indemnification between the Corporation and the owners which would operate to exclude the Corporation's right of subrogation to recover monies paid by way of indemnity to a building owner under the Corporation insurance scheme where that building owner has been doubly compensated by the further receipt of damages from the builder wrongdoer.

In this case it has been submitted on behalf of the respondents that in respect of any damages to be assessed against them, credit should be allowed for monies received by particular owners under the Corporation insurance scheme. In support of this submission, it was argued that not to do so would expose the respondents to liability for double compensation with the statutory indebtedness conferred upon the corporation under <case>. There is no doubt that the creation of the statutory debt under <case> creates an apparent difficulty of this kind. However, I am of the view that the payments should not be taken into account in assessing the owners' loss or damage. The adjustment of compensation received by the owners as between the owners and the Corporation may be left to be sorted out by the Corporation exercising its rights of subrogation. In theory, there is no obligation upon the Corporation to act in that way, as distinct from seeking direct contribution from the builder owner under <case>: however mindless that course might seem. The course I have adopted
I think is the appropriate one because it should ensure that the sorting out of the monies received by the owners by way of damages from the respondents or by way of indemnity from the Corporation should best be attended to between those groups where questions as to the coincidence of the subject matter for which the damages and indemnity have been received can be best resolved should there be some disparity in those two aspects.

If by some chance, which I would characterise as extraordinary, the
Corporation sought to enforce its rights against Venture under <case> of the
BSC Act, I do not see why, in principle, Venture could not join the owners in any such action aimed at the enforcement of the obligation of the owners to disgorge any duplicated compensation on the concept of unjust enrichment stemming from any such failure to reimburse the Corporation. cf. Trade
Practices Commission -v- Manfal Pty Ltd & Anor (No. 3) <case>; [(1991) 33 FCR 382] at 385; referred to in R Goff & G Jones, The Law of
Restitution (3rd ed) 1986, p 272 and Albion Insurance Co Ltd -v- Government
Insurance Office  <case>; [(1969) 121 CLR 342] at 350.

I am fortified in the approach I have adopted by the undertaking given by the owners under the deed of release between the Misadventure Club and the
Corporation dated 8 August 1995 (the deed of release) and by the Staps under a separate deed of release dated 18 July 1995, (the Staps' deed). By that undertaking the owners have covenanted with the Corporation to refund indemnity payments in the event of the owners being compensated for the same loss in these proceedings.
Corporation Payments Outside of Insurance Scheme 
The monies received by the Misadventure Club from the Corporation arose out of claims on behalf of that group against the Corporation alleging breach of its statutory duties in and about the licensing and the maintenance of the licence of Kioussis under the BSC Act. There was mediation and other negotiation between the group and the Corporation which resulted in the deed of release being entered into between the Corporation and the members of the Misadventure
Club. The parties to the deed of release include some of the owners, notably excluding the Corbetts and the Staps. The recitals to the deed of release acknowledged that the Corporation had paid claims under the Corporation insurance scheme to the Aquilas, the Smiths, the Ferrises, the Tantis, the
Grimstons, the Quaglias and others, not being the owners: further that these proceedings had been commenced on behalf of certain of the owners: that the group had claimed damages including "illness and trauma as a result of the
Corporation's alleged failure to fulfil its statutory duties in relation to the licensing under the BSC Act of Kioussis and in connection with the works carried out by Kioussis and that: "Without admission as to liability, in consideration of the (group) forbearing to take any action either jointly or severally, now or in the future against the Corporation in respect of the matters arising in the recitals .... the
Corporation will pay and the (group) will accept the sum total of $375,000 ("the agreed sum") as the agreed sum to be apportioned between the (group) as they see fit." 
The deed made provision for payment of the agreed sum by way of cheque drawn in favour of the "Misadventure Club, Russo & Partners Trust Account".

In consideration of that payment the group agreed to release the Corporation from all claims for breach of statutory duty relating to the subject building works and in connection with the licensing of Kioussis. Cl 7 of the deed was in the following terms: "The (group) agree to advise the Corporation, except as may be prohibited by court order, of any amount or benefit received by them as a result of the
Trade Practices Commission action against the Licensee which is an amount that is for rectification, completion or replacement of the work undertaken by the
Licensee for the (group) and agree to immediately repay to the Corporation any such amount or benefit insofar as any such amount or benefit is referable to monies paid by the Corporation to or on behalf of the (group) whether prior to the date of this Deed or in the future pursuant to the terms of any insurance scheme administered by the Corporation." (Exhibit 5) 
I think it is reasonably clear from the deed of release that the sum of $375,000 is not subject to refund. As I read cl 7, the obligation to refund any monies is co-extensive with what I have observed to be the obligations of the owners to reimburse the Corporation by way of subrogation, to the extent that there is any duplication in the damages awarded in these proceedings and the payments received by the owners under the Corporation insurance scheme. I think it is reasonably clear, from the recitals and terms of the deed of release to which I have referred, that the agreed sum of $375,000 is not a payment of monies under the Corporation insurance scheme and is not refundable. I think it is also clear that cl 7 only operates to require the refunding of such monies that are monies paid under the scheme "insofar as any .... amount or benefit (received through the proceedings) is referable to monies paid by the Corporation to .... (the owners) .... pursuant to the terms of any insurance scheme administered by the Corporation". That leaves untouched the monies received under the deed of release.

What effect , then, has that payment of $375,000 upon the assessment in these proceedings of the liability of the respondents for the loss or damage suffered by the owners? It will be noted that the payment was made into a trust account by the Corporation under the control of Russo. The way in which that account has been treated I have set out earlier in these reasons in an extensive quotation from the evidence of Tanti.

Based upon the provisions of the deed and on the evidence of Tanti alone I would not be disposed to bring to account any of the "fighting fund" paid by the Corporation to the group pursuant to the deed of release.

The Staps' deed mirrors the deed of release. It recited that the Staps had been paid the maximum indemnity under the Corporation insurance scheme of $100,000: that they asserted having suffered losses in excess of that maximum payment as a result of the Corporation's alleged breach of its statutory duties: that in consideration of the payment of $37,500, without admission as to liability by the Corporation to the Staps, they would release the
Corporation from further claims. The deed provided for the payment of that $37,500 and for the release of the Corporation from further claims. Cl 4 of the deed was in the following terms: "That the Releasor agrees to advise the Releasee of any amount or benefit received as a result of the Trade Practices Commission action against the
Licensee which is an amount that is related to rectification and/or completion of the said work undertaken by the Licensee and agree to immediately repay to the Releasee any such amounts received insofar as those amounts relate directly to monies already paid by the Releasee pursuant to the terms of the
Comprehensive Insurance Scheme." (Exhibit 11) 
Consequently the payment of $37,500 remains untouched by the receipt of the fruits of these proceedings by the Staps - their obligation to reimburse the
Corporation being directed to the sum of $100,000 they received under the scheme. The Staps, initially, were members of the Misadventure Club but, as a result of some internal dispute, they withdrew from the group and required a separate deed to complete settlement with the Corporation.

Through the evidence of Russo the Commission adduced a considerable body of evidence concerning the manner in which the interests of the Misadventure Club were administered by his firm and, in particular, the manner in which the agreed sum had been administered under that informal scheme. From his evidence in chief it appears that he began acting for the Smiths, Ferrises, Tantis,
Staps, Quaglias and the Aquilas from approximately November 1991 in respect of matters relating to the underlying disputes in the proceedings. During the period following, Russo kept individual records where professional work was undertaken or costs expended for a particular owner. During the period 1992 to when the Misadventure Club came into existence he commenced rendering fees to the Club in much the same way. Those latter accounts were rendered generally in relation to work which was not undertaken specifically for any individual within the group. As a result of those retainers, Russo acted for the individuals in various proceedings in the District and Supreme Courts, in arbitration, in mediation, in dealings with the Corporation, in the effecting of the deed of release resulting in the payment of $375,000 and in the administration of the fighting fund. He retained counsel and arranged for the payment of counsel's fees. He has also been involved on behalf of the group in the preparation of a brief to the New South Wales police fraud squad. He has retained expert witnesses on behalf of the group. As at 6 October 1995 a substantial amount of the fighting fund had been expended in manners evidenced in detail by Russo and which reflects the complexity of the many facets of his retainers. There remained held in trust amounts for the owners described as follows: "The Ferrises $30,466.00 
The Grimstons $20,897.00 
The Quaglias $19,638.00 
The Smiths $22,495.00 
The Tantis $21,786.00 and a draw down of account $25,912.00 for funds anticipated to be required for further legal costs and disbursements in the group's continued litigious dealings with the respondents." (Exhibit BT) 
I think the manner in which the payments under the deed of release and the
Staps' deed are required to be treated in the ascertainment of loss or damage under <case> of the Act involves an identification of the subject matter of those payments or of any part of them with the subject matter of the loss or damage to be assessed under <case>. A similar question was considered in
Simonius Vischer & Co -v- Holt & Thompson [(1979) 2 NSWLR 322] at 360 et seq by Samuels JA. In that case the plaintiff had received payment from its banker which it was alleged had failed to bring to the attention of the plaintiff aspects of its account which would have alerted it to irregularities in its trading which had resulted in action being taken against the plaintiff's auditors. In Simonius Vischer it was argued by the auditors that, in the assessment of those damages, account should be taken of the amount received by the plaintiff from its bank. In order to succeed in that argument, Samuels JA expressed the burden placed upon the defendants as one of identifying "the sum paid (by the bank) with losses forming part of the damages recoverable by the plaintiffs from the defendants" (at 361). His
Honour elaborated on that burden as follows: "The nature of the defendants' evidentiary burden can be seen from statements made by the High Court in McLaurin v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation and Allsop v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation (105). In
McLaurin's case (106) their Honours said: "It is true that in a proper case a single payment or receipt of a mixed nature may be apportioned amongst the several heads to which it relates .... But while it may be appropriate to follow such a course where the payment or receipt is in settlement of distinct claims of which some at least are liquidated ... or are otherwise ascertainable by calculation ... it cannot be appropriate where the payment or receipt is in respect of a claim or claims for unliquidated damages only and is made or accepted under a compromise which treats it as a single, undissected amount of damages. In such a case the amount must be considered as a whole." 
In that case, a number or itemised claims, some for lost revenue and some for losses of a capital nature, was settled for a smaller undissected lump sum. It was held that no part of the settlement moneys could be appropriated to any particular item of claim .... the basis upon which the amount paid had been determined was unknown ........." (at 361 - 362) 
I set out below the manner in which Samuels JA approached the rejection of the defendants' submission in Simonius Vischer as I think the remarks that follow are apposite in the consideration of the respondents submission in this matter. His Honour's reasoning was expressed as follows: "In the present case, however, the bank's reasoning, while not communicated to the plaintiffs, appears with reasonable clarity from the memoranda to which I have referred; and it does not establish that the payment was made in satisfaction of losses otherwise recoverable from the defendants. First of all, those losses were not at the time capable of precise quantification. The plaintiffs did not attempt to assess them exactly. Mr. Wuestiner told the bank that the plaintiffs had sustained losses of some [sterling]210,000 "mainly in the last two years" i.e. from 1963-5 approximately, as a result of the negligence of their own people and their auditors; and that the bank's negligence had been a contributing factor. Secondly, however, the bank's understanding was that it had been in breach of its duty since 1960, in respect of the plaintiff's account, and since 1962, in respect of the guarantee. Consequently, the bank's breaches of duty may have produced loss before any loss caused by the defendants' negligence became manifest. The two periods of loss, if I may so describe them, were therefore not congruent.
Thirdly, and this is, I think, the critical matter, it is clear that the bank was anxious to maintain its business connection with the plaintiffs. The last paragraph of the memorandum of 2nd September, 1965, which I have quoted above, is quite explicit. The sum of [sterling]25,000 was to be paid ex gratia "to protect the (sic) most valued business". That sum became [sterling]75,000, but non constat that the larger amount was not paid for the same purpose. The compelling inference is that at the least a substantial proportion of it - if not all of it - was paid to retain the plaintiff's business. If the amount paid for the purpose was not the whole, it is impossible to say what proportion of the whole it represented; and conversely, impossible to say what proportion might have been directed to some aspect of the plaintiff's accrued financial loss. That being so, the evidence does not permit the identification for which the defendants contend, and the argument must fail." 
Once that point has been reached, little assistance can be drawn from case law in determining whether the payments of any part of them should be taken into account in the assessment of damage against the respondents in these proceedings. I think the observation of Viscount Hall-Dane L.C. in British
Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co. Ltd -v- Underground Electric
Railways Co. Of London Ltd [[1912] AC 673] at 688 underlines this point in stating: "In order to come to a conclusion on the question as to damages thus raised, it is essential to bear in mind certain propositions which I think are well established. In some of the cases there are expressions as to the principles governing the measure of general damages which at first sight seem difficult to harmonize. The apparent discrepancies are, however, mainly due to the varying nature of the particular questions submitted for decision. The quantum of damage is a question of fact, and the only guidance the law can give is to lay down general principles which afford at times but scanty assistance in dealing with particular cases....." (at 688) 
In my opinion, it is an unrewarding exercise, and an unwarranted one, to analyse the administration of this fighting fund as evidenced by Russo in order to ascertain the nature of any benefits which the owners may have received under the fund in assessing the damages suffered by the owners by the conduct of the respondents. The individuals comprising the releasors are not coincident with the owners. The consideration for the payment of the agreed sums was, at least in part, the forbearance on the part of the releasors to sue the Corporation. There is no way of knowing whether the whole or any part of the agreed sums was calculated and agreed upon by reference to the very substantial sums that have been incurred by the releasors in their individual efforts to extricate themselves from litigation involving the respondents. In fact, the payment under the deed of release has always been treated as a fighting fund and I think this is reflected in the fact that no attempt was made by the Corporation to dissect the payment into individual entitlements. I would infer from the evidence of Tanti as to the objectives of the
Misadventure Club, from the terms of the deeds, from the manner by which payment was made by the Corporation, namely to Russo in trust to distribute as he saw fit, and from the manner in which the fund under the deed of release has been administered that a very strong element in the mediation and other negotiations between the Corporation and the releasors was the need for mutual, moral and material support and that this characterised the nature of the payment, namely that of a fighting fund, which was negotiated with the
Corporation. Given the propensity for Venture to initiate and prosecute proceedings on a variety of fronts in a pattern of harassment of the owners and the limited resources of the owners, the need for such a fund is apparent.
Although most of the litigation of the kind for which the fighting fund may have been required could be expected to be drawing to an end, particularly in the light of the undertakings to the Court by counsel on behalf of Venture to discontinue all of the arbitration proceedings, I really am not in a position to know what further demands there are likely to be made upon the fighting fund. While that may be irrelevant to the considerations involved in the reasoning of Simonius Vischer, I think it is relevant in identifying what entitlements if any the owners have under the deed. The deed of release confers no individual entitlement upon any of the owners and for all I know
Russo may be called upon to meet further substantial commitments out of the fighting fund. Furthermore, part of the consideration provided for in the deed of release called upon the owners to reimburse the Corporation its payments under the Corporation insurance scheme.

For those reasons I am of the opinion that the payment of $375,000 to the
Misadventure Club has no relevance to the owners' assessment of loss or damage except in the manner in which I have disallowed various items of claim made on behalf of the owners.

The Staps' payment should be treated similarly, notwithstanding the Staps' withdrawal from the Misadventure Club. The consideration given for the payment to the Staps was similar to that given by the Misadventure Club under the deed of release.

I am unaware of how the sum of $37,500 has been quantified: whether it was intended to cover costs of the Staps in attempting to mount a claim against the Corporation outside the Corporation insurance scheme or whether it was little more than an ex-gratia payment. As a practical matter, the Staps at one stage formed part of the Misadventure Club and it is a matter of chance that they are separate releasors of the Corporation. I think much of what has been said about the Misadventure Club in its dealings with the Corporation has some application to the Staps' case. For those reasons, the conclusion I have reached is that the payment under the Staps' deed should not be taken into account in the assessment of the owners loss or damage under <case> of the Act.
Wollondilly Council Payment 
The evidence concerning the payment of $125,000 by Wollondilly Council to the
Corbetts was as follows. By letter of 31 July 1992 the Corbetts' solicitor forwarded to the council a copy of a structural engineer's report recommending demolition of works on the Silverdale property as a result of defective workmanship, for which the solicitor alleged the council bore some responsibility for its negligent approval of the works. At the time, the cost of rectification was unknown. Following further communication between the
Corbetts' solicitor and a representative of council's professional indemnity insurer, by letter of 9 October 1992 the Corbetts' solicitor forwarded to the insurer further details of the allegation of negligent approval of defective structural works. Amongst those allegations was an assertion that, in reliance on an inspection of the Silverdale property by an officer of the council and his subsequent assurance of the completion of the subject works to the satisfaction of the council, the Corbetts paid Venture "approximately $70,000". At this point quotations for rectification of the defective works were submitted to the council on behalf of the Corbetts which totalled "approximately $350,00". By a facsimile to Corbett's solicitor dated 19
October 1992, the insurer forwarded a different version of events by the council's officer and noted that there was a possibility of the Corbetts receiving "some reparation from the BSC and, possibly, from other sources", no doubt referring to Venture. It was further noted that no provision had been made for salvage in the quotations forwarded in respect of the subject complaints. Other communications followed, the contents of which are unknown.
By letter of 9 November 1992 Corbetts' solicitor informed the insurer of the approval by the Corporation of a claim in the sum of $60,000. The claim against the council was accordingly reduced to $290,000 less salvage, as to which the insurer was invited to arrange an assessor to make an estimate of its value. By the same letter the factual differences between the parties were developed. The last communication on the subject, prior to the entry into an undated deed of release and indemnity by the Corbetts, with the council and its insurer (the Corbetts' deed), was a letter from the insurer to the
Corbetts' solicitor of 22 December 1992 in which it joined issue with many of the factual matters raised in previous communications on behalf of the
Corbetts. As a prelude to settlement, the letter contained the following statements and proposals: "Your client certainly has our sympathy, however, the real issue is whether
Council should bear the entire brunt of your client's misfortune. Your client cannot succeed against Council unless reliance can be proved. It will also be necessary that a reasonable person in the position of your client would have relied entirely on the building inspectors inspection (see for example Curran v Greater Taree City Council [(1992) ATR 81-152).] 
Needless to say, the situation is complicated by virtue of the conflicting evidence of each of the respective parties. Without any doubt as to the integrity of the building inspector's evidence, but facing the commercial reality of the situation, we acknowledge that Council faces some risk of being held liable for your client's loss. However we would not put that risk at any more than the risk facing your client of failing against the Council.

We note that in Mr Valtas's recent telephone conversation with the writer he indicated that Counsel's advice would be sought as to matters raised herein.
Accordingly, it is probably inappropriate for us to make any offers at this stage.

What we are prepared to do however is to consider a without prejudice offer from your client which is formulated on the following basis:- a) There is a discount on liability to reflect the conflicting evidence.
 b) There is a discount for any salvage value.
 c) There will be some sort of official investigation, perhaps by a consulting engineer who is proficient in steel frame construction, which would either confirm that there is no alternative to demolition and reconstruction or suggest possible rectification works. Similar steps will need to be taken in relation (to) the concrete slab.
 d) There be a discount for contributory negligence. Your client must accept some responsibility for the condition of the dwelling. Many of the defects to which you have referred would have been detected by your client if a sufficient degree of supervision had been exercised.
 e) There be a discount for any sum which was recovered or which is recoverable from any other party.

It will of course be difficult to formulate an offer in those terms in dollars and cents and accordingly we would suggest that the first step towards resolution should be to agree on percentages which reflect the respective discounts." (Exhibit AH, Annexure 107, pp 3 and 4) 
The Corbetts' deed recited the allegation of the Corbetts that they had suffered "loss and damage and a result of the council's failure to identify improper building practices during inspections of the (Silverdale) property ....": further that the "loss and damage (had) been caused and/or contributed to by the negligence and/or breach of agreement on the part of the council ....": it recited the fact that the council and its insurer did not admit any liability and maintained "a denial of liability in relation to the claim" and recited that the parties wished to "avoid the costs and risks of litigation".
The agreement to pay the sum of $125,000 was expressed as follows: "The council's Insurer agrees to pay the (Corbetts) the sum of $125,000 (one hundred and twenty five thousand dollars) inclusive of all costs and expenses." 
The deed released the council and the insurer form all claims "which arise out of or are related to (the) recitals" and indemnified the council and the insurer against any such claims. It is reasonable to infer that some portion of the sum of $125,000 was paid to dispose of a claim for loss and damage arising out of the defective performance of some aspects of Venture's work.
The difficulty of taking that sum into account in examining a different question, namely, the loss and damage suffered by the Corbetts by the contraventions of the respondents, stems primarily from the following considerations. First, the concept of damages which were at issue between the
Corbetts, the council and its insurer is quite different from that of the loss or damage to be ascertained under <case> of the Act. Second, partly as a result of that difference in concept and as a result of the different features of the contraventions with which these proceedings are concerned and the alleged acts of negligence of the council, it is difficult to identify any aspect of the s loss and damage which could be said to fall within the damage the recovery of which was claimed against the council. There are some elements of the damage to be assessed in these proceedings such as for vexation or aggravated damages which have nothing to do with the nature of the claim against the council. Where there is some apparent coincidence of damage sought to be recovered in these proceedings and sought to be compromised in the settlement between the Corbetts and the council, identification of any amount of damage caught in that overlap is clouded by the fact that the payment of $125,000 represented a payment for the avoidance of the risk of litigation and included payments for unspecified and unquantified costs and expenses of the Corbetts.
Claims advanced on behalf of the Corbetts in these proceedings detail costs of their solicitors engaged in the claim against the council and its insurer and
I think it is reasonable to have regard to those details in endeavouring to evaluate the components of the payment by the council under the Corbetts deed.
That has not been of particular assistance to me.

However, where I have been able to identify costs incurred by the Corbetts in pressing their claim against the council I have excluded those costs from the
Corbetts' claim in these proceedings.

Otherwise, the claim on behalf of the Corbetts was formulated in these proceedings on alternative bases as shown in schedule form earlier in these reasons. As stated in these reasons the assessment of the rectification costs in the varied report fell short of the actual costs incurred by the Corbetts by some $120,000.

I think this actual loss of $120,000 suffered by the Corbetts which will not be recovered in these proceedings affords another reason for concluding that the council payment of $125,000 cannot be identified satisfactorily with the loss or damage for which the Corbetts are entitled to be compensated in these proceedings. For all I know the council payment was for the damages which will be unrecovered in these proceedings.

It was also submitted on behalf of Venture that the payment to the Corbetts pursuant to a deed of release given to the council operated to release Venture as a "joint tortfeasor". In passing, counsel for Venture referred in written submissions to a passage in the transcript at T1348 which purports to record my understanding of the submission as referring to the "joint tort being in respect of duty of care to the Corbetts as well as to the other parties to these proceedings". That has never been my understanding of the submission.
There is no possible basis for characterising the alleged liability of the council and that of Venture as joint tortfeasors or as joint wrongdoers.

Such liability could only be as concurrent wrongdoers and it has never been the law that a release of one operates as a release of a concurrent wrongdoer as distinct from the situation, not suggested here, where an injured party obtains full satisfaction from a concurrent wrongdoer. See Castellan -v-
Electric Power Transmission Pty Ltd & Anor [(1967) 69 SR 159] at 180.
Limitation Provisions - <case>(1CA) 
There then remains the question whether the respondents should be permitted to raise the question whether any of the claims are statute barred.

In my opinion, the respondents should not be given leave to amend their defences to rely upon the provisions of <case>(1CA) of the Act which provides that an application may be made under <case>(1A), in the case of conduct in contravention of Pt IVA, within two years and, in any other case, within three years after the cause of action has accrued.

As stated earlier in these reasons, no limitations defence was raised in these proceedings prior to 24 October 1995 - two years after the commencement of the
Federal Court proceedings and approximately twenty-two months after the respondents' consent to the amendments to the application which saw the additional owners added pursuant to the consent orders of Wilcox J of 15
December 1993.

It was submitted on behalf of Venture that its application of 24 October 1995 to amend to include a limitation defence was prompted by my ruling of 23
October 1995 as to the date the amendment ordered by Wilcox J was deemed to take effect: whether from its date, or the date of the commencement of the
Federal Court proceedings. I preferred the view that the order operated from the date it was made, the effect of the amendment in part, being in the nature of an addition of parties. During the later course of the proceedings, as noted earlier in these reasons, I indicated to counsel that I proposed to reconsider the ruling and invited further submissions on the question.

I have found no reason to change my views on this topic, nor do I see that my earlier ruling on this matter has any significant bearing on any entitlement of the respondents to have leave to amend to rely upon a limitations defence.

I am of the opinion, without reaching any view as to the substance of such a defence, that it would be quite unfair to expose the owners to the prospect of their claims or any part of those claims being defeated by such a defence. I think it is sufficient to say that authorities such as Wardley, Magman
International Pty Ltd versus Westpac <case>; [(1991) 32 FCR 1] and the decision of Pincus J in Trade Practices Commission v
Frendship Aloe Vera Pty Ltd & Anor [(1988) 82 ALR 557] are sufficient warrant for the proposition that time limitation questions under s (1A) are difficult and vexed questions, the outcome of which in litigation of this kind could not be confidently predicted either at first instance or on appeal.

I do not think this is a case where costs would sufficiently protect the owners in the event of leave being granted, even if such an order extended to one requiring the respondents to pay the costs to date of amendment of any issue to which such a defence was successfully raised. It is clear, I think, from the evidence of Tanti in relation to the circumstances in which the
Misadventure Club was formed that, as a general observation, the owners are persons of limited resources. It is also clear, I think, that those resources have been subjected to severe strain by reason of the conduct of the respondents as found in these proceedings. It is significant that the owners had undeniable rights at common law for fraud and breach of contract in relation to the Venture group which rights had not expired at the time of the institution of the Federal Court proceedings. It is quite evident that the capacity of the Commission to bring these proceedings on behalf of the owners has afforded them an opportunity of having their claims litigated at minimum expense. Further, I am mindful of the fact that the Commission's application for leave to amend the application in the Federal Court proceedings to add the
Corbetts, the Grimstons and the Staps to the owners on whose behalf claims were sought to be brought under <case> by the Commission, was consented to by the respondents. It is my view, had the respondents wished to raise a defence in bar of this kind then, that was the time to raise it. I think it is of some considerable significance that they did not, particularly where the principal target of their proposed defence is Corbetts' claim. Furthermore, it will be apparent from the recounting of the history of this matter earlier in these reasons, that prior to the making of the subject application for leave to amend, there had been protracted litigation in the Federal Court proceedings and in these proceedings involving challenges to the jurisdiction to the
Federal Court to the transfer of the proceedings and to the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain these proceedings - a course which was persisted in through to 30 September 1996 when leave to appeal to the High Court form the
Full Court decision was refused. This protracted litigation has no doubt imposed considerable demands upon the owners and it is my view that they should not be exposed to the risk of having their claims defeated in these proceedings by a defence based upon <case>(1CA) leaving them to the completely unacceptable alternative of initiating, at their own cost, proceedings at law.
To the extent that, in whole or in part, any of the owners' claims at law would be now statute barred having regard to the passage of time since the institution of the Federal Court proceedings, in my opinion, that is all the more reason for refusing leave to amend to permit the respondents to rely upon the time limitations of <case>(1CA).

K. Owners Loss or Damage - Introductory 
The approach I have adopted in the assessment of the owners' loss or damage has been to address all of those items put in issue by the respondents during final addresses. Where items of damage have not been so put in issue I make no reference to them unless it is necessary to refer to them in some other context. In making no reference to such items it should be assumed that the item has been allowed in full unless noted in the claim as withdrawn.
The Corbetts 
Item 1, Paid to Collings $20,128: The Venture group submit that Venture cannot be liable for moneys paid by the owners to Collings Construction. For the reasons given earlier that submission is rejected and this item of claim is allowed.

Item 2, Paid to Venture Industries $239,779,18: Venture raised the Ruxley defence under this head of claim. That has been addressed earlier in these reasons.

Item 3: Venture's submission failed to pick up that this item was deleted.

Item 4, Lease of Container $2,929.91: This item of claim refers to the costs of leasing a container to hold salvaged items from the defective works whilst in the stage of rectification and rebuilding. The respondents do not challenge that item of cost rather it is submitted that it should only be allowed if some credit is brought to account for the value of salvaged items, some or all of which were retained in the subject works. The question of salvaged items has something of a history in that the referee was ordered to report on the question, namely "what amounts (if any) were received by or on behalf of any of (the named owners) for material salvaged other than in rebuilding the house or rebuilding defects?". That question was included in the order for reference at the behest of the respondents. It was answered by the referee as follows: "On the basis of the evidence given, no amounts were received by any of the listed proprietors for salvaged materials". The items that were salvaged were listed by the Corbetts in exhibit 19. They number some thirteen items to which no value was attributed. No evidence has been led by the respondents as to the value of those items. When exhibit 19 was tendered it was admitted subject to relevance in the following ruling: "HIS HONOUR: Counsel on behalf of the defendants tenders a list of items prepared by Mr Corbett setting out those items in the faultily constructed residence which required demolition and which were re-used in the reconstruction of his premises. As part of the reference in this matter questions of salvage were referred to the referee and it appears from his report that he was unable to make a finding about that question due to the fact, presumably, that no evidence was placed before him by any party.

Without making any further comment than this, it seems to me that it was open to any party to adduce evidence of any salvage value of the demolished premises and plainly the Venture group elected not to embark on that exercise.
It is now sought to be tendered material that goes to that issue.

One of the things that concerns me in dealing with this tender is in relation to the actual cost incurred by Mr Corbett in carrying out rectification work, a sum which I am told greatly exceeded the reasonable cost of rectification found by the referee. I won't go into the reasons for that. It may be that this has some bearing on an issue raised by the tendering of the actual costs and I propose to admit it, subject to relevance." (T527C.25) 
Having regard to the basis upon which I consider the Corbetts to be entitled to loss or damage which excludes the actual cost to them of reconstructing their residence and having regard to the manner in which this issue was dealt with before the referee, I do not think it is open to the respondents to seek to bring to account in the assessment of the Corbetts' loss or damage the value of any salvaged items. That was an issue which bears upon the cost of rectification, including rebuilding, of the Corbetts' home. It is clear that the respondents saw fit not to adduce any evidence before the referee in support of a case that rectification costs should take account of salvaged items. As a consequence the respondents are bound by the findings in the varied report as to the reasonable cost of rectification, which, I emphasise, was considerably less than the actual cost incurred by the Corbetts. In those circumstances I am not persuaded that the contents of exhibit 19 are relevant to any remaining issues in these proceedings and, in particular, that some allowance should be made for the value of salvaged items in the assessment of the loss or damage suffered by the Corbetts within the meaning of <case>.

Item 5: The same comments apply as applied to item 3.

Item 7:, Rental at 5 Langmead Road, Silverdale, $12,253.55: The respondents concede entitlement of the Corbetts to the reasonable cost of rental for a period of time "that it would reasonably have taken them to have had the house demolished and a new house built". It was submitted that there was "no evidence of what that period of time would be". I have some difficulty with that submission. The evidence of Corbett was that the rectification works were in fact ongoing at the time of hearing and greatly exceeded fifty-two weeks, that being the period of the claimed rental. There is no doubt that the actual reconstruction exceeded fifty-two weeks and the only matter put to Corbett was in the following cross-examination: "Q. Had you had a builder rebuild this house, would the rebuilding have run for a year? 
A. I don't know." (T528.54) 
There is, I think, ample evidence to support the reasonableness of the claim of fifty-two weeks. The actual performance of works by Venture occupied a period from 26 October 1990 to 18 December 1991 and, if one were to accept that an allowance should be made in the period of rectification for the retention of the slab constructed by Venture, I think it is reasonable to infer that the period of fifty-two weeks is a reasonable basis for this rental claim having regard to the extent of rebuilding required.

Item 8 (ii), Beresford Building Report, $1,933.75: It is not contested that the Corbetts incurred the subject fee of Beresford. The contention on behalf of Venture is that there is no evidence as to the reasonableness of this charge. I take the view that the way in which these proceedings were conducted, in the absence of any challenge to these items in cross-examination or in the respondents' case to the reasonableness of this cost, the respondent should be taken as not having put that matter in issue. In any event the subject account has been paid and there is ample evidence of inspections and of reporting thereon by Beresford sufficient for me to infer that the account was a reasonable cost of the work performed by Beresford and should be brought to account in the assessment of the Corbetts' loss or damage.

Item 9, Kneebone Beretta & Hall Reports, $928: It is not disputed that the costs of these consultant engineers was incurred nor that those costs were reasonable. They amount to $928. It is submitted however, that those were costs incurred by the Corbetts in relation to structural works which were not required to be rectified. In my opinion, having regard to the deplorable performance of the work by Venture, this submission falls into the category of courageous. It is a matter of considerable surprise that there was any element of the works which did not require demolition. Accordingly it should be taken into account as part of the Corbetts' loss or damage.

Item 10, Haines Engineering - Engineers Report, $150: There is no dispute that this cost was incurred nor that it was a reasonable cost. The amount claimed was $150! It is submitted that the cost was "part of the reconstruction costs and should have been dealt with at the reference". The evidence of the
Corbetts was that the engineer was engaged "to inspect the slab ... and supply a certificate" in about October 1993. If it is correct to treat it as a cost of rectification then clearly it cannot be allowed in addition to the reasonable costs of rectification as found in the varied report. However, I am of the opinion that it is not appropriate to classify the cost in that way, rather than as one required for the purposes of the Corbetts, possibly to obtain appropriate certification of compliance from the local responsible authority. Alternatively one may look at it as a prudent course taken by the
Corbetts to ensure that the subject rectification works were structurally sufficient notwithstanding the retention of the structural elements constructed by Venture. On that basis it is my view that the amount should be allowed.

Item 11 Legal Costs Astley Thompson & Valtas $17,254.30: Counsel on behalf of Venture, in written submissions, attempted an analysis of this account to dissect from it so much of the account as was submitted to be unrelated to the claim by the Corbetts upon the council. This was done on the basis that there should be an allowance made in the assessment of loss or damage in these proceedings for the payment received by the Corbetts of $125,000, in which event it was accepted that some allowance should be made for the costs incurred by the Corbetts in making that claim. Initially it was suggested that $15,757.30 was a reasonable assessment of costs associated with the council claim. However, in later submissions Venture suggested that approximately $10,000 could be treated as not associated with the Council claim and this assessment was accepted by the Commission. Having regard to the details of the account and to the approach I have adopted in relation to the council payment,
I think it is appropriate to limit that claim to $10,000.

Item 12: This is in the same category as item 3.

Item 14 Wollondilly Council copying of plans, $18.00: Incurring of the cost is not disputed nor the reasonableness of it. They were costs incurred in copying the plans for submission to the Australian Government Solicitors presumably for the purpose of these proceedings. Presumably the Commission will reimburse the Corbetts and include this item of expense in any order for costs made in these proceedings. In line with rulings that follow in these reasons, those costs should be disallowed.

Item 15, Carpet destroyed, $12,660: It is submitted on behalf of Venture that approximately 60 per cent only of the value of the carpets was lost to the
Corbetts. The evidence does not justify that reduction. The evidence was as follows: "Q. Of the carpets referred to in item 15, you have saved about 40 per cent? 
A. That is correct.

Q. So I take it you do not seek to recover the full $12,660? 
A. No. 40 per cent to 50 per cent is laid and I said it is only temporary. It is only just there so we can live in the house to get out of rent. It is just no good. When we relaid the carpets in the first house, all the rooms were out of square so all the carpets had to be cut and have pieces joined into them and so you have got faded pieces joining and you can see all the joints. It is only there, it is only laid in as a temporary measure.

Q. You refer to the carpets being unavoidably destroyed, what do you mean by unavoidably destroyed? 
A. Well, when they were rolled up, they had to be cut because you can't install them.

Q. Was that in the original laying? 
FAWLKNER (sic): I object. The witness should be permitted to answer.

JACOBS: Sorry.

WITNESS: They were cut and rolled and installed in the shed and when they were in the shed they got wet and just rotted, being stored for that amount of time in a shed, in a steel shed.

JACOBS: Q. I see, so what in fact affected the carpet was the subsequent storage, is that what I understand you are saying? 
A. Oh no, and as well, the house was so far out of square that I had to cut the carpets so much and there were just joins all over the place. There were rot marks in the carpet where it had been stored in the shed for 12 months and it had all deteriorated and faded.

Q. The point I put to you now is that if you had taken care to store these carpets properly, would they still have rotted? 
A. I don't know." (T529.25 - 530.11) 
In re-examination the matter was taken a step further in the following evidence: "FAWLKNER (sic): Q. Mr Corbett, as to the carpet you said that you had used part of the carpet again in the house, these are only temporary so that we could get into the house. Why was it necessary, Mr Corbett, to put the carpet down to enable you to get into the house? 
A. Well, we wanted to get out of renting for one thing and that was the only way that we were allowed to move back into the house if we had some coverings down.

Q. Who would have prevented you from moving into the house? 
A. The Wollondilli (sic) Council." (T532.12) 
Quite clearly the carpet should have no value attributed to it and the total amount of the carpet cost claimed should be allowed.

Item 16 Fireplace destroyed, $2,595: Item 17, Flyscreens destroyed $600: Item , Insulation bats destroyed, $1,367.30: Item 19, Western red cedar door destroyed $1,056.47: The only issue raised in relation to these items goes to the question of the time limitations under the Act in respect of which I have refused leave to amend. Each of the items should be included in the subject loss or damage of the Corbetts.

Item A, cost to demolish rebuild and rectify as found by referee, $213,400 and
Item B less (I) Construction price agreed with Collings $173,674 and (ii) reasonable Collings fee $3,437: Against the cost of demolition/rectification and rebuilding as found in the varied report should be allowed the contract price as structured by Collings Construction and as it was understood by the respective owners.

In the case of the Corbetts, the sum stated as the contract price in the second quotation and the second summary together with the second work additionals totalling $173,674, represents the contract price which, in my opinion, should be taken into account in allowing for the represented price for the works.

One final adjustment requires to be made to allow for any value in the design work provided by Collings Construction and the expenses incurred by it on behalf of the Corbetts. The Commission led evidence that the reasonable fee for this design work was $3,437. I think it is clear from the evidence that the value of the services and the expenses incurred by Collings Construction exceeded that amount. The Commission adduced the evidence of Mark Frederick
Sheldon (Sheldon) in relation to this issue. Sheldon is a registered chartered architect, a fellow of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (the RAIA) and a director of Gazard Sheldon Pty Ltd with extensive architectural experience in relation to the design and construction of a variety of projects, including residential buildings. In general terms it could be said that his evidence was scathing in the opinions which he expressed as to the standard of the design services provided by Collings Construction. Generally he viewed the level of fees charged by Collings Construction as grossly excessive.

There was called on behalf of the Collings group Grant Kenneth Shearer , who also was a registered chartered architect. He held a licence under the BSC Act, and practised both as architect and builder. In general terms, he supported the charges made by Collings Construction and in doing so placed reliance upon the fact that the fees charged by Collings Construction included reimbursement for significant expenses incurred in the nature of fees to local authorities. He also placed emphasis on the fact that, as a project home marketer, Collings Construction faced significant overheads related, in part, to the provision and maintenance of display homes. He did not regard it as of particular significance that the fees were charged and, in part, performed by an organisation that was not formally qualified in the provision of architectural services.

Again, addressing the matter generally, I think there is considerable difficulty in accepting the evidence of Shearer when some comparison is made between the RAIA fee guide and the percentage which the fees charged by
Collings Construction bore to the contract price. Further, in my opinion, the contract documentation itself was crude and as I have found quite confusing, extremely misleading and deficient in significant respects. Sheldon added to that opinion by describing Collings Construction's work as generally "shabby and inadequate".

In the opinion of Sheldon the appropriate percentage for full architectural services proffered in the RAIA guide should be about 8.75 per cent of the contract price - that being the appropriate percentage "for simple building works of around $100,000". (However, I note in another section of his evidence he has used 9.75 per cent). That percentage included contract administration.
The same guide suggested 65 per cent of total fee as an applicable percentage for design and documentation stage. Even allowing for the inclusion in the
Collings Construction charges of amounts which would not normally be included in the design and documentation element of architectural services, it is clear that the charges made by Collings Construction for its design services greatly exceeded a fee that would be yielded by the application of the percentages to contract price to which I have just referred. I have no doubt that the general approach adopted by Sheldon is the correct approach to the determination of the reasonable value of the services provided and expenses incurred by
Collings Construction in relation to the owners' contracts.

In the case of the Corbetts' residential building Sheldon was of the opinion that: "The design (modified floor plan and elevations), could be worked out in one to two days by a professional architect and the documentation prepared within two days." 
It was the opinion of Sheldon that: "The cost to produce the modified drawings from the standard design by either an architect or a drafting service should be in the range of $1,000 to $3,000.
If a royalty in respect of an original design were also applicable, this would add between $500 and $1,500 for this type of house." 
The initial evaluation by Sheldon in his report of 30 November 1993 was modified during his oral evidence as follows: "Reasonable fees by an architect or draftsman (service).
 * engineers, surveyor, BA and $2,000 authorities fees, BSC and disbursements * meetings, sketches adjustment $3,000 of base house plans, preparation of specification, coordination of surveyor and engineer, lodgement of BA * house royalty fee $1,500 * * Total reasonable fee for service $6,500 (Exhibit BJ, pars 5 and 6) 
In her affidavit of 17 October 1995 (Exhibit D1-22) J Collings evidenced that, in relation to the Corbetts' contract, expenses which included engineer's fees, those of the surveyor, certain levies and other fees paid to local authorities totalled $1,937. Presumably, these are the expenses of the kind for which Sheldon has allowed $2,000. In my opinion, the fees and charges as assessed by Sheldon are the reasonable fees and charges which should be allowed in respect of the work performed and expenses incurred by Collings
Construction in relation to the Corbetts' contract. The opinion of Shearer that there should be some allowance of approximately $3,000 to reflect the particular costs incurred by a marketer of project homes I think has been accommodated in Sheldon's allowance of "house royalty fee". The sum to be allowed then is $6,500.

There only remains the claim for damages for vexation or aggravated damages and I propose to deal with that aspect of the Corbetts' claim in a separate segment of these reasons dealing with such claims on behalf of other owners.
The Quaglias 
The Quaglias refused to enter into contractual arrangements with Venture in the circumstances examined earlier in these reasons. While there is no doubt that Venture was in the process of treating the Quaglias in much the same reprehensible fashion meted out to the other owners, the fact remains that financial circumstances drove the Quaglias to turn their backs on the efforts of Venture to deceive them. I think the payment by the Quaglias to Collings
Construction should be distinguished from the liability of Venture for payments made by the owners to Collings Construction. The fact that Venture challenged the right of the Quaglias to terminate any arrangement with
Venture: that Venture sought to force its stand upon the Quaglias by the lodgment of a caveat on the title of the Ermington property does not advance the Commission's case, in my opinion. The basis upon which I have found
Venture liable for the payments by the other owners to Collings Construction was removed, in my opinion, in the case of the Quaglias, by this decision to terminate dealings with the respondents.

As against Collings Construction the following amounts should be included in the Quaglias' loss or damage: 
Item 1, Paid Collings Construction Pty Ltd, $12,572: It has been submitted by the Commission that no adjustment should be made to that sum on the basis that the Quaglias derived no benefit from the services performed or the expenses paid by Collings Construction in relation to the Quaglias' contract. I think that represents the correct approach to the assessment of their loss or damage. It was submitted on behalf of the Collings group that some allowance was justified on the basis that the Quaglias had used the Collings
Construction design in the construction of their residence as building owners.
Support for that submission was said to be found in the cross-examination of
Quaglias which is set out below: "Q. How similar is the design that you have built for yourself to the
Louisiana that we designed for you? 
A. Functionally it is similar; layout it is not. Same number of rooms, roughly the same sizes of rooms. There is a little bit extra to it.

Q. Would you be willing to make that plan available to myself to have a look at? 
A. For what reason? 
Q. I would like to compare it to the Louisiana floor plan to see how different it is? 
A. Are you suggesting I am in breach of copyright? 
Q. No. I am wondering whether you will make it available, that is all, to the court and to myself.

A. I see no reason why I can't. It won't assist you in any way." (T560.24 -.41) 
Following that cross-examination, arrangements were agreed to by Quaglia to produce the subject plan to Collings Construction. The matter was not further addressed on behalf of the Collings group and, in my opinion, the evidence above quoted is no justification for the assertion that the Collings
Construction design was used by the Quaglias. Accordingly, I make no allowance for any alleged benefit derived by the Quaglias from the work performed or the expenditure incurred by Collings Construction in relation to the Quaglias' contract. In relation to expenses incurred in the payment of council's fees I note that the council approval obtained by Collings Construction lapsed.

Item 3, Borrowing Expenses, $2,184.83: It has been submitted that the Quaglias committed themselves to the subject loan prior to entering into binding commitments to proceed with the construction of their proposed residence: that the form of contract executed by the Quaglias with the special conditions removed could not have been regarded by them as a binding commitment: that the period during which the loan was on foot was extended by reason of changes in the subject plans required by the Quaglias, in part, to obtain council approval. As I have found earlier in these reasons the evidence disclosed that the loan monies were required by the Quaglias in order to make the payments then being demanded by Collings Construction. The evidence disclosed that the bank charges dated from 2 April 1991, that being the date when the sum of $10,572 was paid by the Quaglias to Collings Construction. In my opinion, there is no justification for writing down the amount of costs incurred by the
Quaglias by way of borrowing charges given the findings that they would not have entered into any arrangement with Collings Construction had they been aware of the true position concerning the nature of the proposal offered by
Collings Construction, including the role to be played by Collings
Construction in the construction of their residential building.

Item 4, Travel Expenses, $1,120: There are a number of unsatisfactory aspects of this element of claim. By way of example, it is not based not upon actual costs but on estimated costs which Quaglia had been informed were estimates adopted by the Commissioner for Taxation in relation to the assessment of motor vehicle expenses of taxpayers: they related in part to matters that preceded any contractual arrangement with Collings Construction. Approximately half of the amount claimed related to the period 1 July 1990 to 30 June 1991.
The Quaglias had determined not to proceed with the arrangement made with
Collings Construction as at 7 May 1991, yet some $430 in travelling expenses are claimed for the period 1 July 1992 to 30 June 1994, with something like $30 being claimed for the period 1 July 1991 to 30 June 1992. Included amongst the items of claim are travel expenses in attending to payment of an account and to deliver a letter. Another item relates to travel expenses in attending a meeting for the purpose of obtaining an affidavit. Other items, particularly from 19 September 1992, relate to the Quaglias' involvement in the
Misadventure Club. For the reasons that I have earlier given, any benefit from participation in that group's activities should not be taken into account in any assessment of the Quaglias' loss or damage. That approach would operate to disallow costs incurred in deriving that benefit. I think a proportion of the costs to June 1991 are allowable and I think approximately one third of those would be a reasonable assessment which I have rounded to $200.

Item 5, Misadventure Club, $10,380: In my opinion these costs are not recoverable for the reasons I have given for excluding any benefits to the owners from their participation in the activities of the Misadventure Club.
The Staps 
Item 1, Paid Collings Construction Pty Ltd, $12,000 and Item 2, Paid Venture
Industries Pty Ltd, $82,118.34: For the reasons earlier given, these items should be included in the assessment of the loss or damage for which the respondents, including Venture, should be held liable.

Item 3, Paid Building Consultant, $3,232.50: There is no dispute that some amount should be allowed in respect of this item of claim. It was submitted on behalf of Venture that some reasonable allowance should be made on a "broad brush approach" (T1174 and 1175). In the written submissions of Venture it was also put that, since some of these fees were incurred in support of the claim against the Corporation, it was not open to the Commission to claim that portion of the fees while denying to the respondents the right to have the
Corporation payment taken into account. For this latter submission Venture relied upon a report (part of exhibit BS) of an inspector for the Corporation which under the heading "INSURANCE DETAILS" recorded the notification of an intention by the Staps through their "CONSULTANT MR J BERESFORD" to proceed with a claim for certain defects and overcharging. The fees are described by
Stap as having been incurred pursuant to a retainer of Beresford in March of "to carry out inspections and to prepare a report to assist ..." the
Staps in their dispute with Venture. It may be that some work was performed by
Beresford in assisting the Staps in their claim for insurance payment under the Corporation insurance scheme. However, there is nothing before me that evidences that the fees sought to be recovered relate to any such work by
Beresford and the submission takes no account of the evidence of Stap referred to above. There was no cross-examination of Stap to suggest that the fees charged by Beresford were other than reasonable and there is no basis, in my opinion, for taking the "broad brush approach" advanced by Venture to reduce the amount of these fees in the assessment of the Staps' loss or damage.

Item 4, Engineer Consultant, $400: Similar considerations apply to this item as to the preceding items and in my opinion the amount is properly included in the Staps' loss or damage calculation.

Item 5, Borrowing Expenses, $28,295.64: In respect of the claim for $3,420.64 it was submitted on behalf of Venture that against this penalty cost there should be set off the profit made by the Staps in the sale of the Dural property. The profit was calculated by Venture on the basis that the property was sold for $256,000, a price which could be compared with the amount of approximately $235,000 made up of the total of payments to Collings
Construction and Venture and the cost of rectification. Additionally, it was submitted the Staps received $100,000 under the Corporation insurance scheme and $37,500 pursuant to the Staps' deed. For the reasons given, those lastmentioned amounts should not be taken into account in the assessment of the Staps' loss or damage under <case>. I am of the opinion that the claim for this penalty interest should not be defeated by setting off against it the alleged profit on sale of the Dural property. In my opinion, whether the proceeds of sale resulted in a profit or loss is a matter of irrelevance in calculating any entitlement to recoupment of penalty interest incurred by the
Staps. However, I consider the claim of the Staps fails because of the view I have taken of the relevance of the sale of the Dural property to any aspect of the loss or damage suffered by the Staps. The evidence of the Staps was that the sale was brought about because of the "stress, harassment and threats which had been made to (them) by employees of Venture industries while we lived there and particularly in the period of rectification from 6 June 1992 to 15 July 1992 and the harassing telephone calls which commenced in December and continued right up until we left (the Dural property)". While I have reached the conclusion that the behaviour of Venture during performance of the rectification work involved complete indifference to the convenience of the
Staps and was intimidatory in nature and, further, that P Kioussis was involved in an act of vandalism involving the Staps residence at the end of that rectification period, I am unable to be satisfied that the telephone calls to which the Staps refer were made by Venture. While I have no reason to doubt the veracity of the Staps evidence as to their reason for disposing of the Dural property I am not satisfied that the disposal of the property and the costs incurred in respect of that sale should be regarded as having been caused by the contraventions of Venture. At the same time I think it is open to me to take into account the conduct of the Venture group at the time of the purported performance of the subject works in considering the question of damages for vexation or aggravated damages, regarding that conduct as endemic to the real nature of Venture as a building organisation.. In my opinion, the costs associated with the disposal of the Dural property should be excluded from the assessment of the Staps' loss or damage. Accordingly the amount of penalty interest should be excluded from the Staps' loss or damage assessment.

In an "additional note" counsel for Venture further challenged the balance of borrowing expenses claimed as being excessive. The subject of this claim was barely touched upon in cross-examination (T312, 316-7) and I am not persuaded to further reduce the amount claimed having regard to the evidence in chief of
Stap (exhibit R, par 5).

Item 7, Rental Paid, $8,820: This claim relates to the rental paid by the
Staps upon leaving the Dural property and until September 1993 when they acquired other accommodation. During this period the reconstruction work was performed which was necessary to rectify Venture's defective works. While this rectification work was being performed the builder performing that work occupied the Dural property. It was submitted on behalf of Venture that this claim falls into the same category as the claim for costs and expenses involved in the sale of the Dural property in June 1993. It was argued that "the Staps may have the right to recover damages of this type in some other action" but not under <case> of the Act. It was further submitted that, in any event, it had not been established that the forty-nine weeks in respect of which this claim for reimbursement of rental was made was evidenced to be a reasonable period for the performance of the rectification works. There is no doubt that the removal of the Staps from the Dural property was influenced by their fear of Venture. However, it does not follow that the period during which reimbursement of rental is claimed was the result of that concern. I think one can infer from the Staps' need to store furniture during the period of rectification work and from the evidence of the costs of reconstruction of approximately $115,500 that the works of rectification were major and that it was reasonable for the Staps to be absent from the Dural property during the performance of those reconstruction works. In my opinion, that is the proper inference to be made. However, it is clear that those rectification works had been completed by June of 1993 when the sale of the Dural property took place.
Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the Staps are entitled to reimbursement for rental paid for a period representing the reasonable period of reconstruction which I have estimated to be the period from October 1992 to the end of February 1993. I have made this estimate on the basis that, since the contracts for the sale of the Dural property were exchanged on 5 May 1993, after allowing for some reasonable period to affect the sale of the property, it is likely that the reconstruction works were completed before April 1993.
Further, by having regard to the fact that the cost of the reconstruction works was found in the varied report to be $115,502 and after allowing for the disruption to such works occasioned by the Christmas period shut down, a reconstruction period from October 1992 to some time in the first quarter of would seem reasonable. However, in his evidence in chief, Stap timed the construction period as ending in February 1993. Accordingly, there should be allowed rental reimbursement at the rate of $180 per week from 20 October 1992 until 28 February 1993, a period of 18 weeks, giving a total of $3,240.

Item 8, Storage Fees, $512: The evidence of the claim for storage of furniture after the Staps "moved from house into unit and prior to moving into new house" is unsatisfactory.

It will be noted that the total of the amount claimed is incorrect and that the claim is for $312. The evidence of that storage is to be found in exhibit
R which included three receipts of Millers Self Storage dated respectively 7
February 1992, 16 March 1993 and 12 April 1992, not 12 April 1993 as referred to in the particulars submitted by the Commission. Those receipts for 1992 cover a period from 10 February to 12 April presumably 1992, a period of eight weeks. Of the $312, $30 was in the nature of a deposit, so that the average weekly rental was approximately $35. The anomaly is not explained by treating the dates shown on the receipts as erroneously referring to the year 1992 instead of the year 1993 as the date 7 February in the latter year was a
Sunday. I am unable to relate the period of the receipts to the period the subject of the claim. Had I been able to do so the weekly rate could have been applied to that period. No allowance should be made for this item.

Item 9, Removalists, $260: For the reasons given for the rejection of the penalty interest claim this head of damage should not be allowed.

Item 13: It was submitted on behalf of Venture that these charges should not be allowed and with that submission I agree. The evidence of Stap in support of this head of claim was as follows: "As a result of my dispute with the First and Third Defendants I have incurred $786.00 in telephone calls with respect to a mobile phone which was used to carry out discussions with the Third Defendant and other. This was in the period from February 1992 to April 1992 when we were living in a caravan and in order to communicate it was necessary to use a mobile telephone." (Exhibit R, Item 13) 
In cross-examination by counsel for Collings Stap gave the following evidence: "Q. Yes, telephone charges. You say there (sic) as a result of your dispute with the first and third defendants you have incurred $786 in telephone calls - you say that is from the period February 1992 to April 1992. I suggest to you that there were virtually no - very few telephone calls that you made or attempted to make to Collings during that period? 
A. That is true.

Q. Do you agree with that? 
A. Yes.

Q. Those telephone calls were currently made during that period because you didn't have a telephone service connected to the caravan, is that right? 
A. That is correct." (T299.17 - .31) 
There were undoubtedly telephone calls made by Stap, the cost of which was incurred in relation to the Staps' contractual arrangements with Collings
Construction and Venture. There has been no attempt to dissect or otherwise identify those costs and I am not disposed to attempt a dissection of the particulars to isolate what may be a comparatively insignificant portion of costs which could be included in the Staps loss or damage.

Item 14, Lost Salary, $9,467.72: The evidence of Stap in support of this claim was as follows: "(i) In order to attend various meetings with the Third Defendant and also those advising me with respect to my dispute with the Third Defendant I was absent from work for a total of 41 days and consequently lost $4,592.00 in salary. Annexed and marked "JPGS9" is a letter from the Department of
Community Services dated 30 September 1992 particularising the days that I was absent.

As a result of the dispute with the Third Defendant it was also necessary for my wife to be absent from her employment in order to attend various meetings and conferences and she incurred a loss of salary of $4,763.72.
Annexed and marked "JPGS10" is a copy of a letter from Baulkham Hills
Private Hospital dated 30 September 1992 advising of the loss of salary." (Exhibit R, Item 14) 
The annexures there referred to disclose that in the case of Stap he was paid sick leave and annual leave as follows: "Sick leave Annual leave /3/92 - 23/3/92 3 days 27/3/92 - 27/4/92 19 days /7/92 - 16/7/92 5 days 22/7/92 - 27/9/92 4 days /8/92 - 24/8/92 4 days 23/8/92 - 31/8/92 5 days /9/92 - 23/9/92 1 day 
Total 12 days 29 days" (Exhibit R, Annexure JPGS9) 
In the case of N Stap the letter of the hospital dated 30 September 1992 evidenced the fact that "since February 1992" N Stap had been paid for eleven days of sick leave and sixteen days of annual leave making a total of $4, .72. There was very little cross-examination in respect of this matter beyond seeking to establish that, in the case of attendances on Collings
Construction, there were very few attendances involved and to establish that there had been no loss of income as those leave periods were paid for by the employers of the Staps. However, the Commission pressed on behalf of the Staps the value of this leave payment as a head of claim on the basis that it represented a loss of entitlement to leave. It was submitted on behalf of
Venture that: 
The sick leave could not have been legitimately taken by the Staps for the purpose described in the evidence, 
The time lost by a litigant in consulting his solicitor in respect of litigation is not a recoverable expense, 
Since the Staps had been paid for the leave taken there was no loss, 
In any event, the claimed loss of time, in part, related to preparation of arbitration proceedings which had been instituted against the Staps by
Venture.

I think it is also reasonably clear that some of the lost time involved attendances upon Russo at a time when the Staps were a member of the
Misadventure Club.

In support of this claim on behalf of the Staps the Commission submitted that the claim accorded with the reasoning of the Full court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in North versus Thompson [[1971] WAR 103.] That case is authority for the proposition that wages lost during a period of incapacity may be calculated without deduction for recreational leave paid during the period of incapacity. It was submitted that a similar consideration applied to sick leave, referring to Parker versus The Commonwealth of Australia [(1975) 49
ALJR 221] where, in respect of a period of lost wages, the plaintiff had received sick leave payments. I regard both of those authorities as of little assistance in considering the submissions of counsel for Venture.

In my view, time taken in connection with the Staps' efforts to recover payments under the Corporation insurance scheme, or in participating in the activities of the Misadventure Club in instructing Russo to enable them to secure further payments by the Corporation, or to act in the mediation that preceded the settlement with the Corporation and in similar activities concerned with preparing their case against Venture in the arbitration instituted against them by Venture, should not be included in the assessment of their loss or damage.

Having regard to my reasons for excluding from consideration the payments received from the Corporation both under the insurance scheme and by way of settlement, it follows, in my opinion, that costs incurred in pursuing those payments should be excluded from the assessment of the Staps' loss or damage.

Similarly, in the case of the loss represented by their involvement in the preparation of their defence in the arbitration brought against them by
Venture, I think any such entitlement should be left to recovery at the hands of the arbitrator appointed in that matter. This view is reinforced by the undertaking to the Court on behalf of Venture to bring those arbitration proceedings to an end and to make no further claim against the Staps in those proceedings. In those circumstances, on those facts alone, there could be no justification in the arbitrator refusing to award the Staps their legitimate costs of those proceedings.

There has been no attempt to break down this claim for the value of lost time to permit me to make an assessment of the cost to the Staps represented by their lost entitlement to leave through their attendances upon Venture during the performance of the works. In any event, I doubt if those attendances would justify a significant allowance when it is considered that attendances on
Venture could have been affected at times which would not have required a loss of a days employment or leave. Moreover, the way in which that leave was taken showed that there were quite significant blocks of time which I think could not be said to be related to attendances on Venture. I make no observation on the use of entitlements to sick leave to attend to matters of dispute with
Venture other than to state that the authorities to which I have been referred in my opinion do not assist me.

If one examines the evidence in chief of Stap as to his attendances on Venture or on consultants concerning the subject works in the period of his sick leave and annual leave from 18 March to 27 April 1992, a period of twenty-two days, there is nothing in that material beyond a day or two which could be said to have been taken up in meetings of that kind. In the circumstances I am unable to make any reasonable estimate of any value of leave lost in the manner evidenced by Stap which should be allowed as part of the Staps' loss or damage.

Item 15, Travel Expenses, $2,933: This item of claim has similar problems to those raised under item 14, with the added observation that, in line with the
Quaglias' claim, the expenses have been estimated on what the Staps had been informed was a rate for motor vehicle expenses acceptable to the Commissioner of Taxation. It is not supported by any record of costs. It involved attendances upon the solicitors for the Commission in connection with the preparation by the Commission for these proceedings. In my opinion, those last mentioned costs should not be treated as caused by the proscribed conduct of the respondents. If costs have been incurred by the Commission in the course of that preparation which includes the costs of witnesses attending on conferences, then it may be that those costs will be recoverable in an appropriate order for costs in these proceedings. Whether that be so, I am firmly of the opinion that such estimated costs should not treated as recoverable as loss or damage under <case> of the Act. They are expenses incurred in the pursuit of proceedings under <case>.

Similarly, in relation to expenses claimed for the period from 15 January 1992 to 3 October 1992, that being the whole of the period in 1992 in respect of which travel expenses were claimed, I note that none of the days, other than August 1992, fall within the periods of lost leave entitlements when it is said Stap was engaged in attendances on those advising him in the matter. (I note that the date 28/4/92 in the schedule of costs evidenced by Stap in support of this claim should read 28/4/93. I also note that in the period prior to 15 January 1992 the schedule appears to contain further typographical errors which I am unable to resolve).

Similarly, I assume that these attendances to which I have last referred include attendances in pursuit of claims under the Corporation insurance scheme, claims through the Misadventure Club and on their own behalf against the Corporation. The schedule set out travel expenses said to have been incurred months before there was any contractual commitment to Collings
Construction or before there was any likelihood of such a contractual relationship being entered into. There are trips involving delivery of documents which one would have thought might have been easily affected by resort to the postal services available. As in the case of the salary claim, I am far from satisfied as to the content of any legitimate claim for expenses which would be properly allowed in the assessment of the Staps' loss or damage and, having regard to the state of that evidence, I decline to make any such allowance.

Item 16, Expenses: Sale of Caber Close House, $7,897: For the reason earlier given this item is disallowed.

Item 17, Legal Costs (Solicitor Only - No Counsel's Fees Claimed), $11,402:
For the reasons earlier stated, costs amounted to $4,683 relating to the
Staps' arbitration should be rejected. Similar observations apply to the costs of the caveat lodged by Venture on the Dural property ($352). Those costs should be left to the Court having jurisdiction in such matters. The costs in relation to the Corporation insurance claim ($882), as I have previously stated, should not be brought to account. I also take the view that costs incurred in "representations" seeking legal aid and in relation to the taking of police action ($1,718) are independently incurred costs which should not be treated as caused by the proscribed conduct of the respondents. The arbitration costs have been dissected by Russo (exhibit CO) from his invoices ,480 and 577, and the other categories from invoice 289. It is from this last mentioned invoice that Russo dissected the fees representing the balance of the claim for legal fees, namely $550 for "Collings issues" and $3217 for "Building and construction issues". Given the detailed nature of this dissection, I think it is reasonable to conclude that this balance of the costs claim, which relate to services rendered from 7 May 1992, have been incurred as the result of the general construction problems which confronted the Staps and are separate from other discrete areas such as the costs of arbitration. There has been no challenge to the reasonableness of Russo's rates to the effect that they were unnecessarily incurred. In my opinion they should be allowed in the sum of $3,767.

Item 18, Less, $93,926.97: I have found that the Staps were misled into believing that the contract price of $92,000 was a firm price for the subject works. That sum should be brought to account in allowing the sum of $115,502 for rectification and rebuilding costs as found in the varied report.

In respect of the services provided by Collings Construction, the evidence lead by the Commission was that a reasonable value for that work and expenses incurred by Collings Construction was $1,926.97. The issues raised by the parties are similar to those considered in relation to the Corbetts' contract.
Shearer estimated that a reasonable value of the services provided, including $1,600 for the outgoings and $3,000 to cover the costs of project home marketing, was in the sum of $15,118. By comparison Sheldon valued those services and the expenses incurred at $4,500. The affidavit of J Collings of 8
March 1995 (exhibit D1-41) identified $1,676.97 as outgoings incurred by
Collings Construction in connection with the services rendered by it to the
Staps. For these expenses Sheldon allowed $2,000 . Of the standard of services provided by Collings Construction Sheldon regarded the description of those services as "design and documentation of new home" as "grossly misleading". He regarded the subject brochure drawings and documentation as "shabby and inadequate". I have little doubt that the estimated value placed by Sheldon upon the work performed and expenses incurred by Collings Construction is a reasonable estimate. Accordingly the sum of $4,500 should be allowed.
The Smiths 
Item 1. Paid Collings Construction Pty Ltd, $14,233 and Item 2, Paid Venture
Industries Pty Ltd, $38,828: My earlier findings cover these claims.

Item 3, Paid Building Consultants, $5,008: Venture submits that there is insufficient evidence to establish the reasonableness of such a fee "allegedly paid" and for which there was no "supporting document or invoice". There is no foundation for those submissions in that the evidence of the Smiths clearly establish payment, the subject matter of the fees so incurred and I note that there was no suggestion in the cross-examination of the Smiths that the fees had not been paid or were in some respect unreasonable. The fees are recoverable subject only to one matter. The fees include $995 for "Court appearance arbitration" which, for reasons I have given should be excluded.
Accordingly there should be allowed the sum of $4,013.25 (see exhibit Z, annexure 93).

Item 8, Legal Costs, $4,937: For the reasons given for the disallowance of items of claim in the Staps' claim for legal costs, this claim should be reduced to $2,800 being the costs as dissected by Russo in relation to "Collings issues" ($400) and "Building Construction issues" ($2,400).

Item 9, Misadventure Club, $10,380 and Item 11, Arbitration, $500: These claims are covered by previous rulings and are disallowed.

Item 12, Photograph Costs, $737: The evidence in relation to this item of claim suggests that part was incurred in relation to claims made in respect of the Corporation insurance scheme, for the claim for payments outside of the scheme and, possibly, in respect of these proceedings. For those reasons I think this claim should be disallowed in part. I have allowed $350.

Item 13, Photocopying, $677: I think this claim falls into the same category as item 12 and should be disallowed in part. I have allowed $350.

Item 15, Telephone charges, $353: Venture does not challenge the inclusion of this head of claim but puts in issue the reasonableness of the amount claimed, submitting that it "should not exceed $200". The evidence of Smith (exhibit W) sufficiently identifies the calculation of the amount claimed and there should be allowed the sum of $353.

Item 16, Security Guard, $220: This item should be disallowed. It does not, in my opinion, relate to the respondents' contraventions.

Item 17, Lost Salary/Wages, $2,001: Much of the particulars of this claim are barely decipherable. What can be gleaned from those particulars is that for the most part they relate to proceedings to "show cause" (approximately $1,400), presumably against Venture, on attendance on the local member and site attendances. I have allowed $320 as I consider the balance has not been caused by the respondents contraventions.

Item 18, Travel Expenses (Estimate), $1,967: I think it is clear from the estimate provided (exhibit W) that included in the claim are travelling expenses incurred pre-contract, travel expenses related to arbitration, or to attendance at other tribunals, to meetings of the Misadventure Club. For the reasons I have previously given I think that the majority of such expenses should be disallowed. I have allowed the sum of $200.

Item 20, Cost to Demolish and Rebuild as Found by the Referee, $152,838: The varied report found that the reasonable cost of rectification and rebuilding of the Smiths' residence was $152,838 which included a sum of $15,000 for demolition. Venture disputed that the Smiths were entitled to recover that demolition cost, as distinct from the sum of $2,900 which, it was submitted, accorded with the amount originally particularised in the statement of claim and with the amount evidenced on behalf of the Smiths in these proceedings - referring to exhibit W. The finding of the varied report was as follows: "(a) This house was completely demolished and rebuilt by Neighbourhood
Constructions for the sum of $155,450. However the contract was entered into on the basis of rectification and completion, and was varied to full demolition and rebuilding for the same sum plus $14,591 for an increased slab which is not claimed. Other quotes for rectification and completion were obtained from Andressen: $158,725, and Major: $187,415.

I find a degree of uncertainty, arising from the switch from rectification and complete to demolish and re-build, as to the cost of the latter. Cotton has given no financial accounting concerning this, and it may well have been simply a reasonable substitution at the same price. However I do not believe it is a satisfactory basis for me to make a finding.

Daley gave an estimate of cost for demolition at $15,000, and that seems to me a reasonable figure to adopt. I believe the reasonable approach to this question, in view of the uncertainty noted in (b) above, is to apply the demolition cost to the reasonable cost found in answer to 3.1 above. The result is $152,838 ($137,838 + $15,00)." (The Referee's Report, <case>.2.3) 
Given the acceptance of a contract for "rectification and completion" in the sum of $155,450, I would have thought that that was an appropriate cost to take into account, rather than the lesser amount as found in the varied report. However, that matter was not pressed on the adoption of the report and
I am satisfied that the amount as found in the varied report is the true cost of rectification and completion. In any event, I note that the evidence to which reference has been made on behalf of Venture is not the cost of demolition but is evidence relating to cost of demolition of portion of the works.

I have found in these reasons that the represented contract price for building work, after taking into account the effect of work additionals, was $107,249.
However, I also found that Smith was aware of the likelihood of additional costs being incurred in the provision of piers. The varied report found that a reasonable builder would have included a provisional sum of $600 for this element. Venture submitted a variation claim for this work in excess of $4,000. There is no way of knowing accurately what the true additional cost may have been. I think $1,000 would be a generous adjustment bringing the total contract price to $108,249.

The area of dispute in relation to the value of services provided and expenses incurred by Collings Construction is to be found essentially in the evidence of Sheldon and Shearer with Sheldon decrying the standard of the services provided as being "brochure drawings and documentation (which) were shabby and inadequate". The issues raised in respect of the Smiths' residential building were, in principle, the same as those I have so far examined and, in my opinion, the evidence of Sheldon is to be preferred. I think an allowance of $5,000 is the appropriate allowance notwithstanding the total fee of $5,233 calculated by Sheldon in exhibit BJ. I think that sum should be reduced by the amount of $233, having regard to the level of fees and disbursements evidenced in the affidavit of J Collings (exhibit D1-22).
The Grimstons 
Item 1, Paid to Collings Construction, $12,900 and Item 2, Paid to Venture
Industries $22,610: My earlier rulings cover these heads of claim.

Item 3, Payments to Building Consultants, $4,653.50: It has been submitted on behalf of Venture that the amount of these fees was paid to the Grimstons by the Corporation. I think that is clear from exhibit AE. However, I regard that evidence of payment to be of a payment pursuant to the Corporation insurance scheme and, accordingly, allow this item on the same basis as I have treated other items of claim the subject of payments by the Corporation under the
Corporation insurance scheme. However, as to the amount of $2,441.25, it was submitted that this amount was not recoverable as it was incurred by the
Grimstons in the retainer of a consultant to supervise completion of the rectification works carried out on their behalf. I think this question is resolved by determining whether it is a cost which should be regarded as included in the reasonable costs of rectification and completion of the works as found in the varied report. I think it is clear from the findings of the varied report that this item was not taken into account - the issue before the referee apparently being limited to builder's costs. In my opinion, this amount should be allowed as a reasonable cost incurred by the Grimstons in ensuring the due performance of the rectification and completion works required.

Item 5, Legal Expenses, $607.70: I think these expenses should be disallowed.
They represent a submission of a proposal to Venture, initiated by the
Grimstons, with the view to resolving their differences with Venture. The proposal was acceptable to Venture but not pursued by the Grimstons. In those circumstances I think it is inappropriate to regard those costs as having been incurred by the contraventions of Venture.

Item 6, Legal Expenses, $1,990.20: Russo has dissected the subject invoice to isolate $1,250 in fees for "Collings issues" and "Building and Construction issues" from fees incurred in relation to claims on the corporation and other items of costs which are covered by my previous rulings. Those fees should be disallowed, leaving the balance of $1,250 recoverable.

Item 7, Misadventure Club, $10,380: This claim is covered by my previous ruling and is disallowed.

Item 8, Borrowing Expenses, $2,708.77: This is a claim for borrowing charges incurred as a result of the delay occasioned to the construction of the subject works for the Grimstons (exhibit AC par 13). It was not asserted by
Venture that these costs were incurred other than as described in the evidence of Grimston. However, it was submitted that some "saving" should be brought to account for interest costs not incurred, but which would have been incurred had the subject loan been drawn down in full as originally contemplated by the
Grimstons. In my opinion, this ,misconceives the nature of the claim which is made up mainly of "commitment interest", namely, interest charges following approval of the loan notwithstanding the Grimstons' inability to draw down the loan in full, in a timely way. The amount of $2,708.77 should be included in the assessment of the Grimstons loss or damage.

Item 9, Photographs, $42.25: It was submitted that there was difficulty in ascertaining the amount claimed under this heading. The amount of $42.25 should be allowed.

Item 10, Telephone Calls, $994: This is a claim for the cost of telephone calls made by the Grimstons during the course of their dealings with the respondents. In my opinion the evidence was quite unsatisfactory. It was stated by Grimston that he had "not kept an exact record of these (costs), but (he believed) that they would have taken up a substantial portion of (his) telephone bills". While no doubt there were some phone calls made by the
Grimstons to one or other of the respondents, I am not disposed to attempt some dissection of costs and adopt the submissions of Venture that "an allowance could possibly be made of $200". Accordingly, that sum is allowed.

Item 11, Loss of Wages (Nett), $300: This is a claim for $300 representing wages in the form of leave payments, the benefit of which was lost to Grimston by reason of his application of two days petitioning local representatives in
July 1992 in respect of the conduct of the respondents. In my opinion this sum should not be allowed as a cost occasioned by the conduct of Venture.

Item 12, Travelling Expenses, $4,785.96: The claim for travelling expenses is in similar form to that dealt with in relation to other owners and in my opinion suffers from the same deficiencies. The expenses are estimates based on some rate said to be acceptable for income tax purposes in calculating the cost of motor vehicle travel. It includes a number of visits to the exhibition homes prior to contract, travel in relation to claims upon the Corporation insurance scheme and claims against the Corporation outside of that scheme. It is taken up with extensive activities of the Misadventure Club and for the preparation of the Grimstons' claim in these proceedings. Those costs should be disallowed having regard to the approach I have adopted to the payments received by the Misadventure Club and by the Grimstons under the Corporation insurance scheme, and the approach to costs incurred in relation to these proceedings, I think it is appropriate to allow a nominal sum of $200. I note that the submissions on behalf of Venture contend that if any allowance was to be made it should not exceed $600.

Item 13, Parking Fees and Tolls, $158: These expenses are in the same category as item 12. However I decline to attempt any dissection having regard to the amount involved.

Item 14, Miscellaneous, $$1.367.65: Although this is described as a claim for interest, it amounts to a claim for the loss of the use of money over periods varying between seven and eighteen months in respect of moneys outlaid by the
Grimstons for the purchase of fittings and installations, such as water tanks, to be installed in the subject works. It was the evidence of Grimston that these items were "purchased because Wayne Collings told me to purchase items of this kind". I am not satisfied that the Grimstons were justified in making these purchases at the times set out in the schedule of claim in the evidence of Grimston (exhibit AC). Some of the items of claim date from March 1991, whereas council approval of the subject plans did not take place until
September 1991 and the first visit of the Grimstons to Venture did not take place until 14 October 1991. The claim is disallowed.

Insurance in the amount of $319.16 is claimed on behalf of the Grimstons, this being insurance on the works after the cessation of work by Venture. It was submitted on behalf of Venture that since the works were required to be demolished this claim is unjustified. Clearly, it was not known to the
Grimstons that rectification required of Venture's defective work would be so extensive as to require demolition. This claim, in my opinion, should be allowed.

Included under this heading are approximately $80 of facsimile expenses much of which relate to preparation for these proceedings and to claims made against the Corporation or under the Corporations insurance scheme. In those circumstances I think that this amount should not be included in the
Grimstons' loss or damage.

Item 15, Medical Expenses, $40: This item is covered in the findings on the claim for damages for vexation or aggravated damages although I have not separately quantified it under that assessment.

Item 18, Rent Paid, $11,340: It was submitted on behalf of Venture that the claim for rental "was for the period (Grimston) was negotiating with
Collings". In fact the claim is for the period from December 1991 until
February 1993, that period being from the time of the anticipated completion of the works by Venture and the time of the completion of the rectification works. In my opinion, this claim is well founded and should be included in the assessment of the Grimstons' loss or damage in the amount of $11,340.

Items 16 and 17, Cost to Rectify and Complete as Found by Referee, $128,320 and Item 19, Less, $87,754: The varied report found that the cost of rectification and the completion of the Grimstons' residential building was $128,320. Against this there is to be allowed the represented contract price of $85,600.

The issue surrounding an allowance for the value of the services rendered and the expenses incurred by Collings Construction for the Grimstons raises no fresh questions for consideration than that posed by the conflicting evidence of Sheldon and Shearer. As in those other instances the evidence of Sheldon, in my opinion, is clearly to be preferred. He has expressed the opinion, as in other instances, that the "brochure drawings and documentation were shabby and inadequate". For much the same reasons as I have earlier stated the reasonable allowance for those services and expenses should be $5,000.
The Ferrises 
Item 1, Paid to Collings Construction, $14,129 and Item 2, Paid to Venture
Industries, $60,884: These heads of claim are covered by my earlier findings.

Item 3, Paid Consultant (building), $4,515.50: These consultancy fees were challenged on behalf of Venture on the basis that they related to consultancy services provided for the arbitration in which the Ferrises were involved with
Venture. This is only so of the sum of $2,420 which, consistently with my earlier findings, should be disallowed. The amount to be brought to account in the assessment of the Ferrises' loss or damage is $2,095.50.

Item 5, Paid Consultant (Timber Framing Expert), $359: I do not understand the submission of Venture to challenge the reasonableness of this expense which in my opinion should be included consistently with my earlier findings in respect of like claims.

Item 6, Legal Costs, $225: It was submitted on behalf Venture that this amount should be disregarded as it related to "a dispute with Collings arising out of the design of the roof". I think it is apparent from the findings made in relation to the conduct of Collings and Venture in relation to this matter that I regard this cost as being the result of the contraventions found against Collings Construction and Venture. In my opinion this cost should be included in the Ferrises' loss or damage.

Item 7, Individual Legal Costs (Solicitor and Counsel), $32,096: This claim is covered by earlier rulings and should be limited to $568 being the costs of "Collings issues".

Item 8, Misadventure Club Proportion of Legal Costs $10,380: This claim is covered by previous rulings and is disallowed.

Item 9, Arbitration Fees, $12,000: This claim is covered by previous rulings and is disallowed.

Item 10, Borrowing Expenses (Westpac) (as interest thrown away on borrowings to pay Venture and Collings), $6,876.20: Although initially the subject of challenge on behalf of Venture, this claim was accepted by Venture during the course of submissions.

Item 12, Telephone calls (estimate), $367: This is a claim for the cost of telephone calls over a period of almost three years from February 1991 to
December 1993 on the basis of an average of nineteen calls per month. I have difficulty in accepting that assessment. Further, it covers a period in which the Ferrises were in some form of litigation with Venture and falls into the category of costs rejected by previous rulings. In my opinion, the period during which some allowance would be appropriate is a period of about twelve months from about March 1991 to March 1992. No doubt, during that period, some telephone calls were made. However, my findings in relation to the conduct of the respondents would not substantiate anything like the number of calls claimed. I think the evidence is quite unsatisfactory, having regard to the amount claimed, and I do not propose to undertake any dissection of this head of claim.

Item 13, Travelling expenses (estimate), $1,266: In the case of the travelling expenses the evidence suffers from much the same deficiencies which I have commented upon in relation to similar claims on behalf of other owners. I think the overwhelming majority of these expenses should not be brought to account and accordingly I propose to allow a nominal amount of $200.

Item 14, Cost to demolish/rebuild as found by referee, $131,046 and Item 15,
Less (i) construction price agreed with Collings and (ii) reasonable Collings fee, $2,637.60: The costs as found by the varied report for demolishing and rebuilding was $131,046, after allowing for the value of works which did not require demolition and the benefit of which was retained by the Ferrises. It was submitted on behalf of Venture that in view of the evidence of Ferris that "everything that was useable was reused in the house rebuilding and repair" that the Commission must bring to account something to reflect this benefit "otherwise (the Commission) has not proved (the Ferrises') loss or damage". I do not agree, if this was a matter to be raised then it should have been raised before the referee. As I have earlier stated, no evidence was led before the referee in relation to any such salvage benefit and, accordingly, I regard the respondents as bound by the finding of the varied report. I have treated the represented contract price as being $109,066 by adding to the `contract price' and work additionals, totalling $105,566, the sum of $3,500, as I think some adjustment has to be allowed in the light of my finding that the Ferrises were aware of the presence of rock on the Westleigh property and of the real prospect of additional costs arising therefrom. Accordingly, in my opinion, the sum of $109,066 should be brought to account as the represented price of the works.

The appropriate allowance to be made for the value of services rendered and expenses incurred by Collings Construction on behalf of the Ferrises, raises much the same issues as I have considered in the claims of other owners - revolving around the difference in the opinion evidence of Sheldon and
Shearer. In the case of the design material provided by Collings Construction,
Sheldon regarded it was "shabby and inadequate" and considered that the "terms
Design and Documentation in this context (were) grossly misleading". However, in his assessment Sheldon allowed $3,000 to cover various fees and disbursements. Having regard to the evidence of J Collings (exhibit D1-22) I think this allowance is excessive. The fees and expenditure there evidenced is more in line with the allowance of $1,600 made by Shearer - in J Collings' analysis amounting to approximately $1,637. In my opinion, if the fess were reduced in that order a reasonable allowance for the services rendered and expenses incurred by Collings Construction for the Ferrises would be $5,000.
In my opinion, that is the allowance that should be brought to account.
The Tantis 
Item 1, Paid to Collings Construction, $14,619 and Item 2, Paid to Venture
Industries, $42,487: These claims are covered by previous rulings.

Item 3, Building Consultants, $1,114.80: The only challenge to these fees is the alleged duplication of consultancy retainers, it being submitted that there was no necessity for the retaining of two building consultants. However, the reasonableness of this claim I think is reflected in the evidence of Tanti in cross-examination which was as follows: "Q. Having got Mr Beresford's report in March of 1992, why did you then instruct Mr Ryan to do a similar ....

A. Because Venture seemed to consider Mr John Beresford to run some sort of witch-hunt against him. All I wanted was to get the house finished, so I employed Mr Howard Ryan, who seemed to get on better with Harry Kioussis." (T124.45) 
A further issue is raised on behalf of Venture, namely, that the fees related to the Beresford inspection and report of 9 March 1992 which "was used for submitting a claim to the BSC". This submission was based upon a portion of a
BSC inspector's report (part of exhibit BS) which referred, inter alia, to
Beresford's report. I do not think it follows that Beresford was retained for the purpose as submitted on behalf of Venture. It appeared from the
Corporation's records that the report identified items requiring rectification which had been "rectified to owners building consultant satisfaction". In my opinion, the fees as paid by the Tantis should be included in the assessment of their loss or damage.

Item 4, Engineering Consultants, $880: Although it is not clear from the written submissions on behalf of Venture, it appears that objection is taken to these fees on the basis that they duplicate engineering inspections of the slab element of the subject works and, further, on the basis that Syme was not retained by Tanti, but was retained by a builder on the instructions of the
Corporation. It appears from exhibit E that Syme's fees were incurred for the purpose of obtaining a rectification order from the Corporation directed to
Venture and, partly, to resolve questions raised as to the need for demolition of the subject slab. In my opinion, these costs should be included in the assessment of the Tantis' claim. It has also been submitted that there should be allowed against the costs incurred by the Tantis in retaining expert advice the sum of $1,070.40 representing the amount paid to them by the Corporation.
It is clear from the evidence of Tanti (exhibit E) that such an amount was paid by the Corporation in reimbursement of consultancy fees paid by the
Tantis. It is not clear upon what basis that payment was made by the
Corporation. I think it is open to me to infer that the payment was made under the Corporation insurance scheme and is subject to reimbursements in the circumstances set out earlier in these reasons. In my opinion, no set off should be allowed against the fees incurred by the Tantis to reflect this payment by the Corporation.

Item 6, Legal Expenses. $1,556.90: It was submitted on behalf of Venture that none of these fees were recoverable as having been paid to Russo out of the
Corporation's payment of $375,000 to the Misadventure Club. It was also submitted that, as to $917.25, no details had been provided and, further, that other fees related to such matters as attendances concerning the builder engaged in the demolition and the rectification works for the Tantis along with attendances concerning the ;lodgment and the removal of caveat and an application for legal aid. It was submitted that these costs were not the result of any proscribed conduct of the respondents.

Details of the fee of $917.25 are to be found in exhibit CO and are identified as: "Building & Construction issues $550 
Mortgagee Negotiations re: building $375" 
Presumably Russo has rounded off the amount of $917.25. Of the amount claimed it is possible to identify $770 as being the fees for building and construction issues and that sum should be allowed. The balance of the claim is covered by previous rulings and is disallowed.

Item 7, Misadventure Club, $10,380: This claim is covered by previous rulings and should be disallowed.
 
Item 8, Borrowing Expenses, $2801.28: The evidence in support of this head of claim (exhibit C, par 7, annexure MCT8 and T 123 - 129) established that for the purpose of putting in place sufficient loan funds to finance the reconstruction works necessary to rectify Venture's defective works the Tantis were required to discharge their existing mortgage at a cost of $2,751.28 and to negotiate a fresh loan arrangement. It has been submitted on behalf of
Venture that there "could have been no obligation on (Tanti's) part to repay the loan, he merely could have kept the same loan and used the BSC money towards building another house". Apart from the evidence above referred to, there was no cross-examination of Tanti to this effect and, in my opinion, his evidence in chief established the reasonableness of this claim. The full amount of the claim should be allowed.

Item 9, Rent Paid, $6,375: The submissions of Venture appear to misunderstand the nature of this claim for rent. It is for a period from April 1992 (that being the date when the Venture contract works should have been completed under the contract (exhibit A annexure MCT21)) and the time of commencement of the rectification works in November 1992: and from November 1992 until April a period which represents a period of reconstruction of the subject works. The submissions of Venture appear to relate the period of twelve months to an unreasonable period of reconstruction. It clearly is not so claimed and the amount claimed should be allowed as part of the Tantis' loss or damage.

Item 10, Removal Costs, $131.88: It was submitted by Venture that there was no explanation for the necessity to incur this cost. The evidence of Tanti I think clearly established that this cost was incurred as a result of having to transfer "household items" for use in the dwelling under construction to a temporary accommodation in St Marys. It think it is reasonable to infer that this was a cost that would have been unnecessary had Venture performed satisfactorily. The sum claimed should be allowed.

Item 11, Postal Expenses, $36: A portion of these expenses would be allowable as going to the termination of contractual dealings between the Tantis and
Venture. The balance should not be allowed for the reasons previously stated in relation to expenses incurred with the claims on the Corporation and in other legal proceedings in which the various owners were involved. The amount in issue does not warrant a dissection of costs 
Item 12, Telephone calls, $523: In my opinion, the evidence in relation to this head of claim is so unsatisfactory as not to warrant any allowance to be made in the estimate of the Tantis' loss or damage. The claim covers a period from February 1991 to December 1993 without any attempt to break up the costs in respect of that period. It is unsupported by any records other than for the sum of $53. The evidence of Tanti amounts to a simple "estimate that (he had) incurred a total of $523 in telephone charges". It is apparent from the description of the activities of the Tantis that significant costs would have been incurred in relation to other proceedings and in particular the activities from the Misadventure Club. The findings earlier stated in relation to the Tantis' dealings with the respondents would justify allowing the cost of a comparatively small number of telephone calls. However, I do not propose to attempt an exercise in extracting some figure representing an expense incurred by the Tantis under this heading.

Item 13, Travelling Expenses, $3,702: The travelling expenses of the Tantis are calculated in similar fashion to those made on behalf of the other owners.
However, there is more detail in the particular purpose of the subject travelling. Consistently with my approach in relation to the claims by other owners, I think the early visits prior to tender should be disregarded and a point identified after which the travelling is substantially related to the activities of the Misadventure Club, preparations for these proceedings, claims for payments under the Corporation insurance scheme or outside that scheme by the Corporation and other miscellaneous matters such as visits to the Tantis' accountant. I think the appropriate cut off time should be about
July - August 1992 when Venture completed its attempts at rectification.
Approached in this way I think a sum of $1,500 should be allowed.

Item 14, Parking and Toll Fees: In support of this claim there were no records other than a receipt for 18 January 1993 in the sum of $11. In my opinion, the evidence on this aspect is unsatisfactory and I do not think it appropriate to allow any sum under this heading.
 (There appears to have been omitted a claim in the summary for a proportion of the Misadventure Club costs, although evidence of these costs was adduced in the evidence in chief of Tanti (exhibit C, par 14(3)). I note that the written submissions on behalf of Venture address this claim. In case the omission is the result of oversight, expenses should be noted as disallowed consistently with the rulings I have given on similar claims on behalf of other owners.) 
Item 15, Cost to Demolish and Rebuild as found by Referee, $152,843: As found by the varied report, the amount of $152,843 should be allowed. Venture has submitted that there should be an allowance for "the value of scrap for the sale of windows" in the sum of $700. In fact the amount involved is $500 (see exhibit D). It is conceded on behalf of the Tantis that $500 should be deducted from the cost of demolition and rebuilding stated above.

Item 16, Less (i) Construction Price Agreed with Collings and (ii) Reasonable
Collings Fee, $108,341: Further allowance has to be made for the contract price represented by Collings Construction, namely $106,064.

An allowance for the reasonable value of the services rendered and fees incurred by Collings Construction for the Tantis falls to be resolved substantially within the ambit of the competing evidence of Shearer and of
Sheldon and, as with the other owners' claims, I prefer the evidence of
Sheldon for much the same reasons as earlier stated.

Shearer's opinion was that the value of the services were "in the range of
Fifteen to Sixteen Thousand Dollars" which he supported, inter alia, by reference to the prevailing RAIA guide plus an allowance of $1,600 for fees and $3,000 for the special costs of a marketer of exhibition homes. Sheldon was derogatory of the standard of services provided by Collings Construction as being "shabby and inadequate". There is no doubt in my opinion that the services so provided by Collings Construction were of a basic kind and defective in the manner detailed in these reasons. The evidence of J Collings established that the allowance by Shearer of $1,600 was approximately correct.
Sheldon in his revised summary advances a total reasonable fee of $6,000.
However that includes a sum of $3,000 for fees and disbursements and in my view that should be reduced to bring it into line with the estimates made in relation to the other owners and in accordance with the actual disbursements evidenced by J Collings. In my opinion, a sum of $4,500 represents a reasonable allowance for the services rendered and the expenses incurred by
Collings Construction on behalf of the Tantis.

In assessing the owners' loss or damage I have disallowed any amount to be brought to account in respect of the payments received by the owners from the
Corporation or Wollondilly Council. If I am wrong in that approach it would mean that costs which I have disallowed as being incurred in obtaining payment of those moneys should be brought to account in order to calculate the nett benefit to the owners under those payments..

L. Damages for Vexation and Aggravated Damages 
The Commission has claimed on behalf of all owners damages for vexation or aggravated damages. The claim for exemplary damages was not pressed, it being accepted that such damages were not recoverable pursuant to <case> of the Act.
Except in the case of the Quaglias, I have no doubt that damages for vexation or aggravated damages should be awarded against Venture. I regard the conduct of Venture as predatory in its relationship with the various owners and contemptuous of the interests of the owners from the outset. I think this conduct was endemic to the Venture organisation probably typified by the fraudulent display of a University degree certificate in the Venture office.
Further, I regard the need to demolish most of the works constructed by
Venture as a reflection of the nature of the Venture organisation as one technically incompetent and indifferent to the standards of construction required of a building corporation.

It has been submitted on behalf of Venture that I should not have regard to the manner in which the respective contracts were performed and, in particular, to acts of vandalism, of intimidation and of complete disregard for the property and dignity of certain of the owners. It was submitted on behalf of Venture that, if such conduct had been proved, then the owners should be left to independent remedies that may be available to them in respect of such infringements of their rights. The basis for that submission as I understood it was that such conduct was separate from, independent of and post dated Venture's contraventions. I do not agree. In my opinion, that was the implementation of conduct of Venture. I think it was part and parcel of the deception practised on the owners from the outset as to the nature of the organisation with which they were dealing. Included in that conduct, quite apart from the totally incompetent performance of the works, was the policy of harassment of owners who sought to resist the conduct of Venture by the institution of arbitrations and by the lodgement of caveats on the titles of the owners' properties. Given the importance of the subject matter of the contract to each of the owners, the conduct of Venture was calculated to cause considerable distress to the owners. In my opinion, Venture was singularly successful.

In awarding damages I do not see the need to distinguish whether the damages are awarded for vexation or by way of aggravated damages. In all instances, except in the case if the Quaglias, there was clearly considerable distress and anxiety created by the pattern of conduct of Venture in the way in which it virtually forced contractual commitments upon the owners, deceived them as to the contractual consequences of the documents which they were required to sign and as to the nature of the organisation with which the owners were dealing. This deception was reflected in the purported performance of the contracts, the series of claims for variations, which to say the least, bore the marks of being dubious and which commenced immediately after entry into the contracts. There then followed lodgements of caveats on title, the pressure for payment, threats of litigation, actual institution of arbitrations, performance of ineffective rectification works and, in some instances, seeking payment for that rectification. In all cases the works were performed to a deplorable standard of construction. When it is understood that the owners were persons of limited resources and when it is understood that they were put under significant financial pressure and were confronted with the destruction of all of their anticipations in achieving the construction of a residence for their establishment of a family home, it is not at all surprising that the owners suffered significantly. The damages for the most part I would treat as damages for vexation except for the acts of harassment, intimidation and damage to property, which, fit more into the category of damages for aggravation.

Generally, however, the damages, howsoever occasioned had the one effect of acute distress and anguish over a considerable period of time and I see no risk of duplication of damages by any failure to label damage as being for vexation or by way of aggravated damages.

There is ample authority, both in the case of the award of damages under the
Act and in analogous proceedings for negligence, for the proposition that damages for vexation, severe inconvenience and significant mental distress, such as are claimed for in these proceedings on behalf of the owners, are appropriate damages to award in circumstances such as were evidenced in these proceedings. In Holloway -v- Witham & Anor (1990) 21 NSWLR 70 at 86 Lee
J collected the principal cases on this subject matter in proceedings under comparable provisions of the [Fair Trading Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fta1987117/). In awarding such damages, his Honour noted that such claims ".... cannot, attract the very large sums which are appropriate in cases of permanent physical or nervous shock injuries arising from personal injury cases. The anguish, frustration and heartbreak experienced in being denied the opportunity to move into one's chosen home, or to move into a habitable home, is to be seen as a transient circumstance and not one of lasting consequences, although in one sense it may significantly change the direction of one's endeavours or intentions. Life can be full of setbacks of one kind or another and the law can only provide a solatium." (At 87) 
In that case the Court was concerned with major contractual breaches or failure of contractual consideration in dealings involving the relocation of moveable residential buildings. One of the authorities there referred to was that of Perry -v- Sidney Phillips & Son [[1982] 3 All ER 705:] a case dealing with damages for vexation arising out of the negligent advice of a surveyor as to the habitable condition of a residential building intended for occupation as a home by the surveyor's client. Another was that of the Court of Appeal in Brickhill & Anor -v- Cooke & Anor [(1984) 3 NSWLR ]
which approved the decision of Perry (at p 400).

Perry was further considered in Campbelltown City Council & Ors -v-
Mackay & Anor [(1988) 15 NSWLR 501] where, at and 505 respectively, Kirby P and Samuels JA, in referring to Perry could find no justification for the opinion of Lord Denning in Perry that damages should be "Not excessive, but modest compensation". In the same judgment McHugh J cited Perry and Brickhill with approval. Perry,
Brickhill and Campbelltown City Council were cited by Rolfe J in Johnston & Anor -v- Irwin Johnston and Partners NSW Pty Ltd & Anor (Supreme
Court of New South Wales, 4 December 1995, unreported), a case in which his
Honour allowed damages for vexation suffered as a result of the devastation experienced by the owners of property when it collapsed as a result of the defendant's negligence. In Zoneff & Anor -v- Elcom Credit Union Ltd [(1990) ATPR 41-009] at 51,161 Hill J allowed damages for distress suffered as a result of conduct proscribed by <case> of the Act. His Honour observed that "It was not in dispute that in a proper case damages of this nature could have been awarded in deceit and that the measure of damage under sec. 52 and 82, being akin to that in tort, permitted the recovery of such damages" 
His Honour referred to McGregor on Damages 15th ed. at paragraph 1737. The case went on appeal and it is apparent that on appeal the full Court had no difficulty with such an award of damages (Zoneff [(1990) ATPR 41-058] at -747).

Counsel on behalf of Venture referred the Court to a line of authorities, the principal one being that of the High Court in Baltic Shipping Co -v- Dillon <case>; [(1993) 176 CLR 344.] However, that authority and the cases examined by it are concerned with the contractual measure of damages and I have found little or no assistance by reference to those decisions other than to observe that in the judgment of Mason CJ at 359 there appears the following passage: "THE CLAIM FOR DAMAGES FOR DISAPPOINTMENT AND DISTRESS 
Pain and suffering is a well-known common law head of damage recoverable in actions for damages for personal injury, whether awarded for tortious conduct or conduct which constitutes a breach of statutory duty. And, in some circumstances at least, a plaintiff can recover damages for injury to his or her feelings caused by tortious conduct; assault, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution and defamation are causes of action in which a plaintiff may recover damages on that score. This is not surprising. As Lord Cranworth
V.C. observed in Kemp v. Sober (81), "the feeling of anxiety is damage". No doubt his Lordship, by that statement, intended to convey that damages could be recovered by a plaintiff for anxiety, disappointment or distress when those feelings were the consequence of conduct for which damages are recoverable and the damages recoverable for that actionable wrong include compensation for injured feelings of that kind." (pp 359-360) 
And in speaking of the general rule against recovery of such damages in breach of contract, the Chief Justice further observed: "... The general rule that damages for anxiety, disappointment and distress are not recoverable in actions for breach of contract is, in any event, subject to exceptions to which I shall refer shortly. The scope of the exceptions has been expanded by judicial decision in recent years, so much so that the authority of the general rule is now somewhat uncertain." (p 361) 
Mason CJ then proceeded to examine the considerations which may have given rise to the contractual general rule and to the exceptions therefrom, concluding with the statement: " But one might ask why the injured party should be deemed to take the risk of damage of a particular kind when the fundamental principle on which damages are awarded at common law is that the injured party is to be restored to the position (not merely the financial position) in which the party would have been had the actionable wrong not taken place. Add to that the fact that anxiety and injured feelings are recognized as heads of compensable damage, at least outside the realm of the law of contract. Add as well the circumstance that the general rule has been undermined by the exceptions which have been engrafted upon it. We are then left with a rule which rests on flimsy policy foundations and conceptually is at odds with the fundamental principle governing the recovery of damages, the more so now that the approaches in tort and contract are converging." (p 362)
The Corbetts 
In the case of the Corbetts I have covered in my previous findings much of the way in which they were shamefully treated by Venture. From the outset claims for variations of dubious validity were submitted to them, including claims for the costs of rectification of Venture's faulty brickwork. The work on their residential building commenced in November 1990 and within a matter of a few weeks they were threatened with a stoppage of the works unless payments were made. This developed into threats of arbitration and further threats of stoppages which extended into the middle of 1991. It was not until December that the Corbetts were able to get into their residence when they noticed the roof and walls cracking, eaves sagging, brickwork cracked, ceilings sagged and roof tiles cracked together with a garage that couldn't accommodate a normal family sized motor car - unless it was parked diagonally! As earlier stated the building had to be reconstructed at huge expense after dilatory and ineffective efforts at rectification by Venture. In my earlier findings I referred to the evidence of Corbett of the deplorable conduct of P Kioussis in
July 1992 in purporting to carry out rectification work. In order to rectify the works, the Corbetts, as owner builders, demolished the works as performed by Venture down to the slab and over a period of years undertook reconstruction of their home. I find it in no way surprising that by April Corbett was undergoing medical treatment as a result of a condition diagnosed as "duodenitis or several duodenal ulcers ... anxiety and depression and insomnia". Despite treatment by Dr William Henry Moss (Moss), it was noted that the disabilities were continuing some seven months later. The history obtained by Moss was of "undergoing stress for about two years with problems with housing". It was the opinion of Moss that the condition diagnosed was "stress related and he noted that he had been unable to "identify any other causes on (his) history or examination ... other than those related to ...
problems with housing". Moss' prognosis was that the condition was likely to continue until the stress factor was resolved, upon which event he expected the condition to "gradually settle with possible future flare ups ...". At the time of Moss's report of 4 February 1994, Corbett was undergoing daily medication and it was anticipated that future medication would be involved. He thought the condition was capable of interfering with the capacity of Corbett to work "due to poor concentration ... epigastric pains ... and due to tiredness from insomnia and from anxiety and depression". I have no doubt that the stress created by Venture was the probable cause of this condition and in my opinion Corbett is entitled to damages of $25,000 for this condition and the stress undergone over an extended period during and following the purported performance of the works by Venture. There has been no attempt to quantify any special damages.

A Corbett gave evidence of having suffered anxiety and migraine headaches during the period of her dealings with Venture which resulted in her seeking medical treatment to relax the tension created by Venture. In my opinion, an award of damages of $15,000 is reasonable for this condition of anxiety and stress which I attribute to the conduct of Venture over a period of some twenty months which included a period of her pregnancy.
The Quaglias 
I have no doubt that the Quaglias' dealings with Venture were extremely distasteful to them. However, for the reasons previously stated, I do not regard the evidence as warranting an assessment of damages against Venture.
The Staps 
The aggressive conduct of Kioussis towards the Staps began with their first meeting in July of 1991 when Kioussis threatened to stop works alleged to be under way unless the Staps signed Venture's contract documents. In my earlier findings I described the conduct of Venture to the Staps in the following twelve months and there is no occasion to repeat those findings in detail.
They were of a kind which would inevitably have occasioned great distress to the Staps. There was the usual submission of dubious claims for variations.
With the expiration of the lease of the premises they were occupying as a home, the Staps moved into caravan accommodation on their Dural property.
During 1992 there were distressing confrontations with Kioussis over claims which either in whole or in part were unfounded. Throughout these confrontations Kioussis resorted to threats of litigation and arbitration and refused to provide substantiating invoices for variational claims. He demanded that meetings take place "at the registered office of the company" - an absurd demand. Arbitration proceedings were commenced which, in light of the deplorable standard of the works, can only be regarded as an act of harassment. Venture reserved most offensive conduct for its dealings with the
Staps. The conduct involved vituperative statements directed to N Stap, the
Staps' children and to Stap, in the last mentioned case involving threats of violence. Their property was damaged during purported rectification works. It was necessary to obtain police assistance to remove the Venture representatives from the Dural property. As I have found property was vandalised by P Kioussis or at least in the presence of that respondent, this conduct occupied a period of over eighteen months. after which the Staps were then faced with the task of demolishing and reconstructing their intended residence.

The conduct of the Venture group towards the Stap has been set out in some detail in the evidence in chief of N Stap (exhibit T), particularly for the period after mid 1992. I accept that evidence entirely. It is difficult to fully appreciate just how distressing that conduct must have been to the
Staps. Although I have disallowed heads of claim for expenses related to the sale of the Dural property, I think it is a measure of the extreme stress undergone by the Staps as a result of this conduct of the Venture group that they initially felt a need to vacate the Dural property during its reconstruction. It was distressing to the Staps that their children were forced to witness much of this deplorable conduct of Venture. In my opinion an award of damages of $15,000 to each of the Staps of damages for the vexation and stress which the Staps were forced to endure should be awarded.
The Smiths 
Their experience in dealings with the Venture group has been covered by my earlier findings. In general terms, their experience bore a similarity with that encountered by other owners in relation to the receipt of demands for payment of unjustified variations. There were subjected to a completely incompetent performance of the works by Venture and ineffectual attempts at rectification, the initiation of arbitration proceedings and the lodgment of a caveat on the title to the Galston property. These lastmentioned were acts of harassment. The period over which this conduct occurred lasted for approximately twelve months with some particularly unsavoury conduct occurring towards the end of that period after the commencement of reconstruction works by the Smiths. L Smith gave evidence that on 3 September 1992 while this reconstruction work was in progress Magaitas from Venture came onto the
Galston property and despite the requests of L Smith refused to leave and only did so after he had assaulted L Smith, trespassed into her home and after being informed that the police had been notified of his conduct. Following this confrontation L Smith sought medical attention for her distress and depression. She was referred by her treating doctor to a psychologist for counselling. Generally, of her reaction to the conduct of Venture, she gave evidence that it had greatly interfered with her enjoyment of life and was extremely stressful to both Smith and herself and their children.

For some months during this period Smith was absent overseas and to that extent escaped some of the trauma that L Smith was subjected to. In my opinion the sum of $15,000 should be awarded to compensate L Smith for the trauma that she was forced to endure and $8,000 should be awarded to Smith.
The Grimstons 
The Grimstons' experience with the Venture group lasted for approximately twelve months in the manner outlined in my earlier findings. They were subjected to similar treatment to that experienced by other owners by way of dubious claims for variations, the performance of defective works, harassment in the form of the institution of an arbitration and the lodgement of a caveat on the Yellow Rock property. It was the evidence of S Grimston which I accepted that she had suffered from her treatment at the hands of Venture. In her evidence in chief she stated: "I have had anti-depressants and sedatives prescribed for me since the building problems emerged. My symptoms have included loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and long periods of depressed mood, and crying. My life and our family life have suffered significant disruption, and our family activities have been restricted because of the time, energy and money eaten up by the process of fighting Harry Kioussis and Wayne Collings." (Exhibit AF, par 75) 
It is clear that the condition of S Grimston was not assisted by other domestic concerns unrelated to the respondents conduct. In my opinion the sum of $15,000 for S Grimston and $8,000 for Grimston represents a reasonable assessment of the compensation to which they are entitled for the distress suffered by each of them as a result of the conduct by Venture. The damages include the special damages incurred by S Grimston.
The Ferrises 
The experience of the Ferrises was similar to that of Grimstons. I think it is set out in sufficient detail in my earlier findings on the conduct of Venture.
In my opinion the sum of $8,000 for D Ferris and $8,000 for Ferris should be included in their loss or damage to compensate them for the effect of the conduct of Venture on their physical condition.
The Tantis 
My earlier findings as to the conduct of the Venture group do not require restatement. In general terms, the Tantis were subjected to the usual demands for payment of doubtful variations. The work performed by Venture was incompetent, they were subjected to harassment in the form of the institution of an arbitration and the lodgment of a caveat on the title to their Glenmore
Park property. This conduct lasting over a period of more than twelve months.
I think the effect on the Tantis of the conduct of the Venture group is captured in his evidence in cross-examination concerning the Misadventure Club which I have quoted earlier in these reasons. In that evidence Tanti described the function of the group as one "formed to give moral and financial assistance to one another". In describing the beneficial nature of participation in the group his evidence is repeated below: "... by that I mean, it has been effective in that at least my marriage is still alive. Because I've spoken to many people who have had similar type instances that are now divorced. As far as moral - as a moral help it has been a moral help. Everyone else in the group will certainly say that too, because no matter who you talk to, to them it is your problem. When I talk to Mr
Ferris or Mr Grimston, at least when I am talking to them they understand, they know. They really understand. But if I talk to the average person at work or something, they understand, they feel sorry you, but they don't really understand that it is a day to day thing, that is not something that happens and goes away." 
In my opinion the sum of $8,000 should be awarded to each of the Tantis to compensate them for the obvious distress that each of them has suffered at the hands of the Venture group.

M. Involvement in the Contraventions - General Principles 
In considering the involvement of the personal respondents, it has been common ground that I should approach that issue in accordance with the interpretation of <case> of the Act as discussed by the High Court in Yorke & Anor -v-
Lucas <case>; [(1985) 158 CLR 661], a case which has been applied and followed in numerous cases. S 75B(1) of the Act provides: "A reference ... to a person involved in a contravention ... shall be read as a reference to a person who - has aided, abetted, counselled or procured the contravention; has induced, whether by threats or promises or otherwise, the contravention; has been in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contravention; or has conspired with other to effect the contravention." 
Yorke -v- Lucas required an intentional aiding and abetting by persons who are accessories within the meaning of par (a). Of par (c), in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Wilson Deane and Dawson JJ, it was said that: "There can be no question that a person cannot be knowingly concerned in a contravention unless he has knowledge of the essential facts constituting the contravention...(that)...the natural construction of par. (c) is to regard the word "knowingly" as qualifying only the words "concerned in" which immediately follow it. The punctuation strongly suggests such a construction. Secondly, the word "knowingly" would be an unnecessary qualification of the words "party to". In the context of the paragraph, a person could only properly be said to be "party to" a "contravention" if his participation was in the context of knowledge of the essential facts constituting the particular contravention in question.... (there was) nothing in the paragraph itself which would point to any conclusion other than that the words "party to" are used to refer to a participant in the nature of an accessory.... In our view, the proper construction of par. (c) requires a party to a contravention to be an intentional participant, the necessary intent being based upon knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention." (at 670)
Kioussis 
So approaching the evidence concerning the involvement of the personal respondents, it is accepted that Kioussis was involved in a relevant contravention of the Act within the meaning of <case>. However, that was a limited concession which centred upon his fraudulent representations as to the holding of a university degree in building. However, I think the conduct which
I have found against Venture is much wider than that and I think it is beyond argument that Kioussis was involved in those contraventions as found against
Venture. The evidence established that his knowledge extended to a keen awareness of the manner in which Collings Construction dealt with the owners prior to their being handed over to Venture and, in particular, that the owners were, committed to contractual arrangements which contained the seeds for their exploitation by Venture. I have found that the organisation created by Kioussis in Venture was that of a predator rather than that of a provider of services. For that Kioussis must bear full responsibility as a person involved in the subject contraventions by Venture. No distinction should be made as to quantum in relation to the liability of Venture and of Kioussis in respect of the claims of the owners.
P Kioussis 
On behalf of P Kioussis it has been submitted that she was not involved in any way in the contraventions and, in particular, that she had no knowledge of the fraudulent nature of the representations of Kioussis as to his qualifications.
I have found it unnecessary to resolve the question whether she had knowledge of the fraudulent nature of Kioussis' representations that he held a university degree in building. It was submitted on her behalf that I should have regard to the judgment of Giles CJ Comm D in Building Services
Corporation -v- Commercial Tribunal of New South Wales & Anor (Supreme
Court of New South Wales, 4 April 1995, unreported). As a matter of evidence that decision is irrelevant in my consideration of the alleged involvement of
P Kioussis. It was further submitted that her conduct related to the administration of contracts and occurred "at a time when the contracts were already on foot, and in most cases, where the contracts had been running for some time". Hence, it was submitted, P Kioussis' conduct was independent of the contraventions alleged against Venture. Of the conversation between
Magaitas and P Kioussis, in which she acknowledged the Venture policy of making profit from variation claims, it was submitted that this conversation took place at a time which "had no relevance to any of the contracts" and, in any event, that it was a statement which was unexceptional in that it did not carry an imputation that the variations would be claimed "in a wrongful or unlawful manner". It was also suggested that a practice of using variations to derive profit was not unheard of in the building industry. It was further submitted that even if one accepted some awareness on the part of P Kioussis that such conduct of Venture was improper there still needed to be established a connection between the alleged contravention and that knowledge of P
Kioussis. Finally, it was submitted that the consents of the various owners did not extend to found an action by the Commission to claim any loss or damage on behalf of the owners against P Kioussis. This last mentioned matter has been examined earlier in these reasons and resolved against the respondent. Generally, it was submitted on her behalf that there was no evidence that she was involved in any under quoting of the contract price, that she had any knowledge of the incompetence of Venture or of the breach of the deposit provisions of the BSC Act.

While the burden of proof may be squarely on the Commission, what has not been stated by counsel for P Kioussis is that, notwithstanding a considerable body of evidence relating to her involvement in the dealings by Venture with the various owners, she has not been called to give evidence. That is a factor which, in my opinion, counts heavily against her when one begins to analyse the evidence that has been adduced concerning her conduct.

I think there can be little doubt that P Kioussis was involved in the Venture contravention concerning some of the owners, even if one concluded in her favour that she had no knowledge of the falsity of the representations concerning Kioussis' university degree. I think one starts with the fact that she was a director of Venture, present on occasions when the owners entered into contractual arrangements with Venture, that she acted as supervisor in more than one of the subject building works, and that she was involved in rectification works in some instances. I think one can infer from this close connection with various projects that she must have had some knowledge of the incompetence of Venture, given the extraordinarily low building standards exhibited by Venture in all of its attempts to construct the owners' residential buildings. It seems to me beyond argument that at some early stage she must have been aware of the incompetence of Venture. In the absence of evidence from P Kioussis, I think I am entitled to infer from her extensive participation in the owners' projects that P Kioussis was aware, at all relevant times, of the incompetence of Venture.

Further, I think her involvement in the administration of variations should be viewed in the context of the role that claims for variations played in
Venture's contraventions. The case against Venture has not been simply a case of sharp practice in relation to the charging for variations. The case which has been established shows that Venture concealed from the owners their financial exposure to Venture under the respective building contracts at the time of contract and, in this deception, recourse to variations during performance of the works played a central role. I think the evidence of
Magaitas of his conversation with P Kioussis concerning her knowledge of
Venture's use of variation claims should be seen in that context, particularly so in the absence of any evidence from her. I also consider that her particular dealings with the owners revealed her awareness of Venture's deceptive practices with variations at the time of preparation of contract documents for execution by the owners. It is very hard to accept that in submitting these claims that she was oblivious to their inflated if not fraudulent nature. A final general observation relates to her conduct on site.
It was P Kioussis who was involved in some of the more unsavoury aspects of the performance of the works by Venture, including acts of vandalism and acts which offered no respect for the person or property of the owners. I do not think one can dismiss that conduct as irrelevant in the sense that it occurred after the contraventions which induced the owners to enter into contract with
Venture. I think the conduct of P Kioussis should be seen as that of a director of Venture and as being one of its willing and knowing instruments.

When one addresses the evidence of her conduct in relation to particular owners, in my opinion, it becomes clear that, except in the cases of the
Quaglias and the Grimstons that conduct justifies a finding of involvement in
Venture's contraventions.

I regard the evidence in the Corbetts' case as weighing very heavily against P
Kioussis in terms of her involvement in Venture's contraventions. P Kioussis was the supervisor of the works. My findings of her administration of the contract reveal an awareness by her of the manner in which Venture used variation claims, an awareness that those claims were unjustifiably excessive and that they were made possible by Venture's deception of the Corbetts at the time of contract. They also reveal a willingness to resort to threats of stoppages and of arbitration to force payment of unjustified demands by
Venture. I consider her to be the knowing vehicle for implementing Venture's contraventions. Her attitude to the performance of rectification works reinforces those views. If she was not aware at the time of commencement of the Corbetts work she must have known during performance that Venture was completely without expertise as a builder. I think the only thing that may be said in her favour is that one may surmise that she acted under the influence of her father. However, as I have found, in that she showed herself to be a willing and active participant, well aware that she was involved in the implementation of deceptive conduct by Venture. Her unexplained absence from the witness box in the face of this body of evidence reinforces those findings.

There is little or no evidence of involvement by P Kioussis in the conduct of
Venture towards the Quaglias and I make no finding against P Kioussis of involvement in any contraventions concerning the Quaglias.

The evidence of Venture's contraventions concerning the Staps does not disclose any direct participation by P Kioussis at the time of the entry into the contract between Venture and the Staps, or in the initial construction activities. She became a supervisor of the works in March of 1992 and thereafter carried out contract administration. She was involved in the lodgement of a caveat on the title to the Dural property, conduct which I regard as part of a pattern of harassment by Venture. Her conduct during the performance of purported rectification work I have found to be reprehensible.
It was the Staps' property in which P Kioussis took part in vandalism. This was conduct which I have found exemplified the nature and propensity of the
Venture organisation. I am satisfied that her conduct constituted knowing participation in Venture's contraventions and a willingness to implement
Venture's deceptions.

When the Smiths attended Venture's office to settle contractual arrangements with Venture, P Kioussis was present for part of the time and was introduced as the person who would be supervising construction. She was involved in the administration of variations, in the giving of a notice of dispute, and in a stop work notice given by Venture to the Smiths. I think the evidence of this conduct carries the imputations that P Kioussis must have been aware of
Venture's building incompetence, of its deception in the formulation of contractual provisions and the use of variation claims and that she was a knowing implement in Venture's contraventions.

There is virtually no evidence of any involvement of P Kioussis in the contraventions of Venture towards the Grimstons and, although one may draw some inference from the totality of the evidence against P Kioussis of her general participation in the affairs of Venture, I prefer to make no finding against P Kioussis in relation to the conduct of Venture concerning the
Grimstons.

P Kioussis was present at various times during the discussions between
Kioussis and the Ferrises involving the formation of the contract between
Venture and the Ferrises. She was identified as the person who would be the supervisor of the works. It is apparent that P Kioussis was thereafter involved in the supervision and administration of the contract. That role included the administration of what I regard as dubious claims for variations and harassment in the form of a threatened stoppage unless payments as demanded by Venture were made. I think it is reasonable to infer that she was involved in Venture's contraventions within the meaning of <case>(1A).

In the case of the Tantis, it appears that Maher was the "Contract Controller" until the end of the first quarter of 1992. The evidence disclosed that, thereafter, P Kioussis supervised and administered the Tantis' contract beginning with a demand for payment of variations in the capacity of contract controller by letter dated 16 April 1992. She became involved in negotiations with the Tantis and the Corporation over defective work and disputed variations. She was engaged in the supervision of purported rectification work. Although the evidence relating to her involvement in the conduct of
Venture towards the Tantis is limited, I do not think it can be separated from contemporaneous conduct of involvement in contraventions of Venture towards other owners. Viewed in that way I think the evidence disclosed that P
Kioussis was knowingly concerned in and party to Venture's contraventions in relation to the Tantis. Accordingly I find that P Kioussis was involved in
Venture's contraventions concerning the owners other than the Quaglias and the
Grimstons. In reaching those conclusions I make no finding of knowledge of the falsity of Kioussis' representations concerning the holding of a university degree in building.

In my opinion P Kioussis should be held liable for those damages for which
Venture is liable in respect of the claim of the Corbetts, the Staps, the
Smiths, the Ferrises and the Tantis.
Collings 
In the case of Collings, the findings which I have made and which I find unnecessary to repeat, I think, make it clear that he was knowingly concerned in and a party to the contraventions of Collings Construction and of Venture.
I except from that the conduct of Venture concerning the use of the forged university degree and the conduct of harassment and intimidation practised on site by Venture giving rise to the claim for aggravated damages or for vexation. I do not think it matters whether or not Collings knew at the outset, that is at the time of his dealing with the Corbetts, of the incompetence and of the extent of the predatory nature of the Venture organisation. In my opinion, it is sufficient to say that he could not have had a reasonable basis for holding out Venture as a craftsman or as a builder with a reputation for excellence. I have little doubt that Collings was well aware of the nature of the contractual structure he had put in place for organisations such as Venture to exploit. In my opinion Collings should be found to have been a knowing party to the contraventions Collings Construction and of Venture.
J Collings 
I am firmly of the view that no case has been established of involvement in the contraventions of Collings Construction or of Venture on the part of J
Collings. She is a person well advanced in years with a history of what appears to have been a successful business association with her husband, the founder of the business, in part, now carried on by Collings Construction.
Although I have little doubt that she referred to Collings or to Collings
Construction as a builder to one or other of the owners, I think it was more in the context of an expression of misplaced pride in Collings and in the manner of a loose description of the ultimate service which I think she believed would have been provided through Collings Construction to the various owners. I think she was quite unaware of the nature and incompetence of
Venture and equally unaware of the deficiencies of Collings Construction in its dealings with the owners. While the evidence disclosed that she was aware of advertising material which described Collings Construction as a "personal builder" I think that evidence falls far short of a case of involvement in the subject contraventions as claimed by the Commission.

N. Orders 
In accordance with these reasons for judgment I find the first and third defendants have engaged in conduct in contravention of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/s52.html) of the [Trade Practices Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/numact/tpa1974149/) and that the second, fourth and sixth defendants have been involved in the contraventions in the manner set out in these reasons. I order that the first, second, third, fourth and sixth defendants pay the loss or damage found to have been suffered by the persons on behalf of whom this application has been made in the amounts calculated in accordance with these reasons. I order that the subject contracts between the third defendant and those persons on behalf of whom the application is brought are unenforceable save for the arbitration provisions of those contracts. The application against the fifth defendant is dismissed.
I decline to make orders in terms of pars 9A(iii), 9B and 9C of the application in view of the undertaking to the Court by counsel on behalf of the third defendant to withdraw and to no further pursue its claim against the persons on behalf of whom this application is made and against whom arbitration proceedings have been commenced by the third defendant. I direct the parties to bring in short minutes of order incorporating such an undertaking and the effect of the findings made in these reasons together with such further orders as the parties contend should be made in relation to injunctive relief interest costs supported by submissions.

In relation to injunctive relief, the submissions should pay particular regard to the function and powers of the Building Services Corporation in exercising supervisory control of building works under the Building Services [Corporation Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1989154/). The defendants are further directed to bring in amended defences in conformity with the leave granted in the course of these reasons.

TRADE PRACTICES COMMISSION versus COLLINGS CONSTRUCTION CO P/L & 5 ORS /94 
Wednesday, 5 February 1997 
SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COMMERCIAL DIVISION 
HUNTER J 
SUPPLEMENTARY REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: In delivering my reasons on 10 December 1996 I gave the parties the opportunity of presenting further submissions in relation to what, if any, orders should be made by way of (1) injunctive relief, (2) interest and (3) costs - the first and third of those matters at the request of the parties. On 23 December 1996 the parties presented written and oral submissions, which in the case of the Commission were supported by short minutes of order (the short minutes) which I have dated 23 December 1996, initialled and placed with the papers. In these supplementary reasons I have adopted the same terminology as was used in my 10 December 1996 reasons.

Injunctive Relief 
It is convenient to address the question of injunctive relief first in relation to the Venture group. The short minutes proposed injunctive relief of a detailed kind presumably in an endeavour to conform with the principles expressed in ICI Australia Operations Pty Limited -v- Trade Practices Commission <case>; [(1992) 38 FCR 248] at 185), it is clear that any injunctive relief "should be granted in clear and unambiguous terms which leave no room for the persons to whom they are directed to wonder whether or not their future conduct falls within the scope or boundaries of the injunction (ICI at 259)". In my view, while the injunctive relief sought against Kioussis is expressed in the short minutes with, great particularity, it suffers from a lack of definition of Kioussis' relevant "ability, capacity or intention to fulfil (certain) representations", it involves questions of knowledge on the part of the enjoined party and, particularly in relation to injunctions against the making of representations set out in sub pars 16 (v) - (viii), (x) and (xi) of the short minutes, the subject matter, in my opinion, is quite unworkable in the context of injunctive relief.

The difficulty in framing appropriate relief is, to a large extent, inherent in the nature of the conduct of the Venture group as found in these proceedings. A cursory reading of my reasons of 10 December 1996 should leave the reader in no doubt of the strength of my views as to the reprehensible conduct of the Venture group, with the only qualification lying in my comment concerning the possible influence of Kioussis over P Kioussis. In brief, I have described the conduct of Venture and Kioussis as predatory, a description which, I think, sums up the nature of the proscribed conduct more particularly found against Venture and in which Kioussis and P Kioussis were involved. It is my view that it is almost impossible to extract particular elements from the proscribed conduct as found against Venture for the purpose of making them the subject of restraint which would match the mischief involved in that conduct.

I am strengthened in this view by the evidence which was given in these proceedings on behalf of the Commission relevant to the injunctive relief sought by it against the Venture group. It is clear from that evidence that over a period from 17 January 1994 to 29 August 1994 the Venture Group (a) gave "an unequivocal undertaking" to the Federal Court that they would "not contravene any of the Sections of the Building Services [Corporation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1989154/) and (would) not re-enter the residential building market unless and until such time as the
Building Services Corporation" restored their respective licences under that
Act: (b) gave an assurance to the Federal Court that Kioussis had "surrendered whatever right he had to become involved in domestic building, and (that he had) not participated in domestic building for some two years" prior to 1
February 1994: (c) in written submissions to the Federal Court by counsel acting on their behalf, the Venture group reaffirmed the "unequivocal undertakings that unless and until they (were) duly and properly licensed under the Building Services [Corporation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1989154/), 1989 , they (would) not be involved in co-ordinating or supervising any "residential building work" and/or specialist work" and further assured the Court that "(f)or all intents and purposes for some two years now (they had) not been involved in or involved in co-ordinating or supervising "residential building work" and/or "specialist work", or "acting in any supervisory capacity": (d) by their counsel on 18 May 1994, those undertakings were further reaffirmed to the Federal Court and reliance was placed upon similar, though more extensive, undertakings offered to the solicitor for the Commission by their solicitor's letter of 19 March 1994 and (e) on 29 August 1994, in the Federal Court proceedings, those undertakings were reaffirmed by their counsel in the following terms: "There have been undertakings and to go and litigate those issues in this court constitutes nothing more than a harassment, and we would give your
Honour the details. We say that 21/2 years have passed since any of my clients have been involved in any domestic building operations. We say that Mr Harry
Kioussis' licence and that of Penny's and the company - I use the word licence in broad terms - have been taken away from them. They cannot lawfully carry on any domestic building operations.

They have undertaken to your Honour not to do so , unless they are relicensed in due course, if that every happens. Then there is an undertaking that they will give my learned friend or his client notice, and his client can then move. We say to your Honour, why must we spend tens of thousands of dollars on injunction proceedings in the light of these undertakings?" (Annexure G to Exhibit BZ) 
On 9 March 1995 the Venture group's undertakings were reaffirmed to this Court in these proceedings.

In contrast with those undertakings and assurances the fact was that in the second half of 1993 to mid 1994 Kioussis and P Kioussis were engaged in residential building works through the medium of a company known as Builtco
Construction Management Pty Limited (Builtco), which, presumably, held a building license, using the supervisor's licence of one Joseph Constantin .

Alec Pappas (Pappas) was an architect who was engaged in such works during that period. Pappas gave evidence that he was approached by P Kioussis in early September 1993, introducing herself in the following way: " "My name in Penny Kioussis and I am from the Builtco Construction
Management. Here is my card. I was in the area. We are going around introducing ourselves to architects. If you've got anything for us we are happy to quote".

The card described Penny Kioussis as "Contract Administrator Builtco
Construction Management Pty Ltd". Which was described as "Specialising in all types of Building Work COMMERCIAL - INDUSTRIAL - DOMESTIC".

Pappas described a further conversation he had with P Kioussis, a "few days" after his introduction to her, in the following terms: " "It is Alec Pappas here. I have a client who wants to build dual occupancy units at Bankstown, and he has been using a builder to price on my drawings for the job. Were you the builder doing that pricing?" 
She replied words to the effect of "Yes, I know your client, we have been doing the pricing on that job. Isn't that a coincidence".

We agreed that it was a coincidence that she did her "random" visit in my area. I then said words to the effect of:- "I am finishing the documentation on the Bankstown dual occupancy project. The final drawings on the project are nearly complete. When they are ready I will invite Builtco to submit a formal tender on the project".

Penny replied "All right". " 
Builtco tendered for the Bankstown residential work in writing under the signature of Kioussis.

In November 1993 Builtco successfully tendered for another residential building (the Mortdale works) for which Pappas had been retained as architect.
P Kioussis signed the contract for the Mortdale works as a director of Builtco having "the authority to sign contract agreements". The Mortdale works were carried out under the supervision of P Kioussis who assured Pappas that
Kioussis regularly visited the site, that she "closely worked" with him and that Kioussis knew "exactly" what she did. Throughout the works Pappas had discussions with Kioussis on construction problems. To the observation of
Pappas, Kioussis "was in charge and ... generally supervised P Kioussis".

In December 1993 Kioussis submitted to Pappas a quotation for other residential works (the Croydon works) and with P Kioussis attended a pre- contract meeting with Pappas and his clients to discuss prices. Before securing this contract Kioussis showed Pappas and his clients other residential work at Strathfield which he had "recently extended and renovated". As to his experience in such work he stated to the clients of
Pappas: "I love building homes. I'll look after you. I am very experienced. I've been building for over twenty years. I've done millions of dollars worth of building work." 
P Kioussis signed the contract for the Croydon works. As in the case of the
Mortdale works, Kioussis engaged in discussions with Pappas over construction problems and P Kioussis supervised the Croydon works when construction got under way.

As a result of building problems encountered on site at the Croydon works,
Pappas made enquiries of the Corporation concerning licences issued under the
BSC Act to Builtco and P Kioussis. As a result of that enquiry Pappas telephoned P Kioussis and had the following conversation with her: "AP "I have been informed by Burwood Council that you are not licensed. What is happening?" 
PK "I had a meeting with the Council this morning. We had a misunderstanding because I told them I was the supervisor. This is what has caused the problem." 
AP "Well, who is Joseph Constantin? I have never heard him mentioned before?" 
PK "Joseph Constantin is another director of Builtco that mainly works on our other projects. But don't worry, I am closely supervised by my father on this job and he is the most experienced in our company with building work".

AP "Are you "Penelope" who is listed with the BSC?" 
PK "Yes". " 
In June 1994 the unfavourable publicity which the Venture group attracted came to the notice of Pappas who arranged a meeting between his clients and
Kioussis, P Kioussis and Constantin. At that meeting, which took place on 11
June 1994, the following discussion took place: "(The Architect) "Is Builtco licensed or not? If Harry isn't licensed why is he supervising the job? Who is Joseph Constantin and why has he never been mentioned or had dealings with the job in any way? Are your current contractors licensed and were any of the contractors on your current jobs involved in any way with the problems which (were) shown on television?" "My licence was cancelled unfairly, on a technicality. We are taking the BSC to Court over this issue and I will have my licence back soon, believe me. Builtco is licensed and Joseph is the supervisor and does periodically visit all of our sites including Croydon. I assure you that although I technically don't have a licence at the present time I am very experienced and know all about building. The families reported on the television are part of a conspiracy against me and are involved in insurance fraud. I can't talk too much about it now but we are in the process of exposing them and clearing my name. None of our current contractors had involvement with the projects shown on television and all or current contractors are licensed." (P Kioussis) "My father has been working for many years on millions of dollars worth of projects. We can show you many successful projects with satisfied clients over the years. People don't look at those. My father's money has been achieved from many years of hard work and success." " 
Following this meeting Kioussis was permitted to continue with the Croydon works. However, the contract was terminated in July 1994 when Pappas was informed that Builtco was no longer licensed under the BSC Act.

For the most part, correspondence from Builtco to Pappas during the performance of the Mortdale and Croydon works was under the hand of P
Kioussis.

No explanation has ever been offered to this Court by Kioussis or P Kioussis of these departures from the several assurances given to the Federal Court and to this Court from time to time.

I am satisfied that the protection afforded to the community by the provisions of the BSC Act is insufficient to reasonably protect the community form the conduct as found against the Venture group in these proceedings. I consider their conduct, reveals a willingness to circumvent the provisions of that Act by a recourse to licenses issued to others under that Act. Appropriate injunctive relief to meet the conduct of the Venture group would need to take a form that precludes the Venture group having a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the activities of any organisation which activities require the licensing of such a person under the BSC Act, excluding such an interest through or in a listed corporation. It is my view that such restraint is the only appropriate restraint which would have the effect of counteracting the predatory proscribed conduct of the Venture group as found in these proceedings. Although there was no evidence of Venture acting in breach of undertakings I see that as no obstacle to such relief being ordered against
Venture under the Act. I would not regard it as inappropriate for such relief to be indefinite as to time. An application may be made under <case> of the
Act when appropriate.

I am concerned that relief in this particular form has not been the subject of argument before me and, although I am particularly concerned to see an end to these proceedings, I think it is preferable to permit the parties to present submissions on the appropriateness of such an order.

The injunctive relief sought against the Collings group, I think, suffers from similar deficiencies to that outlined above in relation to the relief sought against the Venture group, in that it involves questions as to the "ability, capacity or intention (of the Collings group) to fulfil (the subject) representations" and involves the subject matter of representations, particularly those set out in sub-pars 13 (iv) - (xv), which is either ambiguous or not reasonably capable of enforcement by way of injunctive relief.

In relation to the Collings group's involvement in the proscribed conduct of
Venture, in large measure, I consider that it is not amenable to injunctive relief. I think it is highly unlikely that that conduct will be repeated.
While that may not necessarily preclude the ordering of injunctive relief, having regard particularly to sub-sections 80(4) and (5) of the Act, I think that fact is pertinent to the exercise of my discretion. The central mischief as found by me in the conduct of the Collings group lay in the misleading structuring of contractual relations and in the form of contract which placed an unreasonable and deceptive reliance upon provisional sum items which, together with the use of superseded drawings, exposed the consumers to exploitation at the hands of Venture. To a certain extent, I accept the statements of Collings that these matters have been addressed by him. The difficulty in making the form of contract and the structuring of contractual relations the subject of injunctive relief which would be effective and unambiguous is such that, while I accept that there is a public interest at stake which may justify the granting of injunctive relief against the Collings group, I am of the view that no such orders should be made.

Interest 
The short minutes have calculated interest (a) on the amounts paid by the owners to Collings Construction and Venture, from the respective dates of the last payments to Venture by the owners (except in the case of the Quaglias where interest has been calculated from the date of the last payment to Collings Construction) and (b) on the balance of damages, from the date of institution of the Federal Court proceedings. It has been submitted on behalf of the respondents that interest should run, alternatively, from the date of my findings of proscribed conduct; from the dates when the consents were given pursuant to <case>(1B) of the Act; from the date of the adoption by this Court of the referee's report and from the date when, it was asserted, the Commission particularised its case. None of these contentions have any merit in my opinion. I consider that the relevant time for the purpose of considering the ordering of interest on damages is from the date when the cause of action arose in the claims by the owners. By taking the last date of payments to Venture (in the case of Quaglia, to Collings Construction), I am of the opinion that the Commission has selected times by which the respective causes of action had arisen. In calculating interest from the date of the institution of the Federal Court proceedings on the balance of damages found to be payable by the respondents, the Commission has adopted what, in my opinion, is a conservative basis for the calculation of such interest. Accordingly findings as to interest should be made in accordance with the short minutes.

Costs 
The Commission contends that the defendants should be ordered to pay costs on an indemnity basis on the alternative grounds that: (1) the respondents persisted in the maintenance of protracted proceedings in a case without merit and (2) the respondents rejected an offer of compromise by the Commission which was in terms less favourable to the Commission than under the findings I have made in these proceedings. The offer of compromise was made pursuant to Pt 22 of the Supreme Court Rules and the Commission relied upon the provisions of Pt 52A r 22. 
I do not regard these proceedings as falling within the category of those cases that are so lacking in merit as to require some response by the Court on the question of costs. It is true that the findings I have made have been expressed with some firmness accompanied by the use of language highly critical of some aspects of the respondents' conduct. However, I do not regard that as inconsistent with the right of a litigant to assert a defence to proceedings, especially where, in the case of the Collings group, there are strongly contested factual issues. I think it also is relevant to the consideration of this ground that the respondents participated in a reference, the terms of which, I think, permitted the resolution of technical factual issues within a time frame which would have been greatly extended had those issues been litigated in a more contentious manner. I think it is also relevant that Venture and Kioussis made some concession as to liability. While that concession was inadequate for the proper determination of the issues in the proceedings as to liability, I regard the concession as relevant to this question of costs. Accordingly I do not regard this ground for indemnity costs as having been made out.

On 4 July 1995 the Commission made an offer of compromise pursuant to Pt 22 of the Supreme Court Rules in the following terms: "The Plaintiff offers to compromise its claims in these proceedings as follows: 
PAYMENT by the Defendants, for claims which the Plaintiff has brought on behalf of the consumers named in paragraph 2 of the Amended Application dated May 1994 in these proceedings, in the total sum of $635,000.00.

ORDERS of the Court, by consent, in the nature of permanent injunctions in terms as sought in the Amended Application (alternatively, in terms that the Court considers appropriate), as regards each Defendants respectively (including, but not limited to, paragraph 9C as against the Third Defendant).

DECLARATION by the Court, by consent, as against the Third Defendant, in the terms of paragraph 9A(i) of the Amended Application.
 
This Offer of Compromise is made pursuant to Part 22 of the Rules of the
Supreme Court." 
Notwithstanding the fact that the quantum which the Commission was prepared to accept was significantly less than the amounts in respect of which I have found the respondents liable, I do not think it appropriate to award indemnity costs pursuant to Pt 52A r 22. The basis for this rejection of the
Commission's ground for indemnity costs lies in the terms of par (ii) of the offer. In my opinion, it is unsatisfactory to make an offer of compromise which is open ended in the terms of an acceptance requiring defendants to abide by any "terms that the Court considers appropriate". Moreover, the terms of the injunction proposed by the Commission I have found to be ambiguous in part and unworkable in a number of respects. Accordingly, I have come to the conclusion that the Commission's costs should be on the usual basis. In ordering costs of the proceedings I include the costs of the reference.

It was submitted on behalf of J Collings that the correct form of the order in her favour should be in the form of a judgment and that costs should be on an indemnity basis. The basis for this latter contention was the making of a
Calderbank offer of settlement by the Collings group by facsimile dated 30
June 1995 from their solicitor to the solicitor for the Commission. I do not think it is necessary to set out the terms of that offer in full. It was one which made an offer of payment of $65,000, offered "permanent undertakings to the Court in a form to be agreed" and made provision for costs, interest and the discharge of orders previously made by Wilcox J in the Federal Court proceedings. I think it is quite clear from the terms of that offer that it was not one made severally so as to enable the Commission to accept the offer by one and continue with the proceedings against the others in the Collings group. In my opinion, the offer affords no sufficient basis for awarding costs other than on the usual basis. As to the terms of the order for costs to which
J Collings is entitled, I do not propose to make any order other than the usual order. The Commission had proposed that such an order should be qualified as follows: "The Plaintiff pay to the Fifth Defendant such costs as are solely referable to her defence of these proceedings." 
In my opinion, it is sufficient to order the payment of J Colling's costs by the Commission, leaving the assessment of party and party costs to be made in accordance with the provisions of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/), in particular [ss
F](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208f.html) and [208G](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208g.html).
For the assistance of the assessor of such costs I make the following observations. There is no doubt that the vast body of evidence given in these proceedings and before the referee did not directly implicate J Collings. That evidence was primarily directed, in the case of the Collings group, against
Collings Construction and Collings. It is also the fact that throughout these proceedings there was a considerable amount of manoeuvring by Collings
Construction and Collings which involved, at different times, Collings acting in person while counsel at different times acted on behalf of one or other of the Collings group. I think it is also relevant to observe that the Commission maintained throughout these proceedings a case against J Collings and there is no doubting the seriousness of those allegations nor the importance of this litigation to her. I consider that she was entitled to have legal representation throughout the proceedings, if not during the reference. To some extent I consider that there was an overlapping of representation at different times on behalf of the Collings group. In periods when Collings appeared in person it was obvious that there remained a level of common interest in his conduct of the proceedings and that of counsel on behalf of J
Collings. I consider the final written submissions of counsel for J Collings reflect some measure of the overlapping nature of representations within the
Collings group.

Stay of Proceedings 
The Venture group seek a stay of proceedings. In my opinion no basis for such a stay has been established. The basis for the application is that the Venture group propose to appeal from my decision upon grounds as to quantum which, it is submitted, involve contentious questions, principally of law, and upon the basis that, if the judgment is satisfied prior to the outcome of a successful appeal, the Venture group will be denied the fruits of that appeal by their inability to recover the damages so paid to the owners. I accept that my findings as to quantum involve some difficult questions upon which judicial minds may differ markedly. However, in my opinion, that alone is no sufficient basis for the granting of a stay pending the outcome of an appeal in proceedings which have now occupied some three and a quarter years since their institution and in respect of which the Venture group pursued before the full Federal Court and the High Court challenges to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to hear these proceedings. Those proceedings were disposed of on 30 September 1996 with the question of jurisdiction being left to this Court to decide in these proceedings.

While I am prepared to accept that the owners are persons of comparatively modest financial resources, I do not think it follows that the Venture group would be deprived of the fruits of a successful appeal by reason of the inability of those persons to repay damages paid by the Venture group in these proceedings. In particular, I am of the opinion that the damages adjudged by me to be payable by the Venture group are payable to the Commission and that any required repayment of those damages would be required of the Commission.
In that respect, the Commission, by its counsel, has, on instructions, acknowledged that to be the correct position and I have taken that acceptance into consideration in concluding that the Venture group have not made out any acceptable basis for a stay of proceedings pending their appeal from my judgment in these proceedings. I observe that there has been no attempt to place any evidence before me of the inability of any of the Venture group to satisfy the judgments - a matter that must weigh very heavily, in my opinion, against the granting of a stay. There has been ample opportunity afforded to the Venture group to adduce such evidence.

In the case of the Collings group I think it is clear that satisfaction of the judgment by Collings Construction and Collings is beyond their financial capacity and that enforcement of the judgment pending an appeal would probably result in their respective liquidation and bankruptcy. This much is clear from the affidavit of Collings sworn 6 December 1996. However, I do not regard the
Collings group as entitled to an unconditional stay. In my opinion, the evidence as to their liability was quite compelling. As to quantum, as I have stated, I accept that there are a number of arguable issues capable of being raised on appeal which the Collings group propose to explore. However, I do not regard those contentions as touching the liability of the Collings group as to damages assessed upon the basis of payments to Collings Construction by the owners, after the allowance of a reasonable sum representing the value of services and expenses, the benefit of which was taken by those persons. I have some difficulty in seeing how any arguable issue could be raised in respect of that part of the damages adjudged by me to be payable by the Collings group.
That quantum of damages represents a total of $70,081 made up as follows: 
The Corbetts  
The amount paid  $20,128.00  
Benefit of services and expenses  $6,500.00  $13,628.00  
The Quaglias  
The amount paid  $12,572.00  
Benefit of services and expenses 
Nil  $12,572.00  
The Staps  
The amount paid  $12,000.00  
Benefit of services and expenses  $4,500.00  $7,500.00  
The Smiths  
The amount paid  $14,233.00  
Benefit of services and expenses  $5,000.00  $9,233.00  
The Grimstons  
The amount paid  $12,900.00  
Benefit of services and expenses  $5,000.00  $7,900.00  
The Ferrises  
The amount paid  $14,129.00  
Benefit of services and expenses  $5,000.00  $9,129.00  
The Tantis  
The amount paid  $14,619.00  
Benefit of services and expenses  $4,500.00  $10,119.00  
In my opinion any stay should be conditional upon the satisfaction of the amount of $70,081 plus interest as calculated in accordance with the short minutes.

An appropriate form of order follows: "Conditionally upon the first or second defendants paying to the plaintiff the sum of by 28 March 1997 and upon the first or second defendants filing an appeal to this judgment within twenty eight days hereof, execution upon the judgment be stayed against the first and second defendants until determination of those appeals or until further order." 
The amount to be paid by 28 March 1997 should include interest calculated to 7
February 1997.

I note the consent of the Venture group to orders in terms of pars 22, 23 and of the short minutes. I have assumed that those consents were given on the basis that a stay would be granted. In view of my refusal of a stay I think it is inappropriate to make those orders.

I also note that the Collings group consent to an order in terms of par 26(i) of the short minutes. I have assumed that that consent has been given on the basis that a stay be granted. However, any order in terms of par 26(i) of the short minutes should be subject to the exception of a disposition, sale or encumbrance for the purpose of satisfying the condition upon which a stay of execution be granted. Furthermore, the terms of the proposed consent order appear to be inappropriate to current circumstances. I have addressed that matter later in these reasons.

The parties are directed to bring in short minutes of order in accordance with my reasons of 10 December 1996 and these supplementary reasons together with written submissions on the question whether an order in the following terms should be made: "The third, fourth and sixth defendants be restrained from holding a pecuniary interest either directly or indirectly in an organisation offering or performing services to members of the public in respect of which a licence is required to be held under the Building Services [Corporation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1989154/), 1989 for the offering or performing of such services, save in respect of a corporation whose shares are listed on an Australian Stock Exchange." 
The minutes and submissions should be presented by 9:00 am 7 February 1997.
The matter will be listed for judgment at 9:30 am on that date.

The minutes should accommodate the following:
The calculation of interest on the judgment amounts should be calculated to 7 February 1997.
 [2. Par 10] of the short minutes should be amended as follows: "(a) There be judgment for the fifth defendants.

The order of the Federal Court of 18 March 1994 in proceedings number G687 of 1993 as against the fifth defendant be terminated.

The fifth defendant be released from her undertaking given to this Court on 12 April 1996." [3. Pars 13] - 19 of the short minutes should be omitted and orders in the following terms substituted: "The first, second, third, fourth and sixth defendants pay the plaintiff's costs including any reserved costs.

The plaintiff pay the fifth defendant's costs." [4. Pars 21] - 26 of the short minutes should be omitted. If a consent order is to be made in accordance with par 26(i) of the short minutes then the terms of the particular order should be set out as an order of this Court and not as a continuance of the order of the Federal Court and the terms should be modified to accommodate current circumstances and be subject to the disposition of property to satisfy the condition of a stay.
Orders as to pleadings should be included as follows: "The plaintiff be granted leave to amend its application to include particulars of injunctive relief in accordance with the document marked for identification 20.

The first and second defendants be granted leave to amend their defences in accordance with the defences to the third amended application, each dated 2
November 1995, except as to pars 19 and 20 thereof, as to which leave so to amend is refused.

The third, fourth and sixth defendants be granted leave to amend their defences in accordance with the document marked for identification 18 noted by me as amended, save as to pars 38.1, 38.2, 38.3, 38.4, 39.1 and 39.2 thereof, as to which leave to amend is refused." * * *
