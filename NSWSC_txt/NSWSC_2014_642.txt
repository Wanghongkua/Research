EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
These proceedings were commenced by summons in March 2008, supported by an affidavit sworn by Mr Spark, the NSW Crime Commission's then Assistant Director, Financial Investigations, who deposed to his suspicions that the defendants, Mei Ling Huang and Jie Xu, had engaged in serious crime related activity, namely, obtaining money by deception, contrary to <case> of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) , for reasons there explained. 
In March 2009, pursuant to a further summons filed with leave, restraining and other orders were made by Simpson J under <case> and [s 27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s27.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) , in respect of the defendants' interests in certain property.
In October 2012, further forfeiture and unexplained wealth orders were pursued under [s 22](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s22.html) and [s 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) by way of an amended summons. The matter is listed for hearing on 2 June 2014.
The parties now ask the Court to make orders under [s 28A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s28a.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/), following investigations which the Crime Commission indicated that the value of the defendants' unexplained wealth exceeds $475,000 each. The orders require the defendants to pay that sum to the Treasurer and permit specified interests in property of the two defendants to be applied in satisfaction of the unexplained wealth order, in terms agreed. Various consequential orders under [s 10B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10b.html) and [s 12](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s12.html) of the the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/), and [s 101](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) (as to interest) have also been agreed. Various other agreements have been reached, the terms of which are noted in the proposed order.
Having considered the terms of the orders sought, the other agreements which the parties have entered and the circumstances in which they have been reached, I am satisfied that the Court's discretion should be exercised in the terms to which the parties have agreed. 
Accordingly, I make orders in the agreed terms, with the result that the hearing fixed to commence on 2 June 2014 is vacated.
