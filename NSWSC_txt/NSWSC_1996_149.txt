Hamilton & Anor versus Abdilla /96 
Thursday, 23 May 1996 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
McLELLAND CJ in Eq 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: I think that in the strange circumstances that led to this application, and in light of the fact that the plaintiffs concede that they are not entitled to the orders sought, prima facie the defendant should have his costs. The fact that the defendant, through his solicitor, was motivated by a desire to derive some tactical advantage to which he may not have been entitled, seems not really to affect the question of costs, because the fact remains that the plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief sought. On the plaintiffs' side, the position taken up was not justified, in that the correspondence it was sought to challenge the validity of the judgment and the writ on grounds which I think were not maintainable. In all those circumstances the order should be that the summons be dismissed with costs, and that is the order I make.
