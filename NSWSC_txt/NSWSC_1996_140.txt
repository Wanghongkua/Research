SHELLER JA: I agree with Powell JA.
 
POWELL JA: The question for determination in these appeals from a Judgment delivered by Bignold J in the Land and Environment Court on 9th December 1994 is whether a resuming authority, in reliance upon the provisions of the [Land Acquisition (Just Terms Compensation) Act 1991](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/) ("the [Just Terms Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/)") or of the [Valuation of Land Act 1916](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/) ("the [Valuation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/)") or of the two in combination, may object to the determination of the Valuer-General of the amount of compensation to be offered to a person who, in pursuance of the provisions of [Part 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/index.html#p3) of the [Just Terms Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/), is entitled to be paid compensation by the resuming authority in respect of the land proposed to be, or in fact, acquired pursuant to the provisions of the [Just Terms Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/). 
The central facts which have given rise to that question may be stated shortly. They are as follow.

Although it is not entirely clear that this was so, the probability appears to be that Lot 5 in Deposited Plan 809307 and Lot 2 in Deposited Plan 553146 are adjoining lots, Lot 5 having a frontage to both Pacific Highway and
Chamberlain Road, Lisarow and Lot 2 having a frontage only to Chamberlain
Road, Lisarow. At all material times prior to 9th September 1994, the relevance of which date will shortly appear, Lot 5 was owned by Pearl Pastoral
Pty. Limited while Lot 2 was owned by Ms. P. H.C. Seeto.

At sometime prior to 20th May 1994, the Appellant ("the Council") had formed the intention of acquiring both Lot 5 and Lot 2 for open space. Thereafter - but on what date is not clear - the Council gave to each of Pearl Pastoral
Pty. Limited and Ms. Seeto notice of its intention to acquire the respective lots owned by them (Just Terms Act ss.11, 12). Notice of the giving to Pearl
Pastoral Pty. Limited and Ms. Seeto of the proposed acquisition notice appears to have been given to the Valuer-General on 20th May 1994 (Just Terms Act s.18).

Each of Pearl Pastoral Pty. Limited and Ms. Seeto appears to have lodged with the Council a claim for compensation, those claims apparently being lodged on or about 20 July 1994 (Just Terms Act s.39), copies of the claims then being delivered to the Valuer-General by the Council (Just Terms Act s.41).

On 30 August 1994, the Valuer-General forwarded to the Council what was described as a "Valuation Report for Gosford City Council proposed acquisition ..." in respect of each of Lot 5 and Lot 2, the report in each case having apparently been prepared by a Mr. I. Lynar, a registered valuer employed by the Valuer-General in his office at Gosford. Each report concluded: - "VALUATION ADVICE 
This valuation is not to be construed as a determination made pursuant to clause 47 of the [Land Acquisition (Just Terms Compensation) Act 1991](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/). However regard has been had to clause 38 of that Act.
 
Compensation is assessed having regard to the provisions of clause 55 of the Land Acquisition Act disregarding the item of disturbance clause 55(d). The owner has made a claim for .
 
Compensation assessed at ." 
The claim for compensation for disturbance which had been made in respect of Lot 5 was $21,000.00, while the amount of compensation assessed in relation to that lot was $450,000.00. The amount of compensation for disturbance which had been made in respect of Lot 2 was $25,000.00, while the amount of compensation assessed in respect of that lot was $500,000.00.

The Council's declaration that it was acquiring Lots 5 and 2 by compulsory process (Just Terms Act s.19) was published in the New South Wales Government
Gazette on 9th September 1994, on which day the two lots were, by force of the [Just Terms
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/) [(s.20)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/s20.html), vested in the Council freed and discharged from all estates, interests, trusts, restrictions, dedications, reservations, easements, rights, charges, rates and contracts in over or in connection with the two lots. The determination in each case concluded:

On 18th October 1994, the Council's solicitors forwarded to the Valuer-General at his office in Gosford a letter which omitting formal parts was as follows: -
 "RE: GOSFORD CITY COUNCIL and PEARL PASTURES PTY. LTD.

LOT 5 DP 809307 PACIFIC HIGHWAY, LISAROW 
GOSFORD CITY COUNCIL and SEETO 
LOT 2 DP 553146 CHAMBERLAIN ROAD, LISAROW 
We wish to advise that we act for the owner of the above mentioned properties, Gosford City Council. We now enclose: - 
Notice of Objection together with annexed valuation objected to in relation to Lot 5 DP 809307 Pacific Highway, Lisarow; 
Notice of Objection together with annexed valuation objected to in relation to Lot 2 DP 553146 Chamberlain Road, Lisarow.
 
These objections are made pursuant to [Part 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/index.html#p3) of the [Valuation of Land Act 1916](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/) No. 2.
 
For more abundant caution, we also advise that we have this day despatched to the Land and Environment Court for filing, an Application Class 3. We enclose a copy of that Application. This course of action is taken to protect the Council's rights under [Section 38](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/s38.html) of the [Valuation of Land Act 1916](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/). Because of uncertainty and apparent conflict between [Part 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/index.html#p4) of the Act and the Land and Environment Court Rules (and indeed Part 3 of the Regulations) and again in order to protect the Council's rights, you are requested to refer the objections to the Land and Environment Court should that course be found to be appropriate." 
The first Notice of Objection referred to in that letter commenced: "NOTICE OF OBJECTION 
OBJECTION IS HEREBY MADE TO THE VALUATION ANNEXED 
FOR LOT 5 DP 809307" and concluded - "The amount I contend to be correct is: 
Valuation of interest $25.000.00 
The reason for my contentions are: . Lack of viable uses for the subject land apart from a buffer to adjoining land.
 . The underlying zoning of the land.
 . The location and present lack of access to the land.
 . The land is subject to flooding.
 . The land is subject to significant environmental constraints including SEPP 19.
 . Comparable sales.
 . The lack of or limited development potential because of the unlikelihood of obtaining approval for erection of a dwelling.
 . Limited agricultural usages." while the second Notice of Objection referred to in that letter commenced: - "NOTICE OF OBJECTION 
OBJECTION IS HEREBY MADE TO THE VALUATION ANNEXED 
FOR LOT 2 DP553146" and concluded - "The amount I contend to be correct is: 
Valuation of interest $50,000.00 - assuming no approval obtainable for a dwelling.

Valuation of interest $150,000.00 - assuming an approval obtainable for a dwelling.
 
The reason for my contentions are: - . The underlying zoning of the land.
 . The location of the land.
 . The land is subject to flooding.
 . The land is subject to significant environmental constraints including SEPP 19.
 . Comparable sales.
 . The lack of or limited development potential because of the unlikelihood of obtaining approval for the erection of a dwelling." 
In each case, the "Valuation Annexed" referred to was the form of determination of compensation which had been forwarded to the Council by the Valuer-General on 6th October 1994.

The "Application Class 3" which commenced each of the proceedings, the subject of these appeals, was (omitting the detail under "situation of subject land") in the following form: - "Full name of applicant (whether appellant, objector, claimant or referring authority.)

Annex copy of the application to, and letter from, Council or other body stating its decision or state why copies cannot be annexed." 
Each of the Applications was made returnable, in the first instance, on 16th November 1994 before the Registrar of the Land and Environment Court.

The appeal papers do not disclose whether, before 18th October 1994, or 9th
December 1994 when the Notices of Motion which had been filed in each proceeding on behalf of the Valuer-General came before Bignold J, the Council had given to either or both of Pearl Pastoral Pty. Limited or Ms. Seeto the form of notice of compensation entitlement and offer of compensation provided for in Part 3 Division 3 of the [Just Terms
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/) [(ss.42](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/s42.html), [43](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/s43.html)).

At some time, which is not revealed by the appeal papers, but which could well have been the 1st December 1994, there was filed in each proceeding a Notice of Motion in which the Valuer-General sought an order that the application be struck out as incompetent. Those applications, as I had earlier indicated, came before Bignold J on 9th December 1994.

Although it would appear that the Valuer-General had originally sought to support the Notice of Motion in each case upon two grounds: "1. That a determination by the Valuer-General of the amount of compensation to be offered pursuant to the [Just Terms Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/) was not susceptible to the objection and appeal processes provided for in the [Valuation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/); and . That even if such a determination was susceptible of such processes, there having been no decision by him in respect of the Council's purported objections, the right of appeal conferred upon an objector by the provisions of [s.38(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/s38.html) of the [Valuation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/) had not arisen prior to the filing of the application;" the fact that the second ground could readily be overcome led the parties to seek the Court's determination of the validity of the first - and fundamental - objection upon which the Valuer-General relied.

In the event, Bignold J concluded that the Valuer-General's determinations of the amount of compensation payable under the [Just Terms
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/) were not relevantly "valuations" for the purposes of the [Valuation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/), or more particularly "valuations" which were susceptible to the objection and appeal processes provided for in [Parts ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/index.html#p3) and [4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/index.html#p4) of the [Valuation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/), and, that being so, he ordered in each proceeding that the application be struck out and that the Council pay the Valuer-General's costs.

In the Amended Notice of Appeal which was later filed on its behalf, the
Council sought to rely on the following grounds: - "1. His Honour erred in law in holding that the valuation carried out by the Respondent was not one to which [Section 31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/s31.html) of the [Valuation of Land Act 1916](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/) applied.
 . His Honour erred in law in holding that the Respondent's actions in making a determination pursuant to [Section 47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/s47.html) of the [Land Acquisition (Just Terms Compensation) Act, 1991](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/) emanate exclusively from the Respondent's duties and functions under that Act.
 . His Honour erred in law in holding that the proceedings appealed from were incompetent because they did not involve any relevant objection or appeal under the [Valuation of Land Act 1916](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/).
 . His Honour erred in law in holding that a determination pursuant to [Section 68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/s68.html) of the [Valuation of Land Act 1916](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/) did not involve a valuation by the Respondent." 
When the appeal was called on for hearing, Mr. W.R. Davison SC appeared with Mr. S.J. Brockwell and Ms. S.A. Duggan for the Council, while Mr. J.A. Ayling appeared for the Valuer-General.

Reduced to their most simple form, Mr. Davison's submissions proceeded along the following lines: - the duty imposed on the Valuer-General to undertake the determination of compensation is imposed by each of the [Just Terms
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/) [(s.47)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/s47.html) and the [Valuation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/) [(s.68(1))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/s68.html); it followed, so the submission ran, that any determination of compensation is to be undertaken in compliance with the provisions of both Acts and not in compliance with the provisions of one Act exclusively; it was clear, so the submission ran, that, in order that the compensation to be offered be determined, a valuation of the relevant land must first be undertaken (reference was made to the provisions of [ss.55](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/s55.html), [56](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/s56.html) of the [Just Terms
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/)); support for that submission was provided by the fact that the heading to [s.68(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/s68.html) of the [Valuation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/) is "Valuation for Compulsory Acquisition"; .
[s.31(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/s31.html) of the [Valuation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/) provides that any public taxing or rating authority may object to any valuation and is not limited - or, at least, in terms, is not limited - to valuations undertaken for rating or tax purposes; support for the submission that the words "any valuation" should not be so limited is provided by the fact that the [Valuation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/) does contain provisions [(ss.67](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/s67.html), [68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/s68.html), ) for the making of valuations otherwise than for rating or tax purposes.

It is convenient here to set out what seem to me to be the relevant provisions of both the [Just Terms
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/) and the [Valuation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/). They are as follow: - [JUST TERMS ACT](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/) . An authority of the State must, as soon as practicable after giving a proposed acquisition notice, notify the Valuer-General of the proposed acquisition notice.
 ..........
 . An owner of an interest in land which is divested, extinguished or diminished by an acquisition notice is entitled to be paid compensation in accordance with this Part by the authority of the State which acquired the land.
 ..........
 (1) A person who wishes to claim compensation under this Part must lodge a claim in accordance with this section with the authority of the State that is acquiring the land concerned.
 ...........
 (1) An authority of the State must, as soon as practicable after receiving a claim for compensation in respect of a compulsory acquisition (or proposed compulsory acquisition), give the Valuer-General a copy of the claim.
 
The Valuer-General may determine the amount of compensation to be offered to a former owner of land for a compulsory acquisition of the land: before or after the acquisition takes effect; and even though the former owner has not made a claim for the compensation.
 (1) An authority of the State which has compulsorily acquired land under this Act must, within 30 days after the publication of the acquisition notice, give the former owners of the land written notice of the compulsory acquisition, their entitlement to compensation and the amount of compensation offered (as determined by the Valuer-General).
 . A compensation notice given to a former owner of land must: ..........
 state that the owner is entitled to compensation; and offer to pay a specified amount of compensation as determined by the Valuer-General and be accompanied by form of deed of release and indemnity for completion if the offer is accepted; and inform the owner of the right to object to the amount offered.
 ..........
 . The Valuer-General is to determine the amount of compensation to be offered to a person under this Part.
 ..........
 (1) The amount of compensation to which a person is entitled under this Part is such amount as, having regard to all relevant matters under this Part, will justly compensate the person for the acquisition of the land.
 ...........
 . In determining the amount of compensation to which a person is entitled, regard must be had to the following matters only (as assessed in accordance with this Division): the market value of the land on the date of its acquisition; any special value of the land to the person on the date of its acquisition; any loss attributable to severance; any loss attributable to disturbance; solatium; any increase or decrease in the value of any other land of the person at the date of acquisition which adjoins or is severed from the acquired land by reason of the carrying out of, or the proposal to carry out, the public purpose for which the land was acquired.
 . (1) In this Act: `market value' of land at any time means the amount that would have been paid for the land if it had been sold at that time by a willing but not anxious seller to a willing but not anxious buyer .....
 ...........
 (1) A person who has claimed compensation under this Part may, within 90 days after receiving a compensation notice, lodge with the Land and Environment Court an objection to the amount of compensation offered by the authority of the State.
 
If any such objection is duly lodged, the Land and Environment Court is to hear and dispose of the person's claim for compensation.
 ..........
 [VALUATION ACT](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/) 
A. (1) The land value of land is the capital sum which the fee-simple of the land might be expected to realise if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bona-fide seller would require, assuming that the improvements, if any, thereon or appertaining thereto, other than land improvements, and made or acquired by the owner or his predecessor in title had not been made.
 
Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1), in determining the land value of any land it shall be assumed that: the land may be used, or may continue to be used, for any purpose for which it was being used, or for which it could be used, at the date to which the valuation relates; and such improvements may be continued or made on the land as may be required in order to enable the land to continue to be so used, but nothing in this subsection prevents regard being had, in determining that value, to any other purpose for which the land may be used on the assumption that the improvements, if any, other than land improvements, referred to in subsection (1) had not been made.
 ...........
 . A valuation shall as soon as practicable be made by the Valuer-General of the land, improved, and assessed annual value of all lands other than lands of the Crown, and of such lands of the Crown as the Valuer-General thinks proper to include in such valuation: ...........
 (1) A valuation roll shall as soon as practicable be prepared for each district, and shall be in such form as the Valuer-General decides, and in it shall be set forth (so far as is practicable) in respect of each valuation of land the following particulars: ..........
 
The land value of the land.
 ..........
 . A new valuation may be made by the Valuer-General at any time with respect to any parcel or portion of any parcel of land or any stratum or any portion or the whole of any district; and such new valuations shall be so made whenever necessary in order that the valuation rolls shall, as nearly as may be, represent correct values and ownership of all the lands and strata entered therein.
 .........
 (1) The following persons, that is to say: the holder of an estate in fee simple; the mortgagee in possession; and any lessee who is liable to pay rates, may, by notice in or to the effect of a form approved by the Valuer-General and on payment of the prescribed fee require the Valuer-General to make a new valuation of his land or of his estate or interest therein, as the case may be; and in any such case the new valuation shall be entered in the valuation roll.
 ..........
 (1) The Valuer-General shall give to the owner of a freehold estate whether in possession or otherwise in land (whether or not any stratum is comprised therein) notice of all valuations under this Act in respect of such land or stratum stating that such owner may lodge with the Valuer-General written objection to any such valuation within such time as is stated in such notice.
 ...........
 
A person to whom the Valuer-General has given written notice under subsection (1), (2) or (3) may lodge with the Valuer-General written objection to any such valuation within such time as is stated in such notice.
 ..........
 (1) Any public taxing or rating authority may within the prescribed time object to any valuation, and shall at the same time give notice (in a form approved by the Valuer-General) of such objection to every owner or occupier who is liable for any rates or taxes which may be payable to such authority in respect of the land or stratum.
 ..........
 (1) On objection being made to any valuation, the Valuer-General may if he see fit alter such valuation and amend the valuation roll accordingly or disallow such objection.
 
The Valuer-General shall give written notice of any such altered valuation or of his disallowance of the objection to the objector and to any other person who is entitled to a notice of valuation under section 29.
 ..........
 (1) An objector or other person referred to in section 35(1) who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Valuer-General on an objection made to the Valuer-General under Part 3 may, within the time and in the manner provided by the rules of the Court, appeal to the Court against that decision.
 ..........
 (1) Each year the Valuer-General shall furnish to the Board of Fire Commissioners an estimate of the aggregated land values that would most likely result if a general valuation were to be made (as at 1 July of the year preceding the year in which the estimate is furnished) of all rateable land within any area constituted as a fire district under [section 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fba1989112/s5.html) of the [Fire Brigades Act 1989](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/fba1989112/).
 ..........
 (1) The Valuer-General is to determine, in accordance with the [Land Acquisition (Just Terms Compensation) Act 1991](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/), the amount of compensation to be offered to an owner of land for a compulsory acquisition of the land under that Act.
 
Any such determination does not affect, and is not affected by, any valuation of land made by the Valuer-General under this or any other Act.
 ..........
 (1) The Valuer-General shall, on application (in a form approved by the Valuer-General) made by any person who has or had an estate or interest in the land or stratum at the date at which he requires the valuation made and on payment of the prescribed fee, make a fresh valuation to determine the value of any land or stratum or any estate or interest in the land or stratum as the case may require at a date before or after the date of the making of the last valuation of such land or stratum under this act.
 
This subsection shall apply only to applications made for valuations to be used for any of the purposes mentioned in this Part.
 
Any such new valuation shall be subject to objection in like manner as in the case of other valuations under this Act.
 ............" 
Despite the care with which, in his usual fashion, Mr. Davison advanced and developed his submissions, I have concluded that they ought not to be accepted.

A comparison of the various provisions of the [Just Terms
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/) and the [Valuation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/) which I have set out above in my view makes tolerably plain the following: - the concept of "land value" which is to be determined for the purposes of the [Valuation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/) differs from the concept of "the amount of compensation" which is to be determined for the purposes of the [Just Terms
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/); matters to which regard has to be had in determining, on the one hand, land value and, on the other, the amount of compensation differ; the purposes - rating and taxation - for which land value is to be determined differ from the purposes - the offer, or payment, to be made in respect of land compulsorily acquired - for which the amount of compensation is to be determined. Contrary to Mr. Davison's submissions: [s.67](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/s67.html) of the [Valuation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/) does not require the making of a valuation but requires only "an estimate of the aggregated land values that would most likely result if a general valuation were to be made ... of all rateable land within any area"; [s.68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/s68.html) of the [Valuation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/) does not require the determination of "land value", a fact which is made clear by the provisions of sub-s. 2; while s.70 of the [Valuation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/) provides for the making of a valuation, not every valuation which is made may be entered on the valuation roll - only those valuations which are made as at a date after the date of the valuation entered on the valuation roll may be so entered on the valuation roll;
In contrast to the position under the [Valuation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/) which provides for objections - to be determined, in the first instance, by the
Valuer-General - by both rateable persons [(ss.29(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/s29.html), , (4)) and any public taxing or rating authority [(s.31(1))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/s31.html) and provides for an appeal to the court only by an objector who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Valuer-General on the objection [(s.38(1))](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/s38.html) the [Just Terms
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/) confers a right to object to the amount of compensation offered by the resuming authority only upon "a person who has claimed compensation", which objection is to be lodged with the Court, which is then "to hear and dispose of the (objector's) claim for compensation".

The scheme of, and the rights and obligations conferred or imposed by, the two
Acts differing in the respects which I have set out above, it follows, in my view, that when, as in the case of these proceedings, what is required is the determination of the amount of compensation to be offered or paid in respect of land compulsorily required, it is to the provisions of the [Just Terms
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/), rather than the provisions of the Valuation Act,which one must have regard. This being so, it follows that, as Bignold J determined, the determinations which were made by the Valuer-General were not susceptible to the objection and appeal processes provided for in the [Valuation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vola1916173/).

Although, in my view, this result is clear, it may be that this apparently anomalous result was not intended by the Parliament. This being so, I would suggest that the Court's judgment in these proceedings be drawn to the attention of the Government, or of the relevant Minister or Ministers, so that consideration might be given to the question whether, in the light of the
Court's judgment in these proceedings, some amendment of the [Just Terms
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/latca1991442/) is called for.

For the reasons which I have set out above, I would propose that the appeal be dismissed with costs.
