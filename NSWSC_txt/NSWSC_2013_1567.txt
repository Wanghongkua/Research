Catchwords: 
PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE - application for a stay of a writ of possession - no question of principle  
JUDGMENT 2 (18/10/13)
This is a matter of the National Australia Bank Limited and Octagon Financial Services Pty Ltd.
At about 5.15pm yesterday I dismissed the first defendant's application for a further stay of execution of the writ of possession issued pursuant to orders of this court on 4th July 2013. I will not repeat the reasons I gave at that time for making that order.
This morning the matter has been restored to the list and Ms Bethanie Tobin, who occupies the premises with her husband and two children, has renewed the application for a stay and has provided additional material which was not available to me yesterday afternoon. In particular Miss Tobin has indicated to me in court today that she accepts the decision made yesterday afternoon but given her hope that the order would have been otherwise, she has not made the necessary arrangements for herself and her children to vacate the premises today.
Her husband, who is the person who controlled the business of Octagon Financial Services, is currently overseas but is returning over the weekend and understandably she requires his assistance to vacate the premises with their children.
The material matter however is that Ms Tobin has offered her personal undertaking to the court on her own behalf and on behalf of her husband, that the family will vacate the premises by 10am on Tuesday 22nd October 2013 and surrender possession of the premises to the plaintiff by that time. 
It may be that they will have been unable to remove their furniture by that time. However, Mr Lewin, who appears on behalf of the plaintiff today, has very fairly said that if I make an order adverse to his client's position, and that is the situation on Tuesday, provided the undertaking is complied with, the bank would facilitate a supervised removal of the furniture at a convenient time arranged between the parties.
I should record that the bank maintains its opposition to any further stay. I acknowledge the bank's entitlement under the judgment made in this Court by Schmidt J to possession of the premises. However, given what I regard as a material change in circumstances, I am prepared to stay the execution of the writ for a short period of time.
Mr Lewin has informed me, in discharge of his obligation of candour to the Court for which I commend him, that he has spoken to the Sheriff and the Sheriff is able to arrange for execution of the writ next Friday, should Ms Tobin breach her undertaking.
Having seen and heard Ms Tobin in court today, I am confident that she will not do so, but I think it appropriate to make the following orders: 
The execution of the writ of possession in favour of the plaintiff on 18
October 2013 at 10.30am be stayed; 
The writ of possession in favour of the plaintiff is to be executed on October 2013 at 9am; 
The requirement to provide the occupiers with notice of the further execution of the writ of possession is dispensed with in accordance with [section
A(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa200585/s7a.html) of the [Sheriff Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sa200585/) ; 
These orders are made on the basis of Ms Bethanie Tobin's undertaking to the Court, on her own behalf and on behalf of her husband, that she will provide vacant possession of the premises located at XXXXXXXX to the plaintiff by 10am on Tuesday 22 October 2013.
