JUDGMENT
By Amended Originating Process filed by leave on 3 February 2014, the Plaintiff, Ms Marise Segelov, seeks an order under [s 601AH(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ah.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") reinstate the registration of Wiamera Pty Ltd (ACN 000 877 494) (deregistered) ("Company"). Ms Segelov also seeks an order, under [ss 482](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s482.html) and [511](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s511.html)(1)(b) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) that, immediately following the Company's reinstatement, the members' voluntary liquidation of the Company be terminated. The application is supported by affidavits of Ms Marise Segelov sworn 20 December 2013 and Ms Tanya Segelov sworn 31 January 2014 and 3 February 2014. I made the orders sought by Ms Marise Segelov on 3 February 2014 and these are my reasons for doing so.
The Company was incorporated in March 1971 and, prior to its deregistration in 2005, its shareholders were Ms Marise Segelov and Ms Tanya Segelov, each of whom held 1 ordinary share in the Company. The Company had acquired two lots in a strata plan in March 1976. One of those lots, referable to a home unit, was subsequently transferred to Mr Philip Segelov in September 1990 and, on his death, transferred to Ms Marise Segelov. The other lot, referable to an associated car parking space, remains in the name of the Company. The Company's shareholders, Ms Marise Segelov and Ms Tanya Segelov, resolved that the Company be wound up on 23 December 2003, in a members' voluntary winding up. A statement of account subsequently lodged with ASIC in March 2005 recorded that the Company had no assets or liabilities; it has now emerged that that understanding was in error, because of the Company's interest in the car parking space. A final meeting in the members' voluntary winding up was held on 22 March 2005 and, under [s 509(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s509.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), ASIC deregistered the Company on 24 June 2005. The Company was deregistered by ASIC in June 2005 after the completion of a members' voluntary winding up. 
Ms Marise Segelov's evidence is that she first became aware that the strata lot referable to the car parking space was held in the Company's name when she received a rate notice from Randwick City Council in October 2012, referable to the period 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013, which recorded the fact that that strata lot was owned by the Company. Her evidence is that she had previously understood that that car parking space formed part of the strata lot that had previously been transferred to her, rather than being a separate lot in the strata plan. Ms Segelov now seeks reinstatement of the Company to allow her to make payment of the outstanding rates on behalf of the Company in respect of the car parking space on terms that the Company will transfer that parking space to her in consideration for the payment of those rates. Her evidence is that, after she has attended to that matter and all other affairs of the Company, she will arrange for the members' voluntary liquidation or voluntary deregistration of the Company.
Ms Marise Segelov and Ms Tanya Segelov have executed a Deed Poll dated 20 December 2013 which recites the circumstances of the Company's deregistration and its ownership of the car parking space and its liability to Randwick City Council for outstanding rates, which will total $7,239.97 as at 30 June 2014. That Deed Poll also records the deposit of an amount to the trust account of a firm of solicitors and the execution of an irrevocable authority by Ms Marise Segelov directing that firm of solicitors to transfer that amount in payment of the outstanding council rates in respect of the car parking space, and also records the intent that those monies be paid to the Council in discharge of the outstanding rates, subject to the reinstatement of, and termination of the members' voluntary liquidation of, the Company and in consideration of a transfer of the car parking space by the Company to Ms Marise Segelov. Ms Tania Segelov's further affidavit dated 3 February 2014 provided a further explanation of the manner in which the rates payable to Randwick City Council has been calculated, and confirmed the deposit of an additional amount to the solicitor's trust account so that the amount in that trust account exceeds the amount which would be payable by the Company in respect of rates. 
The Deed Poll also records that Ms Marise Segelov and Ms Tanya Segelov, in their capacities as directors of the Company would, within 6 months, lodge an application for voluntary deregistration of the Company with ASIC. By that Deed Poll, Ms Marise Segelov undertakes to be liable for relevant costs, charges, expenses and other liabilities in respect of these matters and indemnifies the Company in respect of such liabilities; each of Ms Marise Segelov and Ms Tanya Segelov warrant and undertake to do all things necessary as, relevantly, directors and shareholders of the Company to give effect to the terms of the Deed; and Ms Marise Segelov also gives that warranty and undertaking in her individual capacity. 
The liquidator who was formerly appointed to the Company, while it was in voluntary winding up, has consented to his reappointment as liquidator on reinstatement of the Company, albeit that reappointment would be short-lived where an application is also made for termination of the voluntary winding up. Both Ms Marise Segelov and Ms Tanya Segelov consent to act as a director of the Company upon its reinstatement, consistent with the positions which they held prior to its deregistration. 
This application has been served on Randwick City Council and on ASIC. ASIC has advised, by letter dated 30 January 2014, that it does not oppose the application for the Company's reinstatement subject to specified conditions that are in a common form. These include a condition that the Company attends to lodgement of all outstanding documents and payment of all outstanding fees and penalties upon reinstatement and Ms Tanya Segelov, as a director of the Company, has undertaken to do all things necessary to ensure that the Company attends to those matters. 
The Court has power, under [s 601AH](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ah.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), on the application of a person aggrieved by the deregistration of a company, to order that ASIC reinstate the company's registration where it is satisfied that it is just that that occur. I summarised the principles applicable to an application of this kind in Re F&A Henry (Gowrie) Pty Ltd (deregistered) <case> at <case> as follows: "Section 601AH(2) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) provides that the Court may make an order that ASIC reinstate the registration of a company if an application for reinstatement is made to the Court by a person aggrieved by the deregistration and the Court is satisfied that it is just that the Company's registration be reinstated. Matters which are relevant to whether it is just that the Company's registration be reinstated include the circumstances in which the Company was deregistered; the purpose of the reinstatement; the Company's solvency; whether any person is likely to be prejudiced by the reinstatement; and the public interest generally:
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission versus Australian Securities and
Investments Commission <case>; [(2000) 34 ACSR 232]; Callegher versus Australian Securities and Investments
Commission <case>; [(2007) 239 ALR 749.] If the Court makes such an order, it may also make any other order it considers appropriate under [s
AH(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601ah.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/)."
I am satisfied that Ms Marise Segelov is a person aggrieved by the Company's deregistration, since that deregistration would cause a right of value - namely the Company's interest in the car parking space - to be lost and Ms Marise Segelov has a pecuniary interest in reinstating the Company in order to preserve that interest: Arnold World Trading Pty Ltd versus ACN 133 427 335 Pty Ltd <case>; <case> as including the interests of the company's creditors, including future creditors; the interests of the liquidator, particularly with regard to costs; the interests of contributories and the interests of "the public", including the public interest in matters of commercial morality, and the public interest that insolvent companies should be wound up. 
I summarised other matters relevant to such an application, in a similar context to this application, in Re F&A Henry (Gowrie) Pty Limited (deregistered) above at [17], as follows: "Section 511(1)(b) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) in turn authorises the Court to exercise the power to terminate a winding up in a voluntary winding up: McKern versus Pacific Edge Corporation Pty Ltd (in liq)  <case>; [(2004) 51 ACSR 602]; Re St George Bank Ltd  <case> at <case>.
... Subject to the question of the Company's solvency, the Court may otherwise make an order terminating a winding up where a sole shareholder, for reasons of administrative convenience, took steps directed towards ultimate dissolution of the Company at the conclusion of a members' voluntary winding up and, for reasons of the same kind, now wishes to put a stop to the process which it had previously thought would be beneficial: Re St George Bank Ltd above at [11]. I agree with the view expressed by Barrett J in Re St George
Bank that, absent any demonstrated reason why the sole member's wish should not be implemented, the Court, having considered the interests of creditors and any public interest, should be willing to order the termination of a member's voluntary winding up if that is the sole member's wish."
In the present case, the interests of creditors and future creditors of the Company do not provide any reason not to terminate the winding up, given the circumstances in which it occurred and the indemnity given by Ms Marise Segelov. It appears that the only creditor of the Company is Randwick City Council and adequate arrangements have been made, by the terms of the Deed Poll and the deposit of funds in a solicitor's trust account, to discharge its debt on the Company's reinstatement and termination of the winding up. Mr Smith points out that the transfer of the property from the Company to Ms Marise Segelov would not give rise to a capital gains tax liability as the property is a pre-CGT asset; but, even if that were not the case, the terms of the indemnity given by Ms Marise Segelov under the Deed Poll are sufficient to address that matter, so far as the Company would be exposed to any liability, arising from the transaction. The issue which arises, in some matters, as to whether a company has sufficient financial strength to be returned "to the mainstream of commercial life" (to use the language of Sutherland versus Rahme Enterprises Pty Ltd (in liq) <case>; <case>), is of lesser weight where it appears that the proposed transaction will not have that effect, as distinct from discharging the debt owed to the Council and bringing about the transfer of the Property to Ms Marise Segelov. The interests of the liquidator do not cause any difficulty, because he consents both to the reinstatement of the Company and the termination of the winding up. The termination of the winding up is sought by the contributories and is plainly in their interests, and there is no public interest or matter of commercial morality that is inconsistent with a termination of the winding up. 
For these reasons, I was satisfied that this was an appropriate case to make an order that ASIC reinstate the registration of the Company and that the members' voluntary liquidation of the Company be terminated, immediately following that reinstatement. I made orders substantially in accordance with the Short Minutes of Order proposed by the Plaintiffs, as initialled by me and placed in the file.
