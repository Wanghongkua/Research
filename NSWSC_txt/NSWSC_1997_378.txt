Morris versus Welling & Ors /95 September 1997 
Graham A-J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: On 4 April 1994 a motor vehicle accident is said to have occurred on the Yeoval to Cumnock Road near Cumnock. The plaintiff and her three children were passengers in a car being driven by her husband and their father, the late Robert Leslie Morris, who died as a result of injuries sustained by him in the accident. The first defendant is said to have been the driver of the other car with which the plaintiff's car collided. The defendant's car was owned by the first and second defendants. Cabonne Shire Council, the third defendant/third cross-claimant is said to have been responsible for the state of the roadway at the place where the accident occurred. 
These proceedings have been brought by the plaintiff for the benefit of herself and her three children pursuant to the provisions of the [Compensation to Relatives Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctra1897288/).

Under [section (1)(c)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s5.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) any tort-feasor liable in respect of damage suffered by any person as a result of a tort may recover contribution from any other tort-feasor who would, if sued, have been liable in respect of the same damage, whether as a joint tort-feasor or otherwise.

Joint tort-feasors are those responsible for the same tort. For there to be joint tort-feasors, there must be a concurrence in the act or acts causing damage. Several tort-feasors, on the other hand, are those responsible only for the same damage (per Brennan C.J., Dawson and Toohey JJ in Thompson v.
Australian Capital Television Pty. Limited <case>; [(1996) 71 ALJR 131] at 132).

In the context of an action under the [Compensation to Relatives
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctra1897288/) can a successful claim "in respect of the same damage" be made against a deceased whose executrix has brought the action for the benefit of herself and her three children? This is the real question tendered for decision in the current application in this case.

Under [section (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctra1897288/s3.html) of the [Compensation to Relatives
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctra1897288/), any reasonable expenses of the funeral or the cremation of the deceased person and the reasonable cost of erecting a headstone or tombstone over the grave of the deceased person may be recovered and under [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctra1897288/s4.html) damages proportioned to the injury resulting from the death to the widow and children respectively for whom and for whose benefit the action is brought may be recovered and divided amongst such persons, subject to the prior deduction of costs not recovered from the defendant.

As I see it, there is no recognised cause of action under which an executrix could recover damages against the estate of her late husband for his own funeral expenses etc. nor is there any recognised cause of action under which a widow and her children could recover damages against the estate of their late husband and father for the injury resulting to them from his death for which the [Compensation to Relatives
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctra1897288/) provides.
In Horton v. Byrne [(1956) 30 ALJ 583] at 585 the High Court said:- "The general nature of the measure of damages under Lord Campbell's Act has often been stated. It is compensation for material loss. The compensation should represent the balance of the loss, reduced to terms of money, which the deceased's relatives incur in consequence of his death after deducting the pecuniary gains which on the other hand accrue to them from that event. The loss is usually a prospective one and all reasonable expectations of material advantage are to be taken into account." (See also section 5) 
In this case what the third defendant/third cross-claimant has sought to do in its Amended Third Cross-Claim filed 23 June 1997 is to claim contribution from the third cross-defendant Australian Associated Motor Insurers Limited (ACN 791 744) on the assumption that the deceased would, if sued by the plaintiff, have been liable in respect of the same damage as that to which the plaintiff may be held to be entitled under the [Compensation to Relatives
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctra1897288/). It relies on [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s54.html) of the [Motor Accidents Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) to found a claim for contribution against the deceased's insurer but for the claim to be made good, it must be capable of being made good against the deceased.

It is obvious that, in a case such as this, no action would lie against the deceased for the same damage as that which the plaintiff may recover against the defendants. The learned Master, whose decision of 23 July 1997 is the subject of this appeal, effectively so held in the last half page of his reasons for judgment.

As I see it, this is not a case where the question which I have posed above is so difficult that it ought not be decided summarily (see General Steel
Industries Inc. v. Commissioner for Railways  <case>; <case>; [(1972) 126 CLR 507] at 515).

In my opinion no relevant error has been revealed and the appeal should be dismissed.

Other questions have arisen as to the effect of [section (4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1965404/s10.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1965404/) and [sections ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s74.html) and of the [Motor Accidents
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/). None of these relevantly concern the third cross-defendant and it is unnecessary to address the effect of these provisions in this judgment.

In paragraph 16 of the Statement of Claim there is a claim for nervous shock brought by the plaintiff against each of the defendants. In representative proceedings under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctra1897288/s4.html) of the [Compensation to Relatives
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ctra1897288/), such a claim ought not to have been made. In any event, the plaintiff has already brought proceedings in the District Court of New South Wales for nervous shock against the third cross-defendant relying upon [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s54.html) of the [Motor Accidents
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) and these were settled on 3 September 1996. Under [section (1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/s5.html) of the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lrpa1946404/) she cannot recover under any judgment which she may now obtain any further moneys in excess of those which, I assume, have already been paid to her under the
District Court judgment.

If any claim for contribution is presently available in respect of the plaintiff's claim for nervous shock it is one which would be made by the third cross-defendant and not against it.

In all the circumstances the orders which I propose to make are that the appeal of the third defendant/third cross-claimant filed 19 August 1997 be dismissed and that the third defendant/third cross-claimant pay the third cross-defendant's costs of the appeal.
