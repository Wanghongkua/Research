Con TSEKOURAS versus Paul XENOS /96 
Monday 17 February 1997 
SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES COMMON LAW DIVISION 
HIDDEN J 
ORDER 
HIS HONOUR: In this matter there has been filed in court today a further amended summons. I dispense with service of that amended summons. It is much to the same effect as the summons already served on the defendant. The defendant has not appeared today, as indeed previously. 
I am satisfied that the requirement of notice of today's proceedings, imposed by Dowd J in December, has been met.

It is sufficient to say I am persuaded by the argument of Mr McQuillan that, in the circumstances of this case, the time limit for an application for an assessment of costs imposed by [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s199.html) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) and cl of the Regulations made thereunder does not apply.

Accordingly, I make an order in terms of paragraph 1 of the Further Amended
Summons filed in court today. I make declarations in terms of paragraphs 2 and .
 (Mr McQuillan applied for costs) 
I direct that the defendant pay the costs of this application.
