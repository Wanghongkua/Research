Monday, 8 February 2010  /279355 Andrew Hugh Jenner Wily as Liquidator of Business
Australia Capital Mortgage Pty Ltd & Business Australia Capital Finance
Pty Ltd versus Terra Cresta Business Solutions Pty Ltd 
JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: This is an application under [s 473(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s473.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) that the Court determine the remuneration of Mr Levi as liquidator of Terra Cresta Business Solutions Pty Ltd in the sum of $67,511.40 for the period from 5 August to 24 October 2008, and $30,701 for the period from 25 October 2008 to 15 May 2009.  The application is opposed by Mr Salmon. He claims to be a creditor in his capacity as trustee of the Salmon Family Trust. He also claims to be a creditor in his own right. He is presently bankrupt. His trustee in bankruptcy neither supports nor opposes the liquidator's application.
 Mr Salmon contended he had not been served with the material on which the liquidator relies, but there is evidence of those materials having been duly served by post.
 The liquidator's evidence is that there are insufficient funds to satisfy his claim for remuneration. It would not be just to postpone the determination of this application which would result in the liquidator incurring further expense, which would further deplete the moneys available to meet his claim for remuneration.
 At a meeting of creditors held on 24 December 2008 two creditors, including the Australian Taxation Office, indicated that they would vote in favour of a proposed resolution to approve the liquidator's remuneration. Two creditors, namely Mr Salmon and a Mr Lawson, indicated they would vote against such a resolution. As the liquidator could not give a casting vote the resolution was not put.
 Hence the application is made pursuant to [s (3)(b)(ii)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s473.html) that the Court determine the liquidator's remuneration for the periods in question.
 In support of that claim the liquidator has provided a detailed description of the work done during the periods in question and the hours spent by himself and different persons in his office.
 On 21 July 2009 Mr Lawson lodged a written objection to the liquidator's then claims for remuneration. He contended, in part, that the hours spent by the liquidator were grossly inflated. But the primary complaint was that the liquidator had spent time and money in challenging a charge pursuant to which
Mr Lawson claimed to be a secured creditor.
 I see nothing in that complaint to warrant the rejection or reduction of the liquidator's claim.
 Mr Salmon made wide-ranging, but unparticularised, allegations that the liquidator had a conflict of interest, which he had hidden from the Court, and had acted fraudulently and corruptly. If there is substance to those allegations they would presumably warrant an enquiry pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s536.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), or perhaps [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s423.html)
If on such inquiry the allegations were made good the Court, pursuant to [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s536.html), could take such action as it thought fit.
 No proceedings have been commenced either by Mr Salmon or by ASIC pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s536.html) for such an inquiry into the liquidator's alleged misfeasance.  On 1 December 2009 Austin J refused an application by Mr Salmon for an order referring him for pro bono legal assistance in relation to the proposed investigation of the actions of the liquidator, among others, pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s536.html) or [s 423](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s423.html) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/).
 On an application under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s473.html) for the determination or review of a liquidator's remuneration, the Court is required by [s (10)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s473.html) to have regard to whether the remuneration is reasonable, taking into account the matters listed in that subsection. Whilst the listed matters includes "any other relevant matter", none of the specific matters to which the Court is required to have regard encompasses allegations of the kind Mr Salmon adumbrates as being reasons for rejecting the liquidator's claim for remuneration.
 It seems to me that [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s473.html) is an inappropriate vehicle for determining the kind of allegations that Mr
Salmon seeks to raise.
 If on an inquiry under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s536.html) the complaints that Mr Salmon makes were substantiated, and the Court was satisfied that by reason of misconduct the liquidator should not have received remuneration, the power under [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s536.html) for the Court to take such action as it thinks fit would be amply wide enough to require repayment of any remuneration which it might be found on such an inquiry the liquidator should not have received.
 It is not possible on the present materials to say that there is any ground for denying the liquidator his remuneration. Indeed, in his reasons for judgment of 16 November 2009 in related proceedings no. 4200 of 2006, Austin J was moved to describe an affidavit of Mr Salmon in those proceedings as being a document which made scattered allegations against various people to do with blackmail, fraud, perjury, threats of intimidation, attempted bribery and so on, without any documentary support for the statements made.
 Having regard to the liquidator's description of the work done and the amount of time spent in carrying out that work, I am satisfied that the claim for remuneration is reasonable.
 For these reasons, I make orders 1, 2 and 3 in the interlocutory process filed on 25 November 2009.
