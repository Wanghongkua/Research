JUDGMENT:  
IN THE SUPREME COURT 
OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
EQUITY DIVISION 
CORPORATIONS LIST  
BARRETT J  
THURSDAY 20 OCTOBER 2005  /05 SIMS GROUP LIMITED  
JUDGMENT  The plaintiff seeks an order under s.411(4)(b) of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) 2001 approving a scheme arrangement between the plaintiff and its members.
The evidence shows that the proposed arrangement was placed before members at a meeting and that that meeting was, subject to one matter to which I shall refer presently, convened in accordance with the orders made by the court on 2
August 2005.  Documents were dispatched to members in accordance with the court's orders.
At the meeting, the arrangement was approved by an overwhelming majority in terms of both the number of members and the number of votes. To be more specific, 97.81 per cent of members present in person or by proxy voted in favour of the arrangement and the number of votes in favour represented 99.34 per cent of the total votes cast.  A letter from ASIC dated 19 October 2005 states that ASIC has no objection to the scheme and is satisfied that the scheme has not been proposed for the purpose of enabling any person to avoid the operation of any of the provisions of Chapter 6 of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). In terms of [s.411(17)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s411.html), therefore, the matter of circumvention of Chapter 6 is not one with which the court need concern itself.  No member has appeared on the hearing of this application. Nor were the plaintiff's solicitors informed that any member proposed to appear. The application is accordingly unopposed.  There is, however, one matter requiring comment. It concerns the convening of the meeting of members. The orders made by the court on 2 August 2005 included, as order 7, an order that the scheme meeting be advertised once in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper by means of an advertisement in the form annexed to the order, with the advertisement being published not less than 14 days before the date of the meeting. In the events that have happened, that order has not been complied with.  The affidavit of Ms O'Brien of Baker & McKenzie makes it clear that the non-compliance was inadvertent. The matter of advertising was simply overlooked. The evidence also makes it clear that documents were sent by post to all members at their registered addresses shown in the register of members and that only 118 letters were returned unclaimed out of a total of some ,000. Furthermore, had all the members whose letters were returned attended the meeting and voted against the proposal, there would have been no more than a miniscule difference in the number of members and the number of votes favouring the proposal. It cannot be suggested that anyone suffered prejudice by reason of the lack of compliance with order 7.  There is no requirement in the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), the
Corporations Regulations 2001 (Cth) or the [Supreme Court (Corporations)
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/) 1999 for the advertising of a meeting of this kind in the way that was directed by order 7. The court did not make order 7 for any particular reason or to guard against any particular eventuality brought to its notice. It made the order because it formed part of the system of member notification the plaintiff itself proposed.  With the law as it now stands, there is a question whether there is any real utility in an order requiring the advertising in a newspaper of a scheme meeting, where the scheme is a scheme between a company and its members. Since the introduction of [Part
G.2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/index.html#p2g.2) of the Corporations Law by the Company Law Review Act 1998 (Cth), there have existed detailed statutory provisions about the calling of meetings of members of companies. Division 3 of Part 2G.2 is headed "How to call meetings of members". It deals with the convening of a "meeting of a company's members". Section 249J sets out comprehensive requirements for the giving of notice which, so far as posting is concerned, recognise as the appropriate address that appearing in respect of a member in the register of members.
There is also recognition that notice may be given personally or, if the member so wishes, by fax or email. It is also permissible to give notice by any other means the company's constitution allows. These provisions obviously apply to a "meeting of a company's members" convened under and for the purposes of Part 5.1: so much was explicitly recognised by Santow J at paragraph (4) of Appendix B to his judgment in Re NRMA Ltd <case>; [(2000) 33 ACSR 595] at p.649.  Rule 3.3(2) of the [Supreme Court (Corporations)
Rules](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/) requires that a meeting of members ordered under s.411 be convened, held and conducted in accordance with the provisions of [Part
G.2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/index.html#p2g.2) that apply to the members of a company and such provisions of the company's constitution applying to meetings of members as are not inconsistent with [Part
G.2.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/index.html#p2g.2)
There is thus a consolidation of the role of [Part
G.2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/index.html#p2g.2) in relation to [Part .1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/index.html#p5.1) meetings of members. [Rule .3(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/scr1999383/s3.3.html) begins with the words, "Unless the Court otherwise orders", thus making it clear that the court may fashion a special regime for a special case - although the court could not override any of the express provisions of the [Corporations
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/).  The legislation thus seems to me to deal in a comprehensive way with the matter of the convening of [Part .1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.1) meetings of members, including the matter of giving notice to members. In those circumstances, I would not expect that it would be appropriate for an order such as order 7 to be made as a routine matter although, of course, particular circumstances in a particular case may indicate a need for such an order. That is something that could and should be addressed if and when the particular need is perceived. Otherwise, as it seems to me, the legislation sufficiently takes care of matters and an order in the form of order 7 is not required. A scheme meeting of members does not, of its nature, differ from any other meeting of members so far as the matter of giving notice to members is concerned. [Part .1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/index.html#p5.1) meetings of creditors obviously stand in an entirely different light.  In the particular case before me, the failure to comply with order 7 has not had any effect that should cause the court to pause in the slightest in making its decision to approve the scheme.  A case for the grant of approval has been shown. I make the orders in the short minutes of order which I initial and date. The confidential Exhibit FMM tendered on 2 August 2005 is returned to the plaintiff.
