JUDGMENT
HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal from a determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal made with respect to the plaintiff. The plaintiff appealed from the whole of a decision of the Tribunal and sought an order that a community treatment order made by the Tribunal on 24 February 2012 be set aside. 
According to the record of the Tribunal entitled "Determination of Tribunal", on that day, the Tribunal made a determination under [s 35](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mha2007128/s35.html) of the [Mental Health Act 2007](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mha2007128/) that the plaintiff is a mentally ill person and the Tribunal made a community treatment order requiring him to accept treatment and/or medication as prescribed by the Director of Community Treatment of the Croydon Community Mental Health Facility, or her delegate. 
The plaintiff denies that he is mentally ill and also complains that the medication he says he is required to take, is medication to which he is allergic and which has serious side effects. 
The application for the community treatment order was made by the Director of Clinical Services, Concord Centre for Mental Health.
[Section 51(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mha2007128/s51.html) of the [Mental Health Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mha2007128/) provides that a community treatment order may be made in a number of circumstances, including following a mental health inquiry. Under subs 53(4), the Tribunal may not make a community treatment order at a mental health inquiry unless it is of the opinion that the person is a mentally ill person. A mental health inquiry is an inquiry under Div 3 of [Pt 2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mha2007128/index.html#p2) of Ch 3 of the Act. Such an inquiry is held in relation to a person who is detained in a mental health facility (see [ss 27(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mha2007128/s27.html) and [34](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mha2007128/s34.html)) as the plaintiff was. [Section 35](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mha2007128/s35.html) prescribes matters to be done and to be considered in the conduct of a mental health inquiry. These include taking steps as provided for in [s 35(2A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mha2007128/s35.html) and (2B).
[Section 150](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mha2007128/s150.html) of the [Mental Health Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/mha2007128/) provides: "150 Composition of Tribunal 
The Tribunal is to be constituted by one or more members nominated by the
President for the exercise of its functions.

For the purpose of exercising any of its functions (other than in relation to mental health inquiries or under the [Mental Health (Forensic

[Regulation 21](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/mhr2007219/s21.html) of the [Mental Health Regulation 2007](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/mhr2007219/) provides: "21 [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) of
Tribunal for certain proceedings 
The Tribunal must be constituted by 3 persons for the purposes of exercising the following functions: a review of a voluntary patient under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s9.html) of the
Act, a review of an involuntary patient under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s37.html) of the Act, determining an appeal under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s44.html) of the Act, determining an application for a community treatment order or for the variation or revocation of a community treatment order (other than an application for variation or revocation that is not contested), a review under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s63.html) of the Act of a detained person, determining an appeal by an affected person under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s67.html) of the Act, conducting an ECT inquiry within the meaning of Division 3 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/index.html#p2) of Chapter 4 of the Act, determining an application for consent to the performance of a surgical operation on an involuntary patient under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s101.html) of the Act, determining an application for consent to the carrying out of special medical treatment on an involuntary patient under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s103.html) of the Act.

The Tribunal must be constituted by the President or a Deputy President for the purpose of exercising the function of determining whether to grant an approval to the making of an application for a change of name of a forensic patient as a supervising authority under Division 3 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/bdamra1995383/index.html#p5) of the [Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/bdamra1995383/)."
Pursuant to reg 21(1)(d), the application for a community treatment order in respect of the plaintiff was required to be determined by a Tribunal constituted by three persons. The Tribunal that dealt with the application in this case was not so constituted. It was constituted only by a lawyer, Ms Tracey Sheedy. As the Tribunal was not properly constituted, the community treatment order of 24 February 2012 should be quashed. 
Although the written record provided by the Tribunal of its determination stated that the Tribunal had made a determination in a mental health inquiry under [s 35](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/bdamra1995383/s35.html) of the Act, it is clear from the transcript of the proceedings before the Tribunal that it did not conduct such an inquiry.
The proceeding before the Tribunal opened with the member stating that she had been asked to make a 12-month community treatment order by the hospital. She then outlined the procedure that would be undertaken during the course of the hearing. Evidence was taken and submissions were received. At page 24 of the transcript, the member gave reasons for making a community treatment order. She commenced those reasons by stating that "This is an application for a twelve month community treatment order for [the plaintiff]". Nothing was said about conducting a mental health inquiry under [s 35.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/bdamra1995383/s35.html) Nothing was done to comply with [s 35(2A)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/bdamra1995383/s35.html) or (2B). 
There is no dispute that there was a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction under that section. 
The second defendant is the Sydney Local Health District. It was not represented at the hearing before the Tribunal. It has very properly identified the difficulties with the procedures adopted by the Tribunal. I understand it was the second defendant that pointed out that the Tribunal was not properly constituted to deal with the application for the community treatment order. 
It may well be that, notwithstanding the defects in the procedures before the Tribunal, I could proceed with the appeal under [ss 67](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/bdamra1995383/s67.html) and 163. Appeals to the Court are appeals de novo (s 164). The second defendant says that the jurisdictional failures by the Tribunal could be cured by the hearing of such an appeal. Whether that is so or not, that is not the appropriate course in this case. Both parties are entitled to a hearing before a properly constituted Tribunal for the community treatment order. On the hearing of that application before three members, it would be expected that at least one of the members would be a psychiatrist. If the appeal proceeded de novo on its merits and were allowed, it would still be open to the second defendant to make a further application for a community treatment order to the Tribunal. 
It is appropriate that the determination of whether the plaintiff is mentally ill and, if so, what form, if any, a community treatment order should be made, be determined by a properly constituted Tribunal. That is Parliament's expectation; it established a specialist Tribunal to deal with those questions. 
Moreover, there may be an issue on appeal as to the width of the orders the Court could make. There may be an issue as to whether the court could vary a community treatment order. I express no view on that question, but it is desirable that the matter be heard properly by the Tribunal before there is any appeal to this Court. 
For these reasons and subject to hearing from counsel as to the precise form of the order, the orders I propose are that the determination and orders made on 24 February 2012 by the Mental Health Review Tribunal constituted by Ms Tracey Sheedy concerning the plaintiff be quashed.
Secondly, that the Mental Health Review Tribunal determine the application for a community treatment order brought by the Director General of Clinical Services, the Concord Centre for Mental Health, in respect of the plaintiff, according to law, and that the Tribunal be constituted by three members.
I am conscious that such prerogative relief was not sought in the summons. Nonetheless, it appears to me that prerogative relief is what is appropriate in the circumstances.
The plaintiff has asked for his costs of the application. 
Rule 42.1 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules provides that if the Court makes any order as to costs, it is to order that costs follow the event, unless it appears to the Court that some other order should be made as to the whole or any part of the costs. 
As in other areas, particular principles may apply in protective matters. In Re J (No. 2) [[2011] NSWSC 1224], I said: "[118] In this case, the plaintiff has been successful and seeks costs. This matter is heard in the Protective List. Different principles apply in relation to protective matters. This has been recognised in authorities (see, for example, M versus K (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Powell J, 24 April 1989 unreported).; Application of O'Hara; Re M  <case>; and FA versus the Protective Commissioner <case> [119] It would be disturbing if persons were dissuaded from applying for relief under protective legislation for fear of incurring an adverse costs order. It would also be against the public interest if the defendant to an application were dissuaded from providing a proper response to what it genuinely considered to be the best interests of the plaintiff for fear of an adverse costs order. The bodies charged with responsibility for making what are very often difficult decisions that impact severely on people's lives have no option but to decide how they will exercise their statutory powers."
In the present case, the second defendant has acted entirely appropriately. It is not its fault that the proceedings before the Tribunal miscarried.
The plaintiff was initially self-represented. On the hearing before me today, he is represented by counsel, who informs me he appears pro bono. 
The plaintiff says that he has incurred some expenses and I understand that a psychiatrist's report has been obtained for him and that has come at some cost. On the other hand, that report will be available to be used in the further hearing before the Tribunal. 
The plaintiff also refers to other difficulties that he has faced as a result of a number of applications being made to the Tribunal and as a result of his having been involuntarily detained on a number of occasions. He says that, as a result, his life has been severely disrupted and he has been unable to earn an income. 
However, these last matters are not relevant to the question of what costs order should be made. Even if an order were made that the second defendant pay the plaintiff's costs, that would not compensate him for stress, nor for any income foregone, or matters of that kind. A costs order would only cover the expenses he has incurred in the course of the litigation in this Court. 
In my view, as it is shown that the second defendant has acted entirely reasonably and properly in this litigation and having regard to the matters of policy to which I referred in Re J (No. 2), it is not appropriate to make any order for costs and I decline to make such an order. 
I will hear the parties on the form of the orders that are proposed. [Counsel addressed.]
I make the following orders: 
Order that the determination and orders made on 24 February 2012 by the
Mental Health Review Tribunal constituted by Miss Tracey Sheedy concerning the plaintiff be quashed.
Order that the Mental Health Review Tribunal determine the application for a community treatment order brought by the Director General of Clinical
Services, Concord Centre for Mental Health, in respect of the plaintiff according to law and be constituted by three members.
Order that the summons be otherwise dismissed with no order as to costs.
Exhibit A to Miss Rowley's affidavit can be returned.
