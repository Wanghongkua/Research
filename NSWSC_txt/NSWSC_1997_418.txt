 ----- /95 - REGINA versus Brennan Patrick DONNELLY 
JUDGMENT (re admissibility of admissions) 
HIS HONOUR: Brennan Patrick Donnelly is charged with the murder of his wife,
Mary Donnelly, at their flat at Blacktown between 17 and 23 October 1994. He has elected for trial without a jury and the Crown has consented to that course. At the outset of the trial, I received evidence on the voir dire (s [Evidence Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/)) to determine the admissibility of admissions said to have been made by the accused to his cousin, who is a police officer, and to detectives in an electronically recorded interview.

Although the indictment specifies a range of dates, the Crown alleges that the killing occurred on Tuesday, 18 October 1994. For reasons which will appear, the deceased's body was not found until Sunday, 23 October. The accused and the deceased had been heroin users and, at the relevant time, both of them were on methadone and subject to supervision by the Probation and Parole
Service. Their probation officer, Ms Frances Sanders, visited them at their home on the Tuesday and, of the Crown witnesses, she is the last to have seen the deceased alive. She observed her to be angry, expressing dissatisfaction with the marriage, blaming the accused for introducing her to illicit drugs and saying that she was sick of methadone. Ms Sanders advised her to stay on methadone and to avoid using pills (as she had previously told Ms Sanders that she had been using serepax and rohypnol).

The evidence of what happened after Ms Sanders left on the Tuesday, and over the ensuing days, emanates almost entirely from the accused's admissions, which are the centrepiece of the Crown case. According to those admissions, there was a heated argument during which the deceased expressed dissatisfaction with their lifestyle and he remonstrated with her about her use of tablets. The deceased took some serepax. The argument continued. At some stage she said that she was going to hang herself and he threw his tie to her and invited her to do just that. She threw an ashtray at him, which he picked up and threw back at her. He placed the tie around her neck and pulled it tightly. As he put it to his cousin, he "started choking her". He added, "I couldn't stop, by the time I stopped it was too late, I don't know what happened, it wasn't me." He found that she had stopped breathing and he tried, unsuccessfully, to resuscitate her.

He carried her to a bed and lay next to her for a long time. He told police that he wanted her "to wake up", "to breathe". He said that he could not understand what had happened and that, once he realised that she was not "coming back", his only thought was to punish himself.

For much of the time until Sunday 23 October he remained in the flat with her.
On the Wednesday he pawned some property to raise money with which he bought some heroin. He returned home and took the heroin, hoping that it would be a fatal overdose. He then decided to shoot himself and tried to obtain a pistol, without success. On the Thursday he took a number of serepax tablets and consumed a large quantity of beer, hoping that he would not wake up. On the
Friday he picked up his methadone and, upon returning home, took it, again with beer, hoping for the same effect.

That having failed, he decided that the only way to kill himself was to cut his wrists, sit in the bath and bleed to death. The effect of what he told police is that, throughout the Saturday, he cut his wrists on several occasions, cutting deeper each time. At one stage he sat next to the deceased and, as he put it, "I prayed to God to take her soul and to take mine with it.
I asked His forgiveness for what I'd done .... ". On the last occasion that he cut his wrists he was in the bath, and it was there that he woke on the Sunday morning. He realised that he needed help and felt that he had to confide in someone. He dressed, wrapped his wrists in teatowels and had a neighbour drive him to Blacktown Hospital.

The foregoing is a very brief summary of what the accused told his cousin, Det
Const Scott Fischer, at the hospital that Sunday and what he told Det Snr
Const Delandre and Det Sgt Campbell in the course of an audio/videotaped interview at Blacktown Police Station on the following day, Monday 24 October.

Upon his admission to the hospital, the accused had staff contact his cousin, who arrived and spoke to him a little before midday on the Sunday. According to Det Fischer, he asked the accused what had happened and the accused began to cry, saying, "Sorry cuz, I fucked up big." Det Fischer said, "Don't worry it will be alright, we can sort this out." The accused said, "No, I killed her." Det Fischer said, "Who?" The accused said, "Mary". Det Fischer then explained that he would have to approach the matter as a police officer and that he would record anything further that was said, and he cautioned the accused. The accused said, "Yeah, I know but you're the only person that I can talk to. I didn't know what else to do." Det Fischer then obtained pen and paper and again cautioned the accused. The accused said, "Yeah, I know that but I've got to tell you." Det Fischer asked him what had happened and the accused then gave a relatively brief but adequate account of events from the
Tuesday until the Sunday.

Blacktown detectives were notified and the accused was placed under police guard at the hospital. It was in the early evening of the Monday that he was interviewed by detectives at Blacktown police station, in the course of which he gave a more detailed account of relevant events to the same effect as that given to his cousin.

The accused underwent surgery under general anaesthetic on the Sunday. The hospital notes record that a psychiatric assessment was recommended but, in fact, there was none. When he spoke to him, Det Fischer observed the accused to be confused, scared and very upset. On at least two occasions the accused embraced him and he was crying and shaking. An Occurrence Report prepared by
Det Sgt Campbell on 23 October noted that a police guard had been arranged following the accused's surgery and that he was still considered to be suicidal.

On the Monday a police officer assigned to guard the accused from 7.00 am to .30 pm, Snr Const Stever, observed him to be "groggy" and generally very quiet, although he complained of pain and discomfort as a result of his injuries. That afternoon the deceased's brother, Ramiz Saqqa, came to the hospital room with a companion and demanded to be allowed to speak to the accused. At the time Const Maund was in the room and Snr Const Stever was nearby. Const Maund sought to prevent Mr Saqqa from approaching the accused and a struggle ensued, involving both men and both police officers. In the course of the struggle Mr Saqqa shouted, "Why did you do it? It's my sister, mate. She never did nothin' to you. Why did you do it?" As Snr Const Stever seized Mr Saqqa's companion, that man said, "He killed my mate's sister."
After the two men were subdued Mr Saqqa was searched and a knife was found tucked into one of his socks.

Fears for the accused's safety as a result of this incident led to his being discharged prematurely on the Monday afternoon, when he was taken to Blacktown police station to be interviewed. The evidence discloses that the detectives made enquires of the medical staff about the accused's physical health and were told that there was a danger of infection which, if it eventuated, could be treated at the prison hospital at Long Bay. It does not seem that any enquiry was made about his psychiatric condition. At Blacktown police station the detectives observed him to be frightened and, at times, tearful. His brother, Jason Donnelly, saw him at the police station before the interview.
He described him as "shaky, scared and just in a very incoherent state". By "incoherent" he meant that, while he could understand what the accused was saying, the accused did not appear to be able to understand what was being said to him. Jason Donnelly contacted a Legal Aid solicitor on a mobile phone who advised the accused to have nothing to say. Clearly, the accused did not follow that advice.

Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist, saw the accused for the purpose of the trial (but not, of course, at the time he was interviewed by police). The doctor had access to the videotape of the interview at Blacktown police station, other material in the Crown case including the statement of Det Const
Fischer, and the records of Blacktown Hospital relating to the accused's treatment there. The doctor had regard to the accused's account of the events of the Tuesday till the Sunday, particularly the suicide attempts, and he was satisfied from an examination of the medical records that the accused's slashing his wrists was a serious attempt on his life. He was of the view that the accused was severely depressed at the time he spoke to the police. That depression would have led to a disturbed mental state which would have been exacerbated by the drugs administered to him whilst in hospital and at the time of his discharge on the Monday afternoon, as well as the incident involving the deceased's brother. He said that depression may affect a person's ability to think in a balanced and rational way, and that the accused's ability to decide whether or not to speak to the police may have been impaired. Further, he said that depressed people may say one thing whilst thinking another, and that it was possible that the accused's confession was false.

Dr Westmore said that, in the videotaped interview, it did not appear that the accused's cognitive functioning was impaired, but his demeanour was consistent with depression. As he put it, "What we saw was a subdued, despondent man who was more likely than not depressed significantly." He acknowledged in cross examination, that people who had been responsible for the death of a loved one may well feel depressed and have a strong urge to confess to what they had done. Nevertheless, he said that in the accused's case he would have recommended that he be given the opportunity to have psychiatric treatment before being interviewed.

There is no doubt that, on the face of it, the circumstances in which the accused made admissions on the Sunday and the Monday were inauspicious. For the purpose of my decision on the voir dire, I accept that the accused had spent most of several days in the company of his deceased wife in their flat; that he had attempted suicide several times; that at all relevant times he was significantly depressed; that he was in pain and, certainly by the Monday, affected to some extent by the drugs which had been administered to him; that he had been discharged from Blacktown Hospital earlier than the medical staff would have wished; and that he interpreted the incident on the Monday afternoon involving the deceased's brother as an attempt upon his life. These findings are available to me on the whole of the material presented on the voir dire, even though the accused himself did not give evidence. I accept without reservation the evidence of Dr Westmore: in particular what he had to say about the possible effect upon the accused's mental state of his severe depression.
 [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), [s 85.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s85.html) 
Mrs Nash of counsel, who appears with Mr Whitelaw for the accused, argued, firstly, that the evidence is inadmissible by virtue of [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s85.html) of the [Evidence Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s85.html) provides: "(1) This section applies only in a criminal proceeding and only to evidence of an admission made by a defendant: in the course of official questioning; or as a result of an act of another person who is capable of influencing the decision whether a prosectuion of the defendant should be brought or should be continued.

Evidence of the admission is not admissible unless the circumstances in which the admission was made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected.

Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of subsection (2), it is to take into account: any relevant condition or characteristic of the person who made the admission, including age, personality and education and any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which the person is or appears to be subject; and if the admission was made in response to questioning: the nature of the questions and the manner in which they were put; and the nature of any threat, promise or other inducement made to the person questioned." 
She submitted that the section was applicable because the whole of the challenged evidence was of admissions made in the course of "official questioning", within the meaning of [s (1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s85.html)
The term "official questioning" is defined in the dictionary as "questioning by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission, or possible commission, of an offence". "Investigating official" is also defined in such a way as to include any police officer.

It is common ground that the recorded interview at Blacktown police station amounted to official questioning in the relevant sense. The Crown prosecutor submitted, however, that the conversation between Det Const Fischer and the accused at the hospital on the Sunday did not. As to the initial conversation, before Det Fischer cautioned the accused, I think that submission is sound.
Clearly, Det Fischer attended the hospital as a relative, not a police officer, and the accused's admission that he had killed his wife was not responsive to anything the detective had said and, no doubt, came as a complete surprise to him. Understandably, the accused's assertion that he had "fucked up big" would have been interpreted by Det Fischer as a reference to his suicide attempt, not the death of his wife.

However, the Crown prosecutor submitted that the account the accused then gave, after having been cautioned by Det Fischer, still did not fall within [s (1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s85.html)
He argued that Det Fischer was still approaching the matter as a relative, and was simply giving the accused the opportunity to explain his admission that he had killed his wife. He argued also that the accused's account could not be said to have been given in the course of questioning: in effect, it was a monologue in response to a general enquiry about what had happened. I am not persuaded by either of these submissions. At that point, Det Fischer was acting in his official capacity (and had said as much to the accused). Being a police officer, he was an "investigating official" in the relevant sense, even though he was not then assigned to investigate the crime with which the accused is now charged. The fact is that he was making enquires about the possible commission of an offence of which he had just become aware. What ensued was not deprived of the character of official questioning merely because the accused chose to provide a lengthy answer to one question.

Accordingly, the greater part of the admissions said to have been made to Det
Fischer fall within [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s85.html) That being so, the Crown prosecutor accepted that they were not admissible unless he could prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the circumstances in which they were made were such as to make it unlikely that their truth was adversely affected: sub-s (2).

The voir dire is now governed by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s189.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), dealing with the procedure where the decision whether evidence should be admitted depends upon findings of fact: what the section refers to as "a preliminary question". Sub-section (3) of that section provides: "(3) In the hearing of a preliminary question about whether a defendant's admission should be admitted into evidence (whether in the exercise of a discretion or not) in a criminal proceeding, the issue of the admission's truth or untruth is to be disregarded unless the issue is introduced by the defendant." 
Mrs Nash submitted that, in the light of this sub-section, the enquiry under [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s85.html), whether the circumstances in which an admission was made were such as might have adversely affected its truth, should have no regard to the apparent reliability of the admission under consideration. The enquiry should centre upon the surrounding circumstances, with a view to determining whether they might have affected adversely the truth of any admission which might have been made (whatever the terms of that admission might have been). Accordingly, she argued, I should have regard only to the accused's mental and physical state as evidenced by his own actions, the observations of him by various witnesses, the medical evidence and, in particular, the evidence of Dr Westmore, but I should make no attempt to assess, even in a preliminary way, the reliability of the account given by the accused to his cousin and to the detectives in the recorded interview.

It should be noted that [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s189.html) requires the truth or untruth of an admission to be disregarded "unless the issue is introduced by the defendant." As the Crown prosecutor pointed out,
Mrs Nash did raise the question of the truth of the admissions on the voir dire in a manner which I shall explain shortly. That is sufficient to dispose of this submission, but it is appropriate that it be given proper consideration.

Since the matter was argued before me, the Court of Criminal Appeal handed down its decision in R versus Garry James Rooke (unreported, 2 September 1997).
Barr J gave the leading judgment, in the course of which (at pp 14-16) there is a useful examination of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s85.html), including a reference to its relationship to [s (3).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s189.html)
That was a case in which certain admissions were alleged to have been fabricated by the police, and the court held that that was a matter to be determined by the jury, not by the trial judge when considering whether the evidence ought be admitted. The effect of Barr J's reasoning is that, for the purpose of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s85.html), a judge assumes that the admission was made, but examines whether its reliability might have been affected by the circumstances in which it was made. As his Honour put it (at p 15): "... the section may be said to be intended to require courts to inquire, where appropriate, into the process by which official questioning produces evidence tendered at trial. If the circumstances of the official questioning are such as to produce untruthful or unreliable evidence of admissions - adversely to affect their truth - the evidence is inadmissible. But the section is only concerned with the truth or reliability of evidence of admissions in this limited way. It has generally no part to play in the admissibility of evidence of admissions which may be untrue or unreliable for other reasons. Untruthfulness or unreliability in those circumstances is not a question for the trial judge at all, but for the jury. The authors of ALRC 26 said, at para 765, speaking of the draft forerunner to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s85.html), `the trial judge should determine as a preliminary issue whether the reliability of the admission may have been impaired by the way it was obtained' (emphasis added). This construction is consistent with sub-s 189(3) ..." 
In Rooke the court did not deal with the precise issue which arises here.
Nevertheless, inherent in the reasoning of Barr J is a distinction between an examination of the reliability of a confession for the purpose of determining its admissibility, on the one hand, and the question whether it was made and, if so, the weight to be given to it in proof of guilt, on the other. The intention of [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s189.html) is that, on the voir dire, the latter question should not generally intrude into the examination of the former. However, the sub-section envisages that there may be cases in which it is legitimate for an accused to seek to prove that the confession (assuming it to have been made) is untrue. Obviously, where such an issue is raised, the Crown is then entitled to adduce evidence in support of its truth.

I am satisfied that, for the purposes of [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s85.html), regard may be had to the reliability of the confession to which objection has been taken in determining its admissibility. In other words, in examining whether the circumstances in which a confession was made were such as to make it unlikely that its truth was adversely affected, the terms of the confession itself are not to be ignored. There may be thought to be some artificiality in this process where the trial is by judge alone, and the judge who examines the reliability of a confession for the purpose of determining its admissibility must, if it is admitted, also assess its weight in proof of guilt. In fact, no difficulty arises. Any view I might form at this stage of the reliability of this accused's admissions could be no more than preliminary, and would in no sense conclude the issue of their truth or untruth (to use the language of [s (3)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s189.html)
Upon their being admitted into evidence, I would approach the assessment of the probative force of the admissions with an open mind, having regard to the whole of the evidence in the trial.

Although the events described by the accused are bizarre, his account of them is lucid. In the recorded interview his answers are responsive to the questions asked and sometimes quite detailed. I agree with Dr Westmore that his appearance is despondent, which is hardly surprising in the light of his depression and the circumstances giving rise to it. I am mindful of Dr
Westmore's evidence that the accused's depressed state could have impaired his ability to decide whether or not to speak to the police. However, he was cautioned by Det Const Fischer at the hospital, as he was by Det Snr Const
Delandre at the outset of the recorded interview (question 2), and on two further occasions in the course of it when matters were raised which might have disclosed other criminality (questions 67 and 126). On each occasion he indicated that he understood the caution.

Undoubtedly, it would have been preferable for the police to have arranged a psychiatric assessment of the accused before interviewing him, although it must be said that the opportunity to do so was not explored in evidence. At one stage during the recorded interview he was asked about his health and current medication, with a view to determining that he was fit to be interviewed (questions 102-110). At a later stage, he was asked whether he felt "alright to continue", and he said that he was (question 189). Towards the end of the interview, Det Delandre enquired whether he still had suicidal thoughts and had him put on record his feelings as a result of the incident involving the deceased's brother. Asked how he felt at that stage, the accused said, "numb, empty, confused", but agreed that he still knew what was going on in the course of the interview (questions 242-8). Asked (question 32) about his admissions the previous day to his cousin, the accused said, "... when I spoke to Scott I knew what I was saying." 
There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that any of the police applied pressure of any kind upon the accused to make admissions. Indeed, in the recorded interview he presents as a truly remorseful man, bent upon unburdening his soul.

On the question of the reliability of the admissions, Mrs Nash tendered the post mortem report of Dr Peter Ellis, forensic pathologist, together with part of the transcript of his evidence in the committal proceedings. The Crown prosecutor tendered the report of Dr Judith Perl, pharmacologist, in response to which Mrs Nash tendered the report of Dr Max Willow, medical practitioner and pharmacologist. For present purposes, the effect of the opinions of these experts may be stated briefly.

Dr Ellis performed a post mortem examination of the deceased in the morning of
Monday 24 October, but could reach no conclusion about the cause of death due to what he described as the moderate decomposition of the body. He observed marks on her neck which could have been the result of strangulation, but which might have been artefactual changes produced by the decomposition process. He did not observe common signs of strangulation, such as pin-point haemorrhages or damage to the structures of the neck, although he was not prepared to say that they would be found in every case and, in any event, was unsure to what extent they might have been masked by decomposition.

Analysis of post mortem samples taken from the deceased revealed quantities of methadone and oxazepam in her blood, liver and stomach. Serepax contains oxazepam, a drug of the benzodiazepine class. In her report, Dr Perl expressed the view that the concentrations of these drugs, even in combination, would not have killed the deceased, particularly in the light of her participation in a methadone programme and the tolerance to that drug which she would have developed. On the other hand Dr Willow, also allowing for tolerance, concluded that the drug concentration, especially the methadone, could have caused her death.

Mrs Nash also tendered Blacktown Hospital records relating to an admission by the deceased on 11 October 1994, following an assault when she sustained a blow to the head. She complained of headache and "faintness, weakness and nausea". She discharged herself from the hospital prematurely, against medical advice. Also in evidence was a statement of Mrs Aida Saqqa, the mother of the deceased, from which it appears that the last time she saw the deceased was 14
October. The deceased told Mrs Saqqa of the assault and appeared to Mrs Saqqa to be "very ill". Dr Willow reported that the probability of death from the drugs found in the deceased's body may have been increased in the event of certain "underlying pathological conditions". Those conditions are described in the body of the report, but the evidence does not enable me to determine whether the deceased was suffering from any of them at the relevant time.

This scientific evidence could be of considerable significance in the trial.
Exactly what use might be made of it by the defence I cannot say at this stage. As observed, the accused did not give evidence on the voir dire. There is a hint in the evidence of Dr Westmore that the accused told him that his admissions were untrue. Certainly, the evidence raises a possibility that the accused did not kill his wife, although he may have believed that he did. On either basis, the evidence raises an issue properly to be ventilated in the course of the trial, but it does not persuade me that the evidence of the admissions should be rejected.

I should record that I admitted on the voir dire records of the Corrections
Health Service containing notes of consultations with the accused over a period when he was in custody following his arrest. For the most part the authorship of the notes is unclear, but they appear to be made by registered nurses. The Crown prosecutor placed significance upon the fact that, in consultations of 25 October, 26 October and 17 November 1994, it appears that the accused continued to acknowledge that he had killed his wife. However, it seems that in the course of consultations on 14 December 1994 and 9 May 1995 he had resiled from that position, and was claiming that the deceased had suicided. Dr Westmore was shown these notes whilst giving evidence and from them he concluded that, during the earlier consultations, the accused was still depressed and in a disturbed frame of mind. In all the circumstances, I do not consider that the notes are entitled to any significant weight in determining the issue on the voir dire and, although I admitted them into evidence, I have not had regard to them.

I have given the evidence anxious consideration, taking into account the matters set out in [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s85.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). I am mindful of Dr Westmore's evidence that the accused's depression could have led him to make a false confession. Dr Westmore expressed this as a possibility and did not attempt to assess its likelihood. The common law relating to the admissibility of confessions by persons suffering a mental disorder or disability was summarised by Gleeson CJ in R versus Parker [(1989) 19 NSWLR ]
at 183-4, and what his Honour there said is applicable, mutatis mutandis, to the relevant provisions of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). As his
Honour observed, "Persons who are intellectually handicapped or who suffer from disease or disorder of the mind are by no means necessarily incapable of telling, or admitting, the truth." The possibility that the accused falsely implicated himself in the death of his wife is, again, a matter properly to be considered in the trial but does not render the evidence inadmissible.

I am satisfied that the circumstances in which the accused's admissions were made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of them was adversely effected. Accordingly, the precondition to their admissibility set by [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s85.html) has been met.
 [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) [s 90.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s90.html) 
Mrs Nash submitted, in the alternative, that it would be unfair to the accused to admit the evidence of his admissions, relying upon [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s90.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), which provides as follows: "In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if: the evidence is adduced by the prosecution; and having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence." 
The section is a statutory expression of the familiar common law discretion to reject confessional evidence when it would be unfair to use it against an accused at his or her trial. The principles were succinctly expressed, with reference to relevant High Court authority, by Hunt J (as his Honour then was) in R versus Merritt & Roso [(1985) 19 A Crim R 360] at -8. As at common law, the onus is on the accused to show that the evidence should be rejected on this basis. The question of fairness involves a consideration of all the relevant circumstances, which may, but need not, include impropriety on the part of the interrogating police. The effect of those circumstances on the reliability of the confession has long been considered a relevant matter: see, for example, The King versus Lee <case>; [(1950) 82 CLR 133] at 153. In this respect and, no doubt, in others, there is some overlap between [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s90.html) and [s 85.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s85.html) 
Obviously, the accused's mental state at the time of the admissions is a relevant matter. In Parker (supra), Gleeson CJ observed (also at p 183): "Further, even if the confessional evidence is admissible, the intellectual or mental state of the accused may, in a number of possible ways, go to the exercise of a trial judge's discretion to reject the evidence: cf McDermott v
The King [(1948) 76 CLR 501]; R versus Lee. It may, for example, touch upon the propriety of the means by which the confessional statement was obtained, the reliability of the statement itself, and the fairness involved in permitting the statement to be used against the accused." 
Whether the fact that the trial is before me, sitting without a jury, bears upon this question is a matter which I have considered, but have not decided.
Obviously, a judge is more attuned to the dangers of confessional evidence than a jury. If this were not a trial by judge alone, it may be that a jury would need to be warned about their approach to the accused's admission in the light of his mental state at the time: cf Parker (supra) at 183G-184A.
However, I am content to consider the matter as I would if the tribunal of fact were a jury.

In this case, the exercise of the discretion is guided by the matters which I have already considered for the purpose of [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s85.html) The accused's admissions are not, on their face, unreliable. Despite his undoubtedly depressed state, he appears to have given an intelligible account of relevant events to his cousin and to the interviewing detectives. In the recorded interview there is nothing to suggest that he is unable to deal with the situation in which he found himself, and he seems able to understand what is asked of him and to respond appropriately. When speaking to his cousin and to the interviewing detectives it appears that he appreciated his right to silence, but had decided to waive it. Apart from the question of arranging a psychiatric assessment, to which I referred earlier, no criticism has been levelled against the manner in which he was treated by any of the police: nor could it be.

In his valuable judgment on confessional evidence in Collins versus R <case>; [(1980) 31 ALR 257], Brennan J (as his Honour then was) dealt with the common law discretion to reject a voluntary confession in the interests of fairness to the accused. At p 314, his Honour observed, "Unfairness is not so much to be found as a fact as to be judged as a value." Among the factors favouring admission of the evidence, his Honour said, is "that it is generally desirable that probative and admissible evidence in proof of crime be admitted for consideration of the tribunal of fact ... " 
Guided by these principles, I am not persuaded that it would be unfair to the accused to receive the evidence of his admissions. Accordingly, the evidence will be admitted.

Postscript.

On 27 August 1997 I informed the parties that I would admit the evidence, noting that that decision should not be taken as any indication of the weight which might be afforded to it. I undertook to give my reasons later. However, before I had completed these reasons, the accused pleaded guilty to manslaughter and the Crown accepted that plea in discharge of the indictment for murder.
