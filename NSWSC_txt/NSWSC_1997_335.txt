Selosse versus Whitten Matter No 90204/97 [1997] NSWSC 335 (26 August 1997) ` 
Mary-Ann SELOSSE on behalf of Morna Frances KNIGHT` `v Raymond Laurence WHITTEN` ` 90204/97` `26 August 1997` `Graham AJ` `The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division` /97 - MARY-ANN SELOSSE ON BEHALF OF MORNA FRANCES KNIGHT versus RAYMOND LAURENCE WHITTEN 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: Whether a contract for the provision of legal services is to be viewed as an entire contract or not is a question to be decided in each case. In In Re Romer & Haslam [(1893) 2 QB 286] at 301 Lord Justice Kaye said, "If a solicitor is retained in a civil action (it is immaterial whether it be an action at law or in equity), prima facie his contract is entire; it is a contract to carry the matter through to a conclusion. The result of this is that he has no right under the statute to send in his bill and insist upon payment until the conclusion of the business to conduct which he was retained.
But when we come to apply this rule to a complicated litigation, which may last a considerable time, it is difficult to apply it literally, and to say that the solicitor cannot send in his bill till there has been a final conclusion of the proceedings, and that the contract is an entire contract in such a sense that the solicitor has no remedy for his costs till that period has arrived. In such a case as that the Courts have said that the rule must be applied differently, and that the solicitor may send in his bill at a reasonable break in the proceedings, and demand payment of it..." 
In more recent times the rigid approach of the past has yielded to a more pragmatic flexible one (Davidsons versus Jones-Fenleigh [[1980] 124 Solicitors'
Journal 204).] 
If a solicitor makes it clear to a client that a request for payment of fees is a final request for payment for services rendered to date rather than a request for payment on account, and the contract is not an entire contract, then a bill for services rendered may stand alone.

In this case it would appear that the late Donald H Knight perished when the aircraft in which he was flying (VH-MFK) was involved in an accident and destroyed. His widow, Morna Frances Knight, as executrix of his estate retained the defendant, trading as Whittens Lawyers and Consultants, to act for her late husband's estate in respect of a claim on his insurers for hull damage to the aircraft. A costs agreement was entered into and dated 3 August
This agreement provided for the payment of fees at hourly rates for Mr
Whitten and others, including an hourly rate for "Paralegal/Secretary". It also provided for the payment for disbursements incurred.

In respect of "Method of Billing and Payment" the agreement provided as follows: - "5. We will send you a bill four (sic) our charges and expenses: at the end of each month, while the Work is in progress; and/or when the Work is completed.

We may ask you to pay to us an amount to enable payment of expenses, or to provide security for them and our charges. In that case, we will assume, upon receipt of your payment, your authority to draw on the money paid for our charges and expenses, as they become due.

We will also assume your authority is given for any judgment or settlement moneys to be paid directly to our trust account and to pay ourselves from this money immediately after sending you our bill of costs." 
In my opinion this agreement authorised the transmission of periodic accounts as final bills. Whilst the words "We may ask you to...provide security...for our charges" lead to the opposite conclusion, I consider the expression "we will assume, upon receipt of your payment, your authority to draw on the money paid for our charges and expenses, as they become due" justifies the conclusion which I have drawn.

In this case five periodic accounts were rendered to Mrs Knight and these recorded that the moneys charged for fees and disbursements were "now due".

The accounts which were rendered bore date 29 September 1995 to 29 February
Details of the memoranda of costs and disbursements were as follows: - 
Date of Amount Period Date paid 
Memorandum claimed covered Sept 1995 $862 2 Aug 1995- 10 Nov 1995 Sept 1995 Oct 1995 $1,125 18 Oct 1995- 22 Dec 1995 Oct 1995 Dec 1995 $5,762 2 Nov 1995- 30 Jan 1996 Dec 1995 Jan 1996 $516.50 13 Dec 1995- 6 Mar 1996 Dec 1995 Feb 1996 $246 23 Jan 1996- 11 Mar 1996 Feb 1996 
The evidence indicates that the memoranda of costs and disbursements were given to Mrs Knight by sending same to her by post at her business address care of Tyson McCarthy Services Pty Limited at Narranderra. In accordance with s 160 of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/)  the memorandum dated and presumably posted on 19 January 1996 may be presumed to have been received by Mrs Knight on 25 January 1996.

Mrs Knight's daughter, Mary-Ann Selosse, holds a general power of attorney to do anything on her mother's behalf which she may lawfully authorise an attorney to do. Query whether this extends to actions taken by Mrs Knight as executrix of her late husband's estate but no objection is taken by Mr Whitten to the current proceedings on this ground.

In January - February 1997 Mrs Selosse, on behalf of her mother, lodged an application with the court for an assessment of costs charged to her mother by
Mr Whitten.

For reasons which will shortly appear it is important to understand the sequence of events in and around the making of the application: - the application bears date Monday 13 January 1997; it was posted to the Supreme Court on Tuesday 14 January 1997; an application which has become Exhibit 3 was received by the court on
Thursday 16 January 1997; a filing fee of $100 for a costs assessment was received by the court on
Friday 17 January 1997; a duplicate original of the application but one with a number of attachments (Exhibit 2), including copies of all of the above mentioned memoranda of costs and disbursements, was received by the court on Friday 24
January 1997; each of the first application and the duplicate application identified the costs which were the subject of the application as those included in "the bill of costs...dated 3 August '95", a copy of which is attached; there was no bill of costs bearing that date. The Costs Agreement between
Mrs Knight and Mr Whitten had borne the date 3 August 1995; the court wrote to Mrs Selosse and drew her attention to this anomaly; on Monday 3 February 1997 Mrs Selosse attended at the court's registry and altered the date 3 August 1995 in both the first application and the duplicate application to read "1 March 1996" although, in the case of Exhibit 2, the date was expressed in an abbreviated form; on 3 February 1997 the court marked the first application as "Filed 3 Feb ".

It may be observed that the date 1 March 1996 is not the date of any of the above-mentioned memoranda of costs and disbursements. It is, however, the date shown in the remittance advice referrable to the amount claimed under the 29
February 1996 memorandum and the amount outstanding in respect of the 19
January 1996 memorandum which was sent to Mrs Knight by Mr Whitten with the 29
February 1996 memorandum as "Date Sent".

The duplicate original of the application in its original form can be construed as an application for the assessment of all of the costs.

In its amended form I consider it to be an application for the assessment of the memoranda of 19 January 1996 and 29 February 1996 alone ie, those under which the total amount of $762.50 was claimed in the said Remittance Advice (see <case> of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) ).

Subject to what appears hereafter this does not mean that the application cannot be further amended to embrace the earlier memoranda or some of them.

What is presently before the court is a notice of motion filed by Mr Whitten as respondent to the application for assessment of costs seeking the following relief against Mrs Selosse, namely: - a declaration pursuant to [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s199.html) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) and [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/index.html#p7)
Division 3 Regulation 25 of the Regulations of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) that there is no entitlement for the Applicant to have assessed by a costs assessor pursuant to the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) the
Respondent's Bills of Costs to Mrs Morna Knight dated 29 September 1995, 31
October 1995, 14 December 1995 and 19 January 1996.
 an order that Mr Whitten's Bill of Costs dated 29 February 1996 be referred to a costs assessor for assessment and, an order that Mrs Selosse pay Mr Whitten's costs of this motion.

It may be observed that no relief is sought in respect of the assessment of the memorandum of costs and disbursements of 29 February 1996 by way of declaratory relief.

Insofar as relief is sought against Mrs Selosse, the present application is, in my opinion, misconceived. However, I will deal with the issues raised on the basis that Mrs Knight is seen to be the relevant applicant.

The relevant statutory provisions include [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s193.html) of the [Legal Profession
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) which provides for the form of bills of costs as follows: - "193. (1) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the form of, and the particulars to be included in, bills of costs.

A bill of costs may be described as a memorandum of fees or in any other way authorised by the regulations." 
Under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s173.html) a "bill of costs" means a bill of costs for providing legal services, and includes a memorandum of fees.

The prescribed requirements for bills of costs are to be found in regulation
A which relevantly provided as follows: - "22A. (1) For the purposes of [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s193.html) of the Act, the following particulars are to be included in a bill of costs: 
A description of the legal service provided.

The total amount of the costs charged.

Any intended claim for interest under [section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s190.html) of the Act if the costs are not paid (including the rate of interest).

The work done in providing the legal service.

The period over which that work was done.

The identity of the persons who did that work (including the position of the persons e.g. partner, associate).

The basis on which the costs have been calculated and charged (whether on a lump sum basis, an hourly rate basis, an item of work basis, a part of proceedings basis or other basis).

The facts relied on to justify the costs charged by reference to the above, the practitioner's skill, labour and responsibility, the complexity, novelty or difficulty of the matter, the quality of the work done or any other relevant matter.

However, the particulars referred to in subclause (1)(d)-(h) need not be included in the bill of costs if: the total amount of costs charged is the amount, or an amount calculated on the basis, set out in a costs agreement for the legal service made under
Division 3 of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/index.html#p11) of the Act or disclosed in accordance with Division 2 of the Part; and the bill of costs refers to the relevant costs agreement or disclosure document.

A bill of costs may comprise more than 1 document." 
In relation to applications by clients for assessment of costs in bills, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s199.html) provides as follows: - "199. (1) A client who is given a bill of costs may apply to the proper officer of the Supreme Court for an assessment of the whole of, or any part of, those costs.

An application relating to a bill of costs may be made if the costs have been wholly or partly paid. If the costs have been wholly or partly paid, the application is to be made within the period prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection.

If any costs have been paid without a bill of costs, the client may nevertheless apply for an assessment. For that purpose the request for payment by the barrister or solicitor is taken to be the bill of costs.

In this section, "client" includes any person who is a party to a costs agreement relating to legal services for which the bill of costs is given, other than the barrister or solicitor who gave the bill or who provided the services." 
The time prescribed by [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s199.html) of the Act for applications relating to bills is the period of 12 months after the bill was given to the client (Reg 25).

In the present case the memoranda of costs and disbursements of 19 January and 29 February 1996 fall within the reach of the application under [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s199.html) of the Act.

In reaching this conclusion I have assumed the memoranda to amount to bills of costs within the meaning of the Act and not simply memoranda which are to be "taken to be" bills of costs within the meaning of [s (3).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s119.html)
If they are of the latter kind then no statutory limitation upon seeking assessment thereof applies in the present circumstances.

Having said that, I do consider the memoranda made up of the several documents which are annexures F and G to Mrs Selosse's affidavit sworn 8 May 1997 constitute bills of costs within the meaning of regulation 22A. They do not refer to the costs agreement of 3 August 1995 and hence do not enjoy the benefit of Reg 22A(2). Accordingly, to be valid bills they must meet each of the requirements of Reg 22A(1). As I see it, they do. It is true that the identity of the persons who did the work is given in code form ie, "RLW" and "AMF" and no description of their respective positions is indicated. However, in the context of the costs agreement between the parties I consider that the reference to "RLW" may be seen as a reference to Mr Whitten and the reference to "AMF" as a reference to a paralegal/secretary.

Mr McQuillen who appears for Mrs Selosse on the present motion submits that
Reg 22A(1)(g) has not been complied with. I disagree. Clearly, the basis on which the costs have been calculated is a charge per "unit". What is not made clear is what a unit is but the basis of the calculation is nominated.
Again, in the context of the costs agreement, it is obvious that ten units equals one hour and I think this is sufficient.

Turning to the earlier memoranda dated 29 September 1995, 31 October 1995 and December 1995, there is no evidence which would justify a conclusion that the first two mentioned were bills of costs within the meaning of Reg 22A.
Neither of them would appear to have been accompanied by a detailed computer print-out of work done, time spent, amounts charged et cetera and the same goes for the disbursements. Whilst the memoranda of 29 September and 31
October are not, in the light of my earlier observations, presently part of the application for assessment, they are nevertheless amenable to assessment without regard to the 12 month time limit by virtue of [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s199.html) of the Act.

The memorandum of 14 December 1995 falls into a different category. If one turns to annexures E1 and E2 of Mrs Selosse's affidavit and to the annexures to Exhibit 2 it becomes clear that this memorandum, like those of 19 January and 29 February 1996, did satisfy the requirements of Reg 22A.

Alas, from Mrs Knight's point of view, the application for assessment of the costs covered by this memorandum is now out of time. I am satisfied that it was posted to Mrs Knight on or about 14 December 1995 and accordingly any challenge to it now would be out of time.

Mr McQuillen has urged me to require an assessment of the costs covered by this memorandum in the exercise of the court's inherent jurisdiction. The court undoubtedly has power to order such an assessment but it seems to me that no proper basis has been established for its so doing. The total of the fees charged by Mr Whitten has been $8,511.50 which may be compared with Mr
Whitten's estimate, for the purposes of the Act, of $2,800 to $5,500. It does not seem to me that the fees charged were so far removed from the amount of the assessment as to warrant the intervention of the court.

At the heel of the hunt, after the matter had been fully argued, Mr McQuillen submitted that the present application is misconceived on another basis namely, that there is express provision in the Act for appeals as to matters of law under [ss
K](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208k.html) and [208L](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s208l.html) and that, in the circumstances, it would be wrong for the court to seek to regulate the conduct of the Costs Assessor's determination of the application.

Insofar as the motion seeks orders directing the Principal Registrar as to the exercise of his functions or directions as to the conduct of the assessment, I agree with what Mr McQuillen has submitted. However, given the view which I have formed as to the content of the current application, it does not seem to me inappropriate for the solicitor to be denied declaratory relief as to the application of the time limitation contained in [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s199.html) in relation to other memoranda of costs and disbursements which are not presently covered by the application which has been filed.

Whilst the procedure adopted of seeking declaratory relief by way of notice of motion in the costs assessment application may be irregular, I do not think that relief ought to be declined on that ground alone, given the time which has been spent on the argument of the matter by both sides.

In all the circumstances, I propose with some modifications, to make a declaration as sought but restricted to Mr Whitten's memorandum of costs and disbursements of 14 December 1995.

Were I not of the view that orders directing the future conduct of the costs assessment were inappropriate, I would consider it unnecessary, in any event, to make orders in respect of the memoranda of costs and disbursements which are to proceed to assessment or may hereafter proceed to assessment.

The order of the court will be, declare pursuant to [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/s199.html) of the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/lpa1987179/) and Reg of the Legal Profession Regulation that there is no entitlement for Morna
Frances Knight to have assessed by a Costs Assessor the respondent, Mr
Whitten's, bill of costs dated 14 December 1995.

In my opinion, the proper order in respect of costs, in the circumstances, is an order that the respondent, Mr Whitten, pay two thirds of the applicant's costs and I so order.
