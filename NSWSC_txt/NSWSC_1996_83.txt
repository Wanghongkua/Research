JUDGE1
KIRBY P Before the Court are proceedings removed into the Court of Appeal by orders of Dowd J in the Motor Accidents List of the Common Law Division of the
Supreme Court.
 
Constitutional issues: Australian [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) [s 118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s118.html) [2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s2.html). The [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) of the Australian Commonwealth includes a section apt to promote and ensure the respect throughout the nation of the statutory and other laws, and judicial decisions, of the component parts of the Federation.
[Section 118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s118.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) reads: "118. Full faith and credit shall be given, throughout the
Commonwealth to the laws, the public Acts and records, and the judicial proceedings of every State."
The section affords to Australian courts an ample warrant (indeed, in my view a command) to give respect to the laws (legislative, judicial and otherwise) made or pronounced in different parts of Australia.
Given its full meaning, the section provides Australian lawyers with the means of advancing beyond the mentality by which each jurisdiction of the new nation was regarded, in some respects at least, as foreign, so that rules of private international law were applied to them as if their statutes and judicial decisions were in no way different, in relation to each other, from those of
Mongolia or Haiti.
See D St L Kelly, Locating Rules in the Conflict of Laws, , 103f cited W M C Gummow, "Full Faith and Credit in Three Federations", Sth Carolina L Rev 979, 987 (1995).
Unfortunately, this view of [s 118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s118.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) has not yet commanded majority assent in the High Court of Australia. This is despite the compelling dissenting opinions which have been written to advance the approach which I respectfully prefer. See e.g. McKain versus R W Miller and Co (SA) Pty
Limited <case>; [(1991) 174 CLR 1], 461, 464. The result is that Australian courts persist with the fiction, increasingly odd and even sometimes offensive on its face, that, as Windeyer J said in Pederson v Young <case>; [(1964) 110 CLR 162], 170, the Australian States are "separate countries in private international law".
The further consequence of this approach to the constitutional provision has been a series of highly inconvenient, often disputed and also criticised court decisions by which legislation of a particular Australian State or
Territory, apparently applicable to events occurring in that State or
Territory, is avoided or circumvented by the simple expedient of commencing proceedings in another State or Territory (or in the High Court) and invoking private international law rules to escape the application of the local law.
See e.g. Breavington versus Godleman and Ors <case>; [(1989) 169 CLR 41]; [(1993) 176 CLR ], and
Chisholm versus Pasminco Metals-BHAS Pty Limited, Court of Appeal , unreported, 24 July 1995; (1995) NSWJB 67.
Of course, the current approach has its supporters. It has endured for nearly a century in the Australian Commonwealth. A like approach is applied in other federal countries. See eg Allstate Insurance Co versus Hague <case>; [449 US 302], 308 . See also Gummow, above, 981; R H Jackson, "Full Faith and Credit - The
Lawyer's Clause of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/)" 45 Columbia L Rev 1, 19ff (1945). It sometimes permits litigants to pick and choose amongst available jurisdictions within the federation whose procedures best advantage them. See eg F K
Juenger, "What's Wrong with Forum Shopping?" [[1994] SydLawRw 1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/SydLawRw/1994/1.html "View Case" ); [(1994) 16 Syd L Rev 5], 11. It may also sometimes promote procedural reform and jurisdictional competition. It certainly presents intriguing questions requiring mental gymnastics and producing outcomes that are intellectually fascinating in their oddity. But many critics abhor the "forum shopping" which takes place. Cf P Dane, "Vested
Rights, 'Vestedness' and Choice of Law" [96 Yale LJ 1191], 1216 (1987). They are appalled by the effective evasion of local law. They resent the effective undermining of the jurisdiction of local legislatures and their power, as they think best, to control, cap or limit financial outgoings for the protection of taxpayers who must otherwise provide the revenue necessary for such outgoings.
And they feel increasingly attracted to the notion explained by Deane J in
Stevens, at 461, that Australia is: " a single nation with a unitary system of law, in the sense...
explained in Breavington. ... Any denial of that perception...
flawed by an unjustifiable under estimation of the extent of the compact between the Australian people and a mistaken denial of the fundamental imperative embodied in [s 118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s118.html) of that compact".

See also Gummow. above, 1005, 1012.
In Chisholm, I expressed my respectful preference for the minority opinions in the High Court of Australia concerning [s 118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s118.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/).
But in that case, as in the present, I was bound to conform to the majority view of that section expressed in the High Court. This requires me to treat [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s118.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) as irrelevant (or satisfied) before proceeding to apply the rules of private international law to the intra Australian problem which is here presented for solution.
The present case provides an example of theimportance of giving full faith and credit to [s 118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s118.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). In the view which I favour, that provision provides the solution to the issues raised by these cases. One party asks this Court, as a court in the Australian judicial hierarchy, to give full effect to express provisions of an Act of the Victorian Parliament, and to apply, in respect of the meaning and effect of a relevant provisions of that
Act, the view as to its character and operation expressed by the highest court of the State of Victoria. It would not have been surprising, in a nation such as Australia, that [s 118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s118.html), would command this Court to give full effect to the
Victorian statute and the Victorian judicial proceeding. For the defendants, it was formally submitted that [s 118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s118.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) governed the case, and to the extent necessary overrode the nineteenth century common law rule of private international law expressed in Phillips versus Eyre [(1870) LR 6 QB 1] or its more recent variants. However, it was conceded by the defendants, rightly, that binding authority of majority opinions of the High Court restrain this
Court from adopting that approach.
It may be hoped that the High Court will take an early opportunity to reconsider its opinion of [s 118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s118.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). Meanwhile, courts in the
Australian hierarchy below the High Court must continue to labour with the "modified principles" of private international law applicable to cases such as the present. Legislatures (as illustrated in this case) seek to anticipate and affect the application of those rules in order to uphold their authority over facts and circumstances of primary territorial concern to them. Sometimes to no avail. Sometimes with suggested misunderstanding of the currently applicable rules. See Gardner versus Wallace, unreported, High Court of Australia (Dawson J), 10 November 1995.
 
Procedural matters
The proceedings before the Court were removed into the Court of Appeal pursuant to [Pt 12](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/index.html#p12), r 2 SCR. The suggested purpose of the removal was so that agreed issues might be determined, those issues having been separated by Dowd
J pursuant to [Pt 31](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/index.html#p31) r 2 SCR.
There are certain disadvantages in the procedure adopted, in which the
Court of Appeal had no part. The Court has no opinion of the judge of the
Division. The parties are deprived of an appeal as of right from orders consequential upon the legal holdings involved. This Court is deprived of any relevant findings of fact. It enjoys no analysis of the legal issues or the expression of opinion of the primary judge. The reference was made in March
Had the cases proceeded to conclusion, all issues in dispute could, by now, have been determined, factual findings made and an appeal heard, if necessary with expedition, to bring the entire litigation in the Supreme Court to a close. Instead, all that this Court will now do is to respond to issues which the parties have agreed and the judge has referred to it.
Pursuant to the orders of Dowd J, notices were given under [s 78B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s78b.html) of the [Judiciary Act 1903](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth). The Court has been informed that none of the law officers of Australia wished to intervene in the proceedings.
The exact way in which the proceedings were considered in the Division was never made entirely clear. At one stage there was a suggestion that an application was made for the cross-vesting of the proceedings to the Supreme
Court of Victoria. If such application were made, its outcome is unknown.
Presumably it was unsuccessful. Similarly, it is not known whether the issues now before the Court of Appeal arose in the course of hearing a motion for a permanent stay of the proceedings in the Division. The record is defective, as tends not infrequently to be the case where the ordinary course of proceedings is interrupted by the isolation of particular issues and the removal of the matter, or part of it, to another part of the Supreme Court.
The Court decided to proceed with the hearing, notwithstanding misgivings which arose out of the foregoing. It did so upon assurances that the record would be put in order, that no relevant factual dispute arose between the parties and that all of them wished the Court of Appeal to respond to the questions posed. The parties suggested that the telescoping of the ordinary procedures was jusfified in the cases by the general importance of the questions raised. Upon one view, if those questions were answered favourably to the plaintiffs, many persons, ordinarily resident in and injured in motor accidents in the State of Victoria (particularly, perhaps, those living near the border with New South Wales), might seek to circumvent the limitations imposed by the Victorian legislation (Transport Accident Act 1986 (Vic) ("the
Victorian
Act")) by the simple expedient of crossing into this State, suffering some part of the damage complained of in New South Wales and proceeding in New South Wales to sue the tortfeasor said to be liable by the common law, who could be rendered accountable in the courts of New South Wales in a way which would not be possible (or so easily possible) in the courts of
Victoria. See Flaherty v
Girgis <case>; [(1987) 162 CLR 574]
To say that this result would be inconvenient to the due administration of the Transport Accident Act of Victoria, would be something of an understatement. Yet recent cases in the series already referred to demonstrate that convenience may not necessarily govern the outcome. Sometimes, to overcome inconvenient court decisions of this kind, legislation, including uniform legislation, is enacted in the attempt to avoid the suggested inconvenience. See e.g. [Choice of Law (Limitation Periods) Act 1993](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/colpa1993301/), [s 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/colpa1993301/s5.html) and [Limitation of Actions Act 1936](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/loaa1936226/) (SA), [s 38A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/loaa1936226/s38a.html) dealt with in Chisholm and questioned in Gardner.
In the course of the hearing of the proceeding, it was agreed that the
Court should deal with the case of Thompson versus Hill. It was common ground that most of the relevant facts in Clark versus Fowler were identical,
The only point of distinction was that, in the latter case, the plaintiff, Mr Clark, had, pursuant to <case>(a) of the Victorian
Act, obtained a certificate, as there referred to, permitting him to bring proceedings for the recovery of damages in Victoria. No such certificate had been sought or obtained by Mr Thompson.
To that extent, Mr Thompson lacked the procedural advantage (if any) that Mr
Clark's certificate afforded him in a court in proceedings brought in New
South Wales. Pursuant to the agreement of the parties,
I will therefore deal only with Mr Thompson's case. Upon the resolution of the legal questions presented by it, the Court also had the assistance of Mr Clark's counsel. It will be left to a judge in the Division to apply to Mr Clark's case the holdings in Mr Thompson's case, with whatever modifications are appropriate when the facts are found.
 
The agreed facts
According to the Statement of
Agreed Facts, Mr Paul Thompson (the plaintiff) was injured on 8 November 1992. He was a pedestrian. Mr Craig Hill (the defendant) was the driver of a registered motor vehicle AZW-056. The incident occurred at Racecourse Road, Flemington in the State of Victoria.
At the time, the defendant was a resident of the State of Victoria. For the purpose of this application only, the defendant concedes that at the time of the accident, the plaintiff was a resident of New South Wales. It is also agreed that at the time of the accident, the plaintiff was employed in New
South Wales. He has worked in New South Wales since the accident. He has also received medical treatment in this State.
On 9 December 1992, the plaintiff submitted a claim form to the Transport
Accident Commission of
Victoria. That body is established by <case> of the
Victorian Act. The Commission has not made a determination under <case> or of the Victorian Act. It has not issued any certificate in writing, pursuant to <case>, consenting to the bringing of legal proceedings by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had made no application pursuant to <case>(d) for leave to bring such proceedings. The proceedings were commenced in the Supreme
Court of New South Wales on 29 September 1994. The question thus posed is the relevance, in New South
Wales, of the provisions of the Victorian Act, both procedural and substantive.
 
The Victorian Act
The [Transport Accident Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/taa1986204/) (Vic) is one of a series of statutes enacted in several jurisdictions in Australia designed to contain the costs of claims for death and personal injury arising out of the use of motor vehicles.
In this State, the relevant legislation was the Transport Accidents
Compensation Act 1987 (establishing the Transcover Scheme), later retrospectively repealed by the [Motor Accidents Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/), still in force. See
Taylor versus Francoif [(1990) 19 NSWLR 444 (CA)], 438.
The Victorian Act, in its turn, repealed the [Motor Accidents Act 1973](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/maa1973166/) . The Commission established by the Victorian Act was made the successor in law of the Motor Accidents Board of Victoria. See the Victorian Act, s (2).
The Court has not been taken to the detail of the Victorian Act. Its attention has been addressed only to <case>. However, it is appropriate to notice <case> which appears in Part 3 of the Act ("Compensation"). By that section it is provided: "35(1) A person who is injured as a result of a transport accident is entitled to compensation in accordance with this
Act if- the accident occurred in Victoria; or the accident occurred in another State or in a Territory and involved a registered motor vehicle and, at the time of the accident, the person was - a resident of Victoria; or the driver of, or a passenger in, the registered motor vehicle.
 ...

The Commission is not liable to pay compensation to a person in accordance with this Act unless the person is entitled to compensation."
By <case> of the
Act ("Definitions"): " 'Transport accident' means an incident directly caused by, or directly arising out of, the driving of a motor car or motor vehicle, a railway train or a tram. "
The scheme of the Act appears to be to impose the primary liability to pay compensation, for motor accidents within <case>, upon the Commission in accordance with the terms of the Victorian
Act. However, provision is made for the recovery of damages in certain cases. That provision is found in <case> of the Victorian Act.
That section appears in Part 6 ("Legal rights outside this
Act"). That Part is in turn subdivided. Section 93 appears in Division ("Damages in respect of death or serious injury"). The title gives the clue to the provision of damages. They are to be confined to "death or serious injury". Section 93 carries the heading "Actions for damages". The section has been repeatedly amended since
The relevant provisions of <case> include: "93(1)A person shall not recover any damages in any proceedings in respect of the injury or death of a person as a result of a transport accident occurring on or after the commencement of section except in accordance with this section.

A person who is injured as a result of a transport accident may recover damages in respect of the injury if - the Commission has determined the degree of impairment of the person under section 46A, (7) or 47(7A); and the injury is a serious injury.

If - under section 46A, 47(7) or 47(7A), the Commission has determined the degree of impairment of a person who is injured as a result of a transport accident; and the degree so determined is 30 percentum or more - the injury is deemed to be a serious injury within the meaning of this section.

If - under section 46A, 47(7) or 47(7A), the Commission has determined the degree of impairment of a person who is injured as a result of a transport accident; and the degree so determined is less than 30 percentum - the person may not bring proceedings for the recovery of damages in respect of the injury unless - the Commission - is satisfied that the injury is a serious injury; and issues to the person a certificate in writing consenting to the bringing of the proceedings; or a court, on the application of the person, gives leave to bring the proceedings.
 
A copy of an application under sub-section (4) (d) must be served on the Commission and on each person against whom the applicant claims to have a cause of action.

A court must not give leave under sub-section (4)(d) unless it is satisfied that the injury is a serious injury.

A court must not, in proceedings in accordance with sub-sections (2), (3) and (4), award to a person in respect of an injury -
Pecuniary loss damages - if the total pecuniary loss damages assessed, before any reduction in respect of the person's responsibility for the injury, is less than $20,000; or in excess of $450,000; or
Pain and suffering damages - if the total pain and suffering damages assessed, before any reduction in respect of the person's responsibility for the injury, is less than $20,000; or in excess of $200,000; or 
Damages of any other kind..."
There follow provisions in respect of claims under the [Wrongs Act 1958](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/wa1958111/) in respect of the death of a person as a result of a "transport accident" which I will not reproduce. Subs (10) excludes the recovery of damages, including in respect of services of a domestic nature. Subs (11) deals with quantification of death claims.
Subs (12) deals ("subject to the discretion of the Court") with the recovery of costs. Subss (13) and (14) deal with the discount rate and discounting of damages. Subss (15) and (16) control the award of interest. Subs (17) contains definitions of "pain and suffering damages" and "pecuniary loss damages". There is also a definition of "serious injury" as follows: " 'serious injury' means - serious long-term impairment or loss of a body function; or permanent serious disfigurement; or severe long-term mental or severe long-term behavioural disturbance or disorder; or loss of a foetus."
Subs (18) provides that nothing in subs (1) affects the right to compensation under various enactments of the Victorian Parliament providing for special entitlement to compensation for injury or death (e.g. under the [Juries Act 1967](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ja196797/) (Vic)) or under the general provisions of the [Accident
Compensation Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/aca1985204/) (Vic)). This was the form in which the Victorian Act, as amended, originally provided for the recovery of damages for injury or death resulting from a transport accident as defined by that Act.
I pass over <case> of the Victorian Act ("Payment to persons not resident in Victoria"), as no submissions were addressed to that section. I now reach important amendments to the Victorian Act which were introduced by the [Transport Accident (General Amendment) Act 1994](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/taaa1994339/) ("the Amending Act"). By <case> of the Amending Act, <case> of the Principal Act was amended. By <case> of the
Amending Act, subs (4), it is provided: "2(4) Section 40 is deemed to have come into operation on January 1987."
Section 40 provides: "40. After section 93(18) of the principal Act insert - '(19) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act, for the purposes of the [Limitation of Actions Act 1958](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/loaa1958226/), the cause of action in respect of the injury arises on the day of the transport accident or on the day on which the injury first manifested itself.

For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that all the provisions of this section contain matters that are substantive law and are not procedural in nature.'"
It is the terms of <case>(20) as included, purportedly with retrospective operation, by the Amending Act of 1994, that have given rise to much debate in these proceedings.
 
Issues to be decided
The issues which the parties agreed should be the subject of the reference to this Court are: 
Is [section 93](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/taa1986204/s93.html) of the [Transport Accident Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/taa1986204/) (hereinafter called "the Act") substantive or procedural? 
Alternatively, are some of the provisions of <case> of the Act substantive, i.e. <case>, (2), (3), (4), (7)(c), (10)? 
In respect of <case>, as amended by <case> of the [Transport Accident (General Amendment) Act 1994](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/taaa1994339/):
Does it have the effect of making <case> the substantive law of Victoria?
If so, does it have that effect in the context of the choice of law rules applicable in New South Wales?
If the answers to (a) and (b) are in the affirmative, does it have retrospective effect in New South Wales? 
Are the substantive rights of the parties governed by the law of the forum or alternatively the law of the place where the accident occurred, given that the proceedings are for the recovery of damages in respect of damage suffered by the plaintiff in New South Wales caused by a tort committed in
Victoria? 
The issues argued
The foregoing questions do not really portray the way in which the proceedings were argued before this Court. Before us, three significant issues were tendered for decision: 
Would the Court, as invited by the defendant, overrule its recent decision in Chisholm versus Pasminco Metals-BHAS
Pty Limited (above)? To this end, the defendant sought, on motion, the leave of the Court to re-argue the correctness of Chisholm; 
If the Court would not permit the holding in Chisholm to be re-argued (or otherwise affirmed the decision), could Chisholm be distinguished upon a point of difference between the South Australian legislation there in question and the Victorian Act, as amended, under present scrutiny? 
If the answer to each of the foregoing was "no", would the Court, in applying Chisholm, in its statement of the requirements of the High Court's holdings in Breavington, McKain, Stevens and Goryl nonetheless characterise the Victorian statutory provisions, for the purpose of the test laid down in
Breavington, as substantive and not procedural upon the footing that:
It should take into account that the Victorian Parliament has expressly, and with retrospective effect, stated this to be its intention;
It should follow, in this regard, a holding to that effect of the Appeal
Division of the Supreme
Court of Victoria in Wilson versus Nattras, unreported, 16
May 1995; or
Otherwise, because it comes to that conclusion upon its own analysis of the character of the relevant provisions of the Victorian Act, as amended?
I state immediately my conclusions upon the questions argued: 
The Court should not give leave to permit the re-argument of the correctness of Chisholm; 
Chisholm is not distinguishable upon the basis of the suggested point of difference in the South Australian Act argued for the defendant; and 
The Court, although not bound to do so, should follow the decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Victoria.
It should thus hold that the Victorian Act had extinguished the right to recover common law damages in respect of a motor accident in Victoria so that <case> is substantive. Upon that footing, in application of the private international law principles established in Breavington and explained in Stevens versus Head, the plaintiff may not sue the defendant for damages in New South Wales. He is confined to the remedies that are afforded to him in Victoria, including to "restored damages" in limited circumstances and subject to the requirements laid down by <case> of the Victorian Act.
 
Re argument of Chisholm refused
Chisholm was a case concerning a person allegedly injured in the course of his employment in South Australia between 1970 and 1980. He returned to New
South Wales in 1980.
Lead poisoning, allegedly as a result of his South
Australian employment, was not diagnosed until 1992. He promptly instructed a solicitor who, in August 1993, commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of this State to recover damages from the employer for negligence. His claim was struck out by Finlay J who held himself bound to treat the limitation law of
South Australia as part of the substantive law by virtue of [s 38A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/loaa1936226/s38a.html) of the [Limitation of Actions Act 1936](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/loaa1936226/) (SA). In this Court, Sheller JA (with whom
Powell JA agreed) proceeded to apply the tests stated in Breavington and
McKain. Whilst expressing my preference for obedience to the constitutional obligation, by <case>, to give full faith and credit to the South Australian legislation, I held myself bound to agree in the approach favoured by Sheller
JA, applying the majority holdings of the High Court in the aforementioned decisions.
That majority approach mandates for Australian courts in respect of intra national torts having a connection with several jurisdictions the modified application of the Phillips versus Eyre tests stated in McKain, at 39, in these terms: "A plaintiff may sue in the forum to enforce a liability in respect of a wrong occurring outside the territory of the forum if - 1. the claim arises out of circumstances of such a character that, if they had occurred within the territory of the forum, a cause of action would have arisen entitling the plaintiff to enforce against the defendant a civil liability of the kind which the plaintiff claims to enforce; and 2. by the law of the place in which the wrong occurred, the circumstances of the occurrence give rise to a civil liability of the kind which the plaintiff claims to enforce."
In Chisholm, applying this test, the question for this Court became what operation it would give, in this State, to the terms of an amendment to the
South Australian limitations statute which provided, relevantly: "38A. (1) A limitation law of the State is a substantive law of the State.

A limitation law of another State or a Territory of the
Commonwealth or of New Zealand is to be regarded as a substantive law of that place and applied according."
Cognate legislation has now been enacted in this State.
See [Choice of Law (Limitation Periods) Act 1993](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/colpa1993301/). However, that legislation did not have application to Mr Chisholm's case because of the reservation in [s 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/colpa1993301/s4.html) that it should not apply "to proceedings instituted before the commencement of this
Act". What then, was the effect to be given to the South Australian Act, without benefit of a New South Wales counterpart? Sheller JA explained: "Section 38A in the form passed in 1993 required a South
Australian court applying South Australian law to treat a limitation of action imposed by the South
Australian Act as part of the substantive law of the State. But a New South Wales court in deciding whether a law is substantial (semble substantive) or procedural applies New South Wales law. When the plaintiff filed his statement of claim in August ,
according to New South Wales conflict of laws rules, procedural law was governed by the law of the forum alone and s 36(1) of the South Australian Act was a procedural law; McKain versus RW
Miller and Co. The South Australian legislature cannot abrogate or override New South Wales conflict of law rules. The substitution of a new <case> in the South Australian Act acknowledged this in the case where South Australian courts are considering a limitation law of another State or Territory or of New Zealand. ... If a similar provision (to <case> (2)) had been in force in New South Wales at the relevant time the
New
South Wales court would have been bound to regard the South
Australian [Limitation Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/la133/) as a substantive law of that State.
But at the relevant time there was no such provision in New
South Wales and accordingly, applying the law of the forum, the
New South Wales court was bound to treat the South Australian limitation as procedural and so not operating as a limitation of action in proceedings commenced in New South Wales.
Accordingly ... his Honour erred in striking out the statement of claim on this ground." 
The respective cases of the parties on overrating Chisholm
The arguments of the parties in these proceedings, based upon Chisholm, can readily be understood. For the plaintiff, it was asserted that, similarly,
New South Wales choice of law rules, under the revised formulation in McKain, reserved to New South Wales law alone the decision on whether the Victorian
Act, <case>, as amended, was substantive or procedural. By that law it would be treated as procedural only. The enactment of <case>(20) in the Victorian Act would not alter, for a New South Wales court, the quality and character of the law. Such a self-serving statement might be taken into account. But it could not bid a New South Wales court in performing its responsibility of characterising the disputed section. If, in fact, the requirements of the section, properly understood by comparison with such decisions as Stevens, were seen to be procedural, the mere fact that, for its own purposes, the
Victorian Parliament had said otherwise, would not decide the question, at least in a New South Wales court applying its law. Cf Gardner, 2. Insofar as the Victorian Appeal
Division had determined that <case> of the Victorian Act was substantive and effectively abolished common law rights (reviving such rights only by its own terms and under its specified conditions), that decision would likewise not bid this Court. It would be duty bound to reach its own conclusions in the application of New South Wales law alone.
For the defendant it was submitted that
Chisholm was wrong. The Court should say so. It should distinguish the case by reference to the terms of the
South Australian Act.
But even if it applied Chisholm, it would do so taking into account the characterisation of the term's of <case> adopted by subs (20) of the Victorian Act. It would follow the decision of the Victorian Appeal
Division in this regard. If necessary, it would reach its own conclusion that s 93, so far as it abolished common law rights to damages, was substantive and not procedural.
 
Such a recent decision should not be overruled
Chisholm was decided as recently as 24 July 1995. The defendant recognised the difficulty of persuading the Court to overrule it. The practice of the Court required that leave be sought to re-argue the correctness of a holding of law. Proctor versus Jentway Aviation Pty Limited [(1984) 1 NSWLR 166 ], 171, 180.
In support of the reconsideration of Chisholm, the defendant urged: 
The ultimate duty of a court is to apply the law. If error is plainly demonstrated, it should be corrected. "It is not ... better that the Court should be persistently wrong than that it should be ultimately right."
Australian Agricultural Co. and Ors versus Federated Engine-drivers and Firemen's
Association of Australasia <case>; [(1913) 17 CLR 261], 172; 
By the test of plain error, Chisholm invited reconsideration, At least within the Australian federation, to apply the choice of law rules by ignoring a classification of statutory provisions as substantive where expressly so provided in the statute itself, portrayed clear error. By that criterion, leave to re-argue the point should be given. See King and Mergen Holdings Pty
Limited v McKenzie [(1991) 24 NSWLR 305 (CA)], 518; 
The decision was so recent that it had not yet become a settled principle of the law which a court would hesitate to disturb. Cf. Gardner
Smith Pty Limited versus The Ship "Tomoe 8"(1990) [19 NSWLR 588 (SC).] The Court should therefore take this early opportunity to review it.
For a number of reasons, I believe that the invitation to overrule
Chisholm should be declined: 
I am far from convinced that, within the context of the traditional application of private international law rules within Australia, Chisholm was wrong. The more fundamental attack, that [s 118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s118.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) requires a completely different approach, is reserved to the High Court; 
Courts such as this should be cautious in overruling their earlier holding, at least where it cannot be said that developments of legal principle, or of society, make such holdings inappropriate, greatly inconvenient or show them to have been wrong. Rankin and Ors versus Baldi and Ors [(1985) 1 NSWLR 274 (CA)]; Bromley and Anor versus Housing Commission of New South Wales [(1985) 3 NSWLR (CA)], 35f, 
Special care should be taken in overruling a recent decision of the
Court, even where individual members of the Court have doubts as to its correctness. Otherwise, there will be no stability of legal principle. Parties will simply re-argue every uncongenial point in the hope of finding a (so constituted court as to be) susceptible to their argument. This could, in turn, result in a reaffirmation of the original principle by a later court, producing an unseemly difference in legal authority, depending upon the constitution of the bench. Such a course would undermine certainty. It would dissolve public confidence in the Court and in its legal process; 
Where it can clearly be shown that a statute or binding legal principle has been overlooked, a different approach might be taken. But such was not the case here. The defendant simply sought to re-argue the legal issue determined by Chisholm; 
A party discontented is not bereft of remedy. Special leave to appeal may be sought from the High Court of Australia. Although not sought in
Chisholm, it could be sought in this case. Alternatively, legislation might be invited to override the Court's decision. The recent spate of legislation enacted throughout Australasia, ostensibly to overcome choice of law decisions in the particular context of limitation periods, demonstrates that this course is not a forlorn hope.
The High Court has identified criteria upon the basis of which earlier decisions of that Court will be departed from. They include consideration of any earlier differences within the
Court; any substantial inconvenience which the past decision has occasioned; any reliance on the earlier decision which argues against its change; and consideration of the extent to which the earlier decision rests upon a principle derived from a long line of cases.
See
John versus Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia <case>; [(1989) 166
CLR 417], 535. The application of analogous principles in this Court (with proper modification for its different functions) confirms the conclusion that it would be inappropriate to reopen Chisholm. There was no relevant difference within this
Court. The decision has not been shown to cause inconvenience. Although it has not been relied upon, the principles stated are no more than those which have been regularly applied being derived from a long line of cases developed over a century.
I would refuse leave to re-argue Chisholm.
This Court is bound to conform to its holding.
 
Earlier decision cannot be distinguished
The defendant next sought to distinguish the terms of the legislation considered in Chisholm and <case>(20) of the Victorian Act. This was done on the footing that, in the
South Australian section considered in Chisholm, it was stated: "38A. (1) A limitation law of the State is a substantive law
OF
THE STATE." (emphasis added)
The argument ran that, by these last words, the South Australian
Parliament emphasised the territorial limitation of the characterisation which it was enacting. The [Limitation of Actions Act 1936](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consolact/loaa1936226/) (SA) was to be characterised as a substantive law but only for the purposes of the law of
South Australia.
There is no substance in this point. Self-evidently, the law referred to was "of the State". The subsection was merely describing the laws to be so characterised.
The words "of the State" were part of the description. They were not a geographical limitation. This basis for distinguishing the legislation dealt with in Chisholm and the legislation under consideration here, fails.
 
The Court should follow the Victorian Appeal
Division
This leaves the most substantial question. It concerns the effect in this
State of the holding of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Wilson versus Nattras (above). That decision, in turn, reversed the earlier, contrary, decision at first instance. See Wilson versus Nattras [(1994) 19 MVR 23 .]
Even if this Court were inclined for itself to treat the provisions in s of the Victorian Act as procedural (inviting the same result as occurred in
Chisholm), what is it to make of the fact that the highest court in Victoria has ruled that the provisions (or the most important and relevant of them) are substantive and have the effect of abolishing the cause of action at common law for negligence arising out of the circumstances of a transport accident
Victoria, substituting in its place statutory rights as defined in the Act?
Let there be no doubt that this is what the holding of the Victorian
Appeal Division provides. The Division, predecessor to the Court of Appeal of
Victoria, was constituted for the appeal by Brooking, Ashley and Hedigan JJ.
The appeal concerned injuries suffered by Mr and Mrs Wilson at Yahl in South
Australia, allegedly as a result of the negligence of Mr Nattras. The proceedings were brought in the Supreme Court of Victoria. Process was served on Mr Nattras in South Australia pursuant to the Service and Execution of
Process Act 1901 (Cth). He contested that the cause of action could be sued upon in Victoria, asserting that the first rule in
Phillips versus Eyre, as modified in McKain, was not satisfied. In short, he asserted that the claim by
Mr and Mrs Wilson arose out of circumstances "of such a character that if it had occurred within the territory of the forum a cause of action would (not) have arisen entitling the plaintiff to enforce against the defendant a civil liability of the kind which the plaintiff claims to enforce". This submission took the Victorian courts to an analysis of "the kind" of cause of action which the Wilsons would have been entitled to enforce in Victoria. The Appeal
Division held that such "kind" of action was limited to a statutory claim under the Victorian Act.
The common law entitlement to damages had been abolished. Section 93 had substituted various statutory entitlements, subject to statutory procedures. The governing provisions of <case> were not to be seen as procedural - preserving the old common law action and simply requiring certain procedures to be followed for its enforcement. It was substantive.
Such is clearly the opinion of Ashley
J, who wrote the leading judgment.
At 20, his Honour said: "What, then, is the effect of <case>-(4)? ... Section 93(1) is the central provision. It is framed in terms of "recover(y) of damages in any proceedings." It precludes recovery "except in accordance with this section". That verbiage might be said to support a conclusion that any previously existing right of action continues, there being no more than inhibitions upon what may, be recovered But an analysis of the section shows, in my opinion, that sub-section (1) addresses subject matters of quite different kinds. Unless sub-ss (2), (4) or (8) is satisfied, no damages at all are to be recoverable. ... Once this structure of <case> is understood, the proper construction of sub-ss (1), (2) and (4) appears to me to be that, subject to the condition or contingency being established, the common law right of action previously enjoyed by persons injured in transport accidents in this State is extinguished... " .
Hedigan J expressed substantial agreement with the reasons of Ashley J: "In my opinion the effect of <case> is contingently to extinguish the right to recover common law damages for personal injuries in Victoria in respect of a transport accident, wherever occurring. I am of this view notwithstanding that the language of sub-s (1) is to prohibit the recovery of damages rather than the bringing of such a proceeding. It seems likely that the language in sub-s (1) was adopted because of the later parts of <case>, which imposed caps and restrictions on various heads of common law damage and make provisions for claw-backs and costs. ... Once one of these criteria are fulfilled, the contingently extinguished right to bring common law proceedings springs into life, the only limitation apparently being the restriction on damages dealt with by <case>.
The tortious liability is substantively the same as the pre-Act common law right; the damages limitations do not alter the substantive right ...
It seems to me that the lineage of the liability, that is whether it arises under common law, statute or Order in Council ought not to dominate the matter."
Although his Honour's reasoning is not entirely plain, it appears that he supported the view of Ashley J that <case> had abolished common law damages but then, by its own force, subsequently revived them in defined cases.
Brooking J reached his conclusion by a different route. He held himself bound to apply the characterisation determined by the Victorian Parliament.
But he went on (at 4): "Ashley J (whose approach is adopted by Hedigan J) would dispose of these appeals by the application of the rule in Phillips v
Eyre, ... as reformulated... in McKain ... In Ashley J's opinion the claims of the respondents cannot be said to arise out of the circumstances of such a character that, if they had occurred within the territory of the forum, a cause of action would have arisen entitling the respondents to enforce against the appellants a civil liability of the kind which the respondents claim to enforce. If I were to apply the reformulated rule in
Phillips versus Eyre I would reach the same conclusion as his
Honour..."
The result is that, in the Victorian Appeal Division, a unanimous opinion is expressed (by two judges as part of their holding and by one obiter), that s 93 of the Victorian Act had introduced substantive changes to the law of
Victoria. It had relevantly abolished the entitlement to sue in that State for common law damages except as the Act later and contingently provided. If that holding is followed by this Court, its application of the McKain test will put the present plaintiff out of court. This is because his claim arises: "by the law of the place in which the wrong occurred the circumstances of the occurrence (do not) give rise to a civil liability of the kind which the plaintiff claims to enforce ".
The plaintiff urged this Court not to follow the Victorian decision: 
The duty of a New South Wales court is to apply
New South Wales law, as
Chisholm demonstrates. It is to classify the laws of other jurisdictions for
McKain purposes according to its own estimate. It must not forfeit that classification any more to judicial than to legislative pronouncements. It retains the obligation of classification to itself; 
Wilson versus Nattras was, so it was said, incompatible with the approach of the High Court in Stevens versus Head (above). The duty of this Court was to follow
Stevens and not Wilson. Close attention might be paid to Wilson.
But if it were shown to be wrong, it would not be followed; 
Only one in the Victorian court (Ashley J) clearly held that the common law right had been extinguished by <case>. Hedigan J appeared to hold that it was contingently extinguished only (suggesting that it contingently persisted). Brooking J, in his approach, did not have to decide the question; and 
On their face, the statutory provisions in <case> were procedural properly classified and not substantive. But procedural law was reserved to the forum.
As in Chisholm, it would not bind a New South Wales court.
I acknowledge that these arguments have some force. There is an undesirable tension between Wilson versus Nattras and Stevens. Respectfully, I have difficulty in appreciating the explanation in Stevens (at 459) as to why [s 79](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s79.html) of the [Motor Accidents Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) of this State is to be classified as procedural and thus inapplicable to an assessment of damages in an action brought in a Queensland court by a plaintiff injured in this State. I am bound by Stevens. It is my duty to apply its holding. Nevertheless, I have concluded that, although not bound by Wilson versus Nattras, this Court should apply its holding. My reasons for so concluding are: 
There is no doubt that all of the judges in Wilson had before them the correct legal principle. Each of them considered Stevens. Each proceeded to apply it. There was no oversight of the applicable principle; 
The classification of statutory provisions as procedural or substantive in character, and the determination of whether they abolish or modify pre-existing liability so that "civil liability of the kind" which a plaintiff claims to enforce in the forum no longer exists, are inherently contentious judicial tasks. So much can be seen in the conflicting opinions of judges in this series of cases. In such circumstances. this Court should have a proper modesty about substituting its opinion on the classification of statutory provisions for that reached on a Victorian statute by the highest court of
Victoria; 
The Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Victoria is in a co-ordinate position in the Australian courts hierarchy to this Court. It is embarrassing to ask this Court, in effect, to hold that, in a determination of the meaning and effect of a Victorian Act, the highest court of Victoria erred. Any such determination should be made not by this Court, but by the High Court of
Australia; 
In a nation which is increasingly integrated in social, economic and individual dealings, the achievement of consistent legal decisions about statutory requirements is an important goal. This was acknowledged by the High
Court in Australian Securities Commission versus Marlborough Gold Mines Limited <case>; [(1993) 177 CLR 485], 492. That was a decision dealing with the context of the application of federal or uniform legislation. But the same approach would seem to apply with equal force in the giving of meaning to a State statute which arises in another State and upon which the highest court of the State in question has pronounced its opinion. Of course, judicial duty forbids unquestioning endorsement of the decision of others unless those others have the power of reversal. Each court of coordinate jurisdiction retains its own judgment. It will not be bound by an interpretation which it considers "plainly wrong". See e.g. Fernando and Anor versus Commissioner of Police and Anor, [(1995) 36 NSWLR 567 (CA)], 83ff. But the imperatives of consistent court decisions upon Australian legislation having relevance to other Australian jurisdictions are strong. See R versus Abbrederis <case>; [(1984) 53 ALR 568 (VFC)], Young CJ, with whom King J agreed, said, at 576: "We are not, of course, technically bound to apply the same principles with reference to a decision of the Full Court of another State, but if it be desirable, as I believe it is, that
State courts should give a consistent meaning to a Commonwealth statute, I think we should in such a case treat a decision of the Full
Court of another State which is directly in point in the same way as we would treat a decision of our own Court."
In some ways, there are even stronger reasons for deferring to the construction given by a Full Court of a State to the legislation of its own
State Parliament, where that becomes relevant in another jurisdiction of
Australia. This is because it is easy to overlook applicable considerations in the understanding of local legislation. I would therefore accept Young CJ's approach and apply it to the present instance. It is important to emphasise that this does not involve the forfeiture by this Court of its own responsibilities to apply the law of New South Wales in its own forum. The
Court does that. But, in performing that function, it takes fully into account the decision of the Victorian Appeal Division as to the character of the provisions of the Victorian Act.
It is also important to emphasise that the decision to give <case>, (2) and (3) of the Victoria Act effect in New South Wales as substantive provisions of the law rests not on the assertion contained in <case>(40). That subsection never purported to do more than to declare what the true character of the provisions of the section was "for the avoidance of doubt". The decision of this Court will rest not upon that subsection but upon the analysis and holding of the Victorian Appeal Division. Until Wilson versus Nattras, or the principle in it, is reversed by the High Court or by legislation, it should be accepted and followed in the application of the law of this State.
 .
Submissions were received on the effect in New South Wales of the purported retrospective application of <case>(40). Having regard to the way in which I would resolve the case outside the operation of that subsection, I do not feel obliged to respond to such arguments.
 
Answers to issues for decision
I agree to the answers to the questions referred as proposed by Clarke
JA.
 
Conclusions and orders
I part with this case with the respectful repetition of my opinion that most of the difficulties presented by it (and by other cases in the series) could have been avoided by the application of <case> of the Australian [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), properly understood. Acceptance of a holding of the Appeal
Division of the Supreme Court of Victoria on the meaning of a Victorian
Act is inherent in the giving of full faith and credit to the judicial proceedings of every State. For that matter, acceptance of a provision such as <case>(40) of the Victorian Act is within the giving of full faith and credit to the laws and public Acts of every
State. The solemn determination by a court in New
South Wales that it would ignore or not apply the holding of a Full Court of another
State, or a statutory provision of the Parliament of another State, involves the application of a principle of private international law expressed in an earlier century, in another country, in different circumstances and for purposes quite different from the rational, integrated application of the law in the Australian Commonwealth. It is time that our legal system threw off the shackles of the earlier jurisprudence and developed an approach which was more in keeping with the realities of the operation of law in the Australian nation. Section 118 provides the means for doing so.
The orders which I propose are: 
Return the proceeding in Thompson v Hill to the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court with the answers to the issues as stated above; 
Return the proceeding in Clark versus Fowler to the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court; and 
Order that the costs of the proceedings in the Court of Appeal be costs in each of the proceedings so referred.
JUDGE2
CLARKE JA These two matters were listed before the Court for hearing at the same time but the parties agreed that the Court should focus on the case of
Thompson versus Hill and that its decision in that case would be determinative also in the case of Clark versus Fowler. I will, accordingly, address my remarks only to the first of those two matters.
Paul Charles Thompson (the plaintiff) filed a statement of claim in the
Supreme Court claiming damages and incidental relief against Craig Edward Hill (the defendant). In that statement of claim he alleged that he had received injuries at about 9pm on 8 November 1992 when he, as a pedestrian in
Racecourse Road, Flemington in the State of Victoria, was struck by a motor vehicle driven by the defendant. He alleged that he was, at all relevant times, a resident of New South Wales and that the defendant was, at all relevant times, the owner and driver of a Victorian registered motor vehicle.
No defence appears to have been filed in answer to this statement of claim but the proceedings came, in some unexplained way, before Dowd J sitting in the
Common Law Division. For the purposes of whatever application Dowd J was considering the parties agreed the following facts: 
Date of accident - 8 May ; 
At the time of the accident the plaintiff was a pedestrian; 
At the time of the accident the defendant was the driver of Victorian registered vehicle AZW-056; 
The accident occurred in Racecourse Road, Flemington, in the State of
Victoria; 
At the time of the accident the defendant was a resident of the State of
Victoria; 
The defendant concedes for the purposes of this application only that at the time of the accident the plaintiff was a resident of New South Wales;' 
At the time of the accident the plaintiff was employed in New South
Wales and since the accident has worked in New South Wales; 
Subsequent to the accident the plaintiff received treatment in the State of New South Wales; 
The plaintiff submitted a claim form with the Transport Accident
Commission of Victoria on 9 December 1992; 
The Transport Accident Commission has not made a determination under [s (2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/taa1986204/s93.html) and (3) of the [Transport Accident Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/taa1986204/); 
The Transport Accident Commission has not issued any certificate in writing consenting to the bringing of these proceedings pursuant to [s 93(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/taa1986204/s93.html); 
No application pursuant to [s 93(4)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/taa1986204/s93.html) for leave to bring proceedings has been made by the plaintiff; 
The relevant legislation in Victoria declaring the matters contained in [s 93](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/taa1986204/s93.html) of the [Transport Accident Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/taa1986204/) to be substantial and not procedural, and to take effect retrospectively, commencing on 1 January 1987, was assented to on 29 November ; and 
Proceedings were commenced by the plaintiff in the Supreme Court of New
South Wales on 29 September 1994.
 .
The parties also agreed the issues which were to be decided by Dowd J in the application then before him and they were as follows: 
Is Section 93 of the Transport Accidents Act 1986 (hereinafter called 'the Act') substantive or procedural? 
Alternatively, are some provisions of Section 93 of the Act substantive? ie. Section 93(1), (2), (3), (4), (7)(c), (10). 
In respect of Section (2) as amended by Section 40 of the [Transport
Accident (General Amendment) Act 1994](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/taaa1994339/) (I have understood this statement to refer to <case>(20) introduced by <case> of the Transport Act);
Does it have the effect of making Section 93 the substantive law of
Victoria?
If so, does it have that effect in the context of the choice of law rules applicable in New South Wales?
If the answers to (a) and (b) are in the affirmative, does it have retrospective effect in New
South Wales? 
Are the substantive rights of the parties governed by the law of the forum or alternatively the law of the place where the accident occurred, given that the proceedings are for the recovery of damages in respect of damage suffered by the plaintiff in New South Wales caused by a tort committed in
Victoria?
When the proceedings came before Dowd J the parties apparently persuaded him that it was desirable, in the interests of saving time and costs, to remit the issues to the Court of Appeal. Accordingly, his
Honour, relevantly, made the following orders: 
The agreed issues to be determined dated 27 March 1995 be determined as a separate issue in these proceedings pursuant to Pt 31 r 2 of the Supreme
Court Rules. 
These proceedings be removed into the Court of
Appeal pursuant to Pt 12 r 2 of the Supreme Court Rules. (This order is not entirely clear. I have, however, assumed that it was only part of the proceedings (ie the separate issues) which were removed into this Court.)
The consequence of these orders was that the proceedings came on for hearing before this Court. Might I at the outset express my wholehearted concurrence with the
President's expressions of disquiet at the procedure adopted. There are many difficulties with it, as the President has pointed out, not the least being that there has been no formal definition of the issues actually joined between the parties such as occurs where a defence, in which the defendant defines the bases upon which he contends that the plaintiff should fail, is filed. Like the President
I will put that matter to one side and endeavour to provide answers to the agreed questions.
That is not, however, a simple task for it seems to me that the questions reflect, or may reflect, a misconception of the appropriate principles of law decided by the High Court. In these circumstances I think it important to begin my discussion with reference to some basic principles and the law as it was before the trilogy of cases around which the argument in this case has focused.
Where a plaintiff sues in a New South Wales court to recover damages for a tort committed outside the State three questions may arise: 
Does the New
South Wales Court have jurisdiction to try the case? 
If the Court has jurisdiction are the proceedings justiciable in a New
South Wales court? This question involves the application of the Common Law principles of the conflict of laws (as modified by Statute) applying in New
South Wales. 
If the Court has jurisdiction and the proceedings are justiciable in the court what law should it apply in resolving the issues between the parties?
The question of jurisdiction is quite distinct from that of justiciability and depends upon whether there is jurisdiction in a New South Wales court either according to the New South Wales common law (e.g.
the presence of the defendant in New South Wales) or by any statutory extension of common law principles (eg SCR Pt 10 r1A). The question of jurisdiction does not, however, arise in the present proceedings and can at once be disregarded.
The question of justiciability depends upon whether, according to the conflict of law rules applied in this State, the court will entertain the action.
This question is often described as the threshold question and I will use that description in the rest of this judgment. The third question assumes that the court has decided that it has jurisdiction and that the proceedings are justiciable in the court but enquires by what law the proceedings are to be tried in the court. The distinction between the second and third questions is important but its significance may not have been appreciated by those who drafted the issues to be decided in this case.
Prior to the decision in Breavington versus Godleman <case>; [(1988) 169 CLR 41], the first of the trilogy, the legal principles to be applied by courts in
Australia in deciding the threshold question were relatively clear, although the question whether the controversial decision in Machado versus Fontes [(1897) 2
QB 231] Mason J said, at 49: "The accepted rule is that an action in tort will lie in one state for a wrong committed in another if the wrong is of such a character that it would have been actionable in the State in which the action is brought; and it is not justifiable by the law of the State where it was done."
His Honour went on to point out that although there was a vigorous debate as to whether the rule was merely a 'threshold' rule or whether it also operated as a choice of law rule the balance of Australian authority favoured the threshold view.
A clear expression of authority accepting that view is to be found in the decision of this Court in Kolsky versus Main Nickless Limited (1970) 72 SR 437, at , where it is said: "... that, once reference to Victorian law has fulfilled its purpose in this case of enabling it to be decided whether this action is well founded in the Supreme Court of this State, it is no longer relevant. It further follows, in our opinion ... that from that point on this action must be tried and determined in accordance with the law of this State." (See also Hartley versus Venn, 10 FLR 151, at l55; Walker versus WA Pickles pty Ltd [1980 2 NSWLR 281], at 289.)
I should pause at this stage to observe that unless the recent decisions of the High Court have denied, or doubted, the correctness of that rule then, subject to any relevant New South Wales statute, it should be accepted with the consequence that once the threshold question has been answered the law of
Victoria ceases to have relevance in the resolution of the plaintiffs claim.
That is a question to which I will return.
It is the law relating to the threshold question which has arisen for consideration in the trilogy of cases. In Breavington the question at issue was whether defences under <case> of the Motor Accidents (Compensation)
Act 1979 of the Northern Territory, which excluded the right of a person injured in a motor vehicle accident to recover damages for loss of earnings or for diminished, or destroyed, earning capacity, could be pleaded in an action in the Victorian Supreme Court.
The judges, for various reasons, all held that they could. Mason CJ on the ground that the law of the place of the tort should, absent displacing circumstances, apply. Wilson, and Gaudron JJ in a joint judgment and Deane J in a separate judgment, focused primarily on <case> of the Australian [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). Toohey J favoured the flexible approach apparent in the speech of Lord Wilberforce in Chaplin versus Boys [(1971) AC 356], at , 392. The remaining two justices, Brennan and Dawson J expressed a traditional test based substantially on Phillips versus Eyre [(1870) LR 6 QB 1.] It is this opinion, or more accurately, that of Brennan J, which has prevailed, having been accepted by a clear majority in McKain v R W Miller and Co (SA)
Pty Limited <case>; [(1991) 174 CLR 1], at 39. Accordingly, whatever view I entertain about the persuasive judgment of the Chief Justice in Breavington, or the effect of [s 118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s118.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/), I am bound to apply that test. It reads: "A plaintiff may sue in the forum to enforce a liability in respect of a wrong occurring outside the territory of the forum if - the claim arises out of circumstances of such a character that, if they had occurred within the territory of the forum, a cause of action would have arisen entitling the plaintiff to enforce against the defendant a civil liability of the kind which the plaintiff claims to enforce; and by the law of the place in which the wrong occurred, the circumstances of the occurrence gave rise to a civil liability of the kind which the plaintiff claims to enforce."
The court was there concerned with the effect that a South Australian
Statute, which the court held to be procedural in nature, had on proceedings in New South Wales in respect of a tort committed in South Australia. In the judgment the majority referred to a concession that "the substantive law of the place of the wrong is imported into the forum" (p 40) and observed that the concession "was consistent with the second part of the conflict of law rules as we have stated them".
That statement and earlier observations in the judgment discussing the conflict of law principles which should be applied by the law of the forum suggests to me that the discussion in the majority judgment was focusing on the second limb of the principle and not the different question as to which laws should be applied by the forum once it decided the proceedings were justiciable there.
 .
That brings me to the third case Stevens versus Head <case>; [(1993) 176 CLR 433] where the same four justices referred to the now binding statement of the relevant governing principles (p 453) and went on to say: "This formulation focuses attention on the kind of civil liability which a plaintiff is seeking to enforce. A plaintiff's cause of action under the law of the forum thus depends in part upon an affirmative answer to the question whether, by the lex loci, the relevant facts gave and continue to give rise to a civil liability of the kind which the plaintiff seeks to enforce."
Furthermore, in determining whether that is so a distinction is to be drawn between substantive and procedural laws. Thus the majority said: "In determining whether, by the lex loci, the relevant facts gave rise to a civil liability of the kind which the plaintiff seeks to enforce, the courts of the forum distinguish between substantive and procedural laws. Procedure is governed exclusively by the laws of the forum, but the substantive laws of the place of the tort determine whether, by those laws there exists a civil liability of the kind which the plaintiff seeks to enforce." (p456)
Although there are, as it seems to me, some less than satisfactory aspects in the division between substantive and procedural laws, and the tests used to distinguish the two (as recourse to the judgments of Mason CJ and
Deane J demonstrate), the above statement of the law must be taken as settled.
The relevant question then is, for purposes of the second limb of the
McKain formula, whether s 93 of the Act or sub-sections of it are substantive or procedural. The broad principles by which the distinction is, relevantly, to be drawn, also appear in Stephen, at p457, in the following passage: "... a line of authority (eg McKain, pp4O-43) which distinguished between a statute of limitation which does no more than cut off resort to the courts for the enforcement of a claim and a statute which extinguishes civil liability and destroys a cause of action. The former is classified as a procedural law, the latter as substantive,...
 ...

A similar distinction has been drawn between a law which denies a remedy in respect of a particular head of damage in negligence (a substantive law) and a law which affects the quantification of damages in respect of a particular head of damage (a procedural law)."
In dealing with ss 79(1) and 79(4) of the
New South Wales [Motor Accidents
Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) the majority judgment went on to say: "Does [s 79(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s79.html) or [s 79(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s79.html) partially extinguish or make contingent the common law cause of action for damages for non-economic loss? If so, these provisions would be classified as substantive."
Having regard to the discussion which preceded these words I would regard the phrase 'partially extinguish' as raising the question whether the law in question destroyed a previously existing right to recover a particular head of damage. I do not find the meaning of the alternative phrase 'make contingent' as clear. The question is not unimportant in the present circumstances for, on one view, s93 introduces contingent elements into the cause of action for negligence arising out of a transport accident. Later in the judgment (p 459) the majority adverted to the question saying: "In other words sub-ss and (4) assume that a common law liability exists but direct the court not to exercise its jurisdiction to award damages when it finds that the circumstances prescribed by those respective provisions exist.
The liability is not truly contingent, but the right to enforce the liability is. The provisions of sub-ss (1) and (4) of [s 79](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s79.html) operate in much the same way as a statute of limitations, that is to say, by acknowledging the cause of action but barring its enforcement."
While the distinction is simple to express it is not so clear from the judgment itself what is meant by a contingent cause of action. The earlier reference to Southgate versus Waterford [(1990) 21 NSWLR 427] (a case not concerned with choice of law rules) is illustrative only of a contingent right to enforce a remedy.
More insight is to be obtained from the judgment in McKain (at 43) in which there was a discussion of the difference between a statute which bars stale claims and a statute which creates a right of limited duration so that after the expiry of the time prescribed the right ceases to exist for any purpose.
In the latter example, which the majority said constituted a substantive law, it is easy to comprehend that the right is conditional or contingent in the sense that it must be exercised within a prescribed time.
Where, therefore a new right, or cause of action, is created by statute which continues to exist only for a limited period it can be said that, as a
matter of substantive law, the right is contingent. Equally, as in Stevens, there are cases where it is simple to understand that it is only the remedy which is barred. But there are other circumstances - the present is one - in which the characterisation is not a simple matter.
It is with these observations in mind that I turn to <case>, the relevant parts of, which read: "93.
Actions for damages 
A person shall not recover any damages in any proceedings in respect of the injury or death of a person as a result of a transport accident occurring on or after the commencement of section 34 except in accordance with this section.

A person who is injured as a result of a transport accident may recover damages in respect of the injury if - the Commission has determined the degree of impairment of the person under section 46A, [47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s47.html)(7) or [47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s47.html)(7A); and the injury is a serious injury.

If - under section 46A, [47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s47.html)(7) or [47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s47.html)(7A), the Commission has determined the degree of impairment of a person who is injured as a result of a transport accident; and the degree so determined is 30 per centum or more - the injury is deemed to be a serious injury within the meaning of this section.

If - under section 46A, [47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s47.html)(7) or [47](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/s47.html)(7A), the Commission has determined the degree of impairment of a person who is injured as a result of a transport accident; and the degree so determined is less than 30 per centum - the person may not bring proceedings for the recovery of damages in respect of the injury unless- the Commission- is satisfied that the injury is a serious injury; and issues to the person a certificate in writing consenting to the bringing of the proceedings; or a court, on the application of the person, gives leave to bring the proceedings.
 ...

A court must not give leave under sub-section (4)(d) unless it is satisfied that the injury is a serious injury.

A court must not, in proceedings in accordance with sub-sections (2), (3) and (4), award to a person in respect of an injury - pecuniary loss damages - if the total pecuniary loss damages assessed, before any reduction in respect of the person's responsibility for the injury, is less than $20 000; or in excess of $450 000; or pain and suffering damages- if the total pain and suffering damages assessed, before any reduction in respect of the person's responsibility for the injury, is less than $20 000; or in excess of $200 000; or damages of any other kind.
 ...

Damages awarded to a person under this section shall not include damages in respect of - in the case of an award of pecuniary loss damages under sub-section (7), any pecuniary loss suffered before the entitlement of the person to compensation under this Act was reviewed under section 46; or any loss suffered or that may be suffered as a result of the incurring of costs or expenses of a kind referred to in section ; or the value of services of a domestic nature or services relating to nursing and attendance - which have been or are to be provided by another person to the person in whose favour the award is made; and for which the person in whose favour the award is made has not paid and is not and will not be liable to pay.
 ...
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act, for the purposes of the [Limitation of Actions Act 1958](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/loaa1958226/), the cause of action in respect of an injury arises on the day of the transport accident or on the day on which the injury first manifests itself.

For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that all the provisions of this section contain matters that are substantive law and are not procedural in nature."
By <case>.4 of the [Transport Accident (General Amendment) Act 1994](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/taaa1994339/) (which added (19) and (20) it was provided that sub-s 20 was deemed to have come into operation on 1 January 1987.
The section (s 93) is expressed in terms denying a party a right to damages in respect of injury or death as a result of a transport accident except in accordance with the regime appearing in the following subsections.
That regime requires both that the injury be a serious one and that the plaintiff secure the determination of the Transport Accident Commission established under the [Transport Accident Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/taa1986204/) before any action can be maintained. In substance, the effect of [ss 93(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/taa1986204/s93.html) and (2) is to deny a person, who is injured in a transport accident, the right to sue a third party for damages for negligence unless at least two conditions are fulfilled - the
Commission has determined the degree of impairment and the injury is a serious one. These observations are, I think, consistent with the analysis of Brooking
J in his judgment in Wilson versus Nattras (Supreme Court of Victoria,
Appeal
Division, 16 May 1995, unreported) that: "Section 93 of the Act does not create a new cause of action.
Plainly s (2) is not to be read literally as imposing absolute liability on some unspecified person or persons to a person injured as a result of a transport accident provided only that the Commission has determined the degree of impairment and 'the injury is a serious injury'. The section presupposes that the pre-existing law determines what causes of action - negligence being in practice by far the most important - may afford a remedy in damages in respect of the injury or death of a person as a result of a transport accident ...

The result of <case> is that an action for damages in respect of the injury or death of a person as a result of a transport accident cannot be brought unless two conditions are satisfied.
The first is that the
Commission has determined the degree of impairment under <case>, <case> or <case>(7A). The second is that injury is a serious injury, not in the sense that it is in fact a serious injury, but in the sense that one of the following three requirements is satisfied:
That the Commission has under <case>, <case> or <case>(7A) determined the degree of impairment as 30 per cent or more;
That the Commission is satisfied that the injury is a serious injury and has by written certificate consented to the bringing of the proceedings;
That the court, being satisfied that the injury is a serious injury, has given leave to bring the proceedings (which leave must be given if the Court is satisfied that the injury is a serious injury:
Humphries versus Poljak <case>; [(1992) 2 VR 129], at 138, per
Crockett and Southall JJ)."
The section is, both in form and in substance, different in essential respects from <case> of the New South Wales [Motor Accidents Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/) which was held in Stevens to be procedural. Sub-sections 93(1), (2) and (4) do not, as later sub-sections do, affect the quantification of damages either generally or in respect of a particular head of damage. They operate to deny a person a right to recover in respect of any damages in the relevant circumstances unless the two conditions have been satisfied. A person has, for instance, no right to go to court in Victoria seeking damages for personal injuries received in a transport accident unless the Commission has determined the degree of impairment and the injury is a serious one in the sense earlier discussed.
There are three possible ways of viewing these sub-sections:  (a) They do no more than deny a remedy.
They make the cause of action contingent upon the occurrence of the specified events;
They extinguish the cause of action of negligence (or nuisance) in respect of a transport accident and provide a new cause of action which includes the elements of the common law cause of action and the additional elements required by the section. This proposition could be expressed slightly differently by saying that while it does not extinguish the relevant common law cause of action it adds new elements without which the cause of action is not complete.
Upon the first view the subsections are procedural, upon either of the other two they are substantive. The difficulty with the view that its effect is to destroy the relevant common law causes of action and to substitute one which is derived partially from statute and partially from the common law is that <case> provides, albeit for a limited purpose, that the cause of action arises at a time before any approach has been made to the commission. The alternative is that it should be regarded as a statutory provision which truly does make contingent the common law cause of action for damages in respect of a transport accident. It is contingent at the outset upon a determination by the Commission so that unless that has occurred a person is not entitled to recover any damages (s 93(1)).
It would, in my opinion, be an unacceptable extension of the concept of a procedural law to allow it to embrace a statutory provision which disentitles a person from recovering damages for personal injury received in a transport accident except upon satisfaction of conditions expressed in the statute. I would, therefore, conclude that, whichever of the latter two views are correct, ss 93(1), (2) and (4) are substantive laws. This conclusion accords with that of Ashley J in Wilson where his Honour said: "Once the structure of <case> is understood the proper construction of sub-ss (1), (2) and (4) appears to me to be that, subject to a condition or contingency being established, the common law right of action previously enjoyed by persons injured in a transport accident in this State is extinguished - except to the extent that such a person might fall within sub-section 18(b) or (c)." (See also Hedingan J at p 4)
Sub-sections (7), (13) and (15) are different. They are clearly procedural. Sub-section (10) should be read with (1), and (4) and would appear to be substantive to the extent that it extinguishes the right to damages in the circumstances set out in that sub-section.
Earlier I referred to the question whether the substantive law of the place of the tort is imported into the law of the forum solely for the purposes of the second rule in McKain or whether it is imported for all purposes. The question arises in this case because of the form of the questions submitted. I earlier indicated that prior to Breavington the weight of authority supported the view that the substantive law of the place of the tort was imported only for the more limited purpose. In Breavington,
Mason CJ accorded primacy in all respects to the substantive law of the place of the tort and, obviously, that view involved the importation of the law of the place of the tort into the forum for the determination of the issues which arose there. His opinion on the question with which I am now dealing was supported by Brennan J who said (at p 110): "The two conditions are not merely the criteria of the forum's jurisdiction; they state the substantive law which governs a plaintiff's right to recover a judgment in respect of an extra territorial wrong." 
This view was not, however, shared by Dawson and Toohey JJ (see pp 142-3, 145 and -1).
Because, however, there was not a clear majority in favour of the application of the Phillips versus Eyre rule it seems to me that Breavington can not be considered to have over-ruled the principle supported by the balance of authority. McKain stands in a different situation for there was in that case a clear majority in favour of the modified Phillips versus Eyre rule but on the question
I am considering there was no express statement of opinion. That is, perhaps, not surprising for there had previously been divided views among the majority on the question. On the other hand the discussion concerning the concession, to which I earlier made reference, evidences the judges' concentration on the second limb of the Phillips versus Eyre rule.
In Stevens Mason CJ specifically referred (at p 440) to the prevailing view before Breavington and the Australian cases which supported it but said that it was at odds with express statements of members of the court in
Breavington. He also considered that a proper understanding of the principles enunciated by the majority in McKain made it clear that they also rejected it.
His Honour referred to pages in the authorised report of Breavington to support his proposition. For my [part I](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/maa1988166/index.html#p1) am not so sure that the passages in the judgments of Dawson and Toohey JJ do in fact support what the Chief Justice said. I prefer the views of Justice Nygh in his "Conflict of Laws in
Australia" (6th Ed) at p 343 who expressed the view that there was a division of opinion in Breavington and went on to say (p 343): "The remarks made by the majority in McKain versus R W Miller and Co 
Pty Ltd and Stevens versus Head make it clear that in its view the cause of action arises under the law of the forum. It rejects therefore the vested rights proposition that the plaintiff's right of action is given by the law of the place of wrong. But this cause of action under the law of the forum 'depends in part upon an affirmative answer to the question, whether, by the lex loci, the relevant facts gave and continue to give rise to a civil liability of the kind which the plaintiff seeks to enforce'. This sounds more like a 'threshold requirement' than a choice of law rule, and it may be that the current Australian position is similar to that stated by Lord
Wilberforce in Boys versus Chaplin: 'I accept what I believe to be the orthodox judicial view that the first part of the rule is laying down, not a test of jurisdiction, but what we now call a rule of choice of law: is saying in effect, that actions on foreign torts are brought in English courts in accordance with
English law'."
What is more important is that apart from the statement by Mason CJ in
Stevens, it was not suggested by the majority either in McKain or Stevens that the earlier held view concerning the limited effect of the substantive law of the place of the tort was wrong. In those circumstances I see no justification for departing from the rule accepted in this Court in Pickles and Kolsky and holding that the substantive law of the place of the tort is relevant only for the purposes of the consideration of the second limb in the rule in McKain.
I find support for that view in the recently published decision of Dawson
J in Gardner versus Wallace (High
Court of Australia, 10 November 1995, unreported). His Honour was dealing with an application which concerned [s 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/colpa1993301/s5.html) of the [Choice of Law (Limitation Periods) Act 1993](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/colpa1993301/) (Vict) which read: "If the substantive law of another place being another State, a Territory or New Zealand, is to govern a claim before a court of this State, a limitation law of that place is to be regarded as part of that substantive law and applied accordingly by the court."
His Honour observed in relation to that section: "The effect of <case> of the Choice of Law (Limitations [Periods)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/pa100/) is not entirely clear. Its wording may be based upon the misconception that in McKain versus R W Miller and Co (SA) Pty
Limited this Court decided that in an action in one State in respect of a tort committed in another State, the substantive law to be applied is that of the State where the tort was committed, that is to say, the lex loci delicti. McKain versus R W
Miller and
Co (SA) Pty Ltd did not decide that. It decided that, provided two conditions were met, an action could be maintained in a State other than that in which the tort occurred and that the law, procedural and substantive, to be applied in resolving the action was the law of the State in which the action was heard, that is to say, the law of the forum."
His Honour then went on to refer to the concession which I have earlier set out and said that it was "erroneous if it meant any more than that the substantive law of the place of the wrong is imported for the purpose of determining whether the second condition for the assumption of jurisdiction is satisfied".
His Honour's statement accords with the view which I have expressed that there is nothing in
McKain inconsistent with the principle accepted in Kolsky and the other cases I mentioned.
I appreciate that upon this view of the law there will be opportunities for forum shopping which is generally, but not universally, considered undesirable. While
I support the generally held view on that question I am constrained by the High Court to apply the McKain modification of Phillips v
Eyre and by decisions of the High Court (Koop versus Bebb <case>; [(1951) 84 CLR 629], per Windeyer J at 42) and the previously mentioned decisions of this court to apply the law of the forum except in the consideration of the second limb of the McKain rule.
I would answer the questions posed (which I will repeat for convenience) as follows: 
Is [s 93](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/taa1986204/s93.html) of the [Transport Accident Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/taa1986204/) (hereinafter called 'the
Act') substantive or procedural?
Answer: Partly substantive and partly procedural. 
Alternatively, are some of the provisions of <case> substantive, i.e. ss (1), (2), (3), (4), (7c), (10)?
Answer: Section 93(1), (2), (4), (7c) and (10) are substantive. 
In respect of <case>(20), as amended by <case> of the [Transport Accident (General Amendment) Act 1994](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/taaa1994339/) -
Does it have the effect of making <case> the substantive law of Victoria?
If so, does it have that effect in the context of choice of law rules applicable in New South Wales?
If the answers to (a) and (b) are in the affirmative does it have retrospective effect in New South Wales?
Answer: It is not necessary to answer this question. 
Are the substantive rights of the parties governed by the law of the forum or, alternatively the law of the place where the accident occurred given that the proceedings are for the recovery of damages in respect of damage suffered by the plaintiff in New South Wales caused by a tort committed in
Victoria.
Answer: The substantive rights of the parties are governed by the law of the forum except to the extent that the substantive law of the place of the tort is determinative in respect of the second limb of the test in McKain.
I would like, however, to make one final observation. My perception is that there is a large degree of confusion as to the role of the substantive law of the place of the tort. This confusion is, perhaps, demonstrated in the statute to which Dawson J referred and the complementary statutes in other
States and also in the argument and the questions submitted in this case. It can, in my respectful opinion, be put to rest satisfactorily only in the High
Court in the light of the statement made by Mason CJ in Stevens (at p 440).
I agree with the orders proposed by the President.
JUDGE3
COLE JA The factual circumstances giving rise to this matter coming before the Court, the questions referred by the primary judge, and the relevant legislation are set forth in the judgment of Kirby P.
In my opinion the answers to the questions referred emerge from the following considerations: 
The private international law rules applicable in Australia are those enunciated by the majority in McKain versus R W Miller and Co. (South Australia)
Pty Limited ((1) <case>; [(1991) 174 CLR 1] at 39): "A plaintiff may sue in the forum to enforce a liability in respect of a wrong occurring outside the territory of the forum if-
The claim arises out of circumstances of such a character that, if they had occurred within the territory of the forum, a cause of action would have arisen entitling the plaintiff to enforce against the defendant a civil liability of the kind which the plaintiff claims to enforce; and
By the law of the place in which the wrong occurred, the circumstances of the occurence gave rise to a civil liability of the kind which the plaintiff claim to enforce."
In explanation, Brennan,
Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJA said: "The causes of action arising in the several law areas of the
Commonwealth are dependant on, and incorporate as an element, the existence of a civil liability under the lex loci delicti.
Once any of the causes of action merges in a judgment, the original civil liability must be taken to be merged in the judgment and to have been extinguished.

It is no longer available to found any other cause of action.
It follows that the civil liability to which the law of the place in which the wrong occurred gave rise must be a continuing liability; if that civil liability be extinguished, the cause of action conferred by the common law of the forum is extinguished too. That qualification or refinement is of importance in the present case, for the same principle must apply whether the civil liability under the lex loci is extinguished by merger in a judgment, by accord and satisfaction, or by statute." ((2) <case>; [(1991) 174 CLR 1] at 39-40 The view of the majority was restated in Stevens versus Head ((3) <case>; [(1993) 176
CLR 433] at 456 "In determining whether, by the lex loci, the relevant facts give rise to a civil liability of the kind which the plaintiff seeks to enforce, the courts of the forum distinguish between substantive and procedural laws. Procedure is governed exclusively by the laws of the forum, but the substantive laws of the place of the tort, determine whether, by those laws, there exists a civil liability of the kind which the plaintiff seeks to enforce." A substantive law is one which extinguishes, in whole or in part, or makes contingent the common law cause of action for damages. ((4) Stevens versus Head <case>;  <case>; [(1993) 176 CLR 433] at 459.) 
The [Transport Accident Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/taa1986204/) (Vic) is a substantive, not a procedural law. It was so held by Ashley and Hedington JJ in Wilson versus Nattras. ((6) 
May 1995 per Hedington J page 4, Ashley J p.21). 
Further, the Victorian Parliament has, by the [Transport Accident (General
Amendment) Act 1994](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/taaa1994339/) made clear its intention that since the commencement of the [Transport Accident Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/taa1986204/) on 1 January 1987, the provisions of [s.93](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/taa1986204/s93.html) were intended to be and have now been declared to be part of the substantive law of
Victoria. 
This Court should adopt the construction of the Victorian Statute determined by the Full Court of Victoria unless it can be said, with due respect, that the construction is "plainly wrong". ((7) Fernando and Anor v
Commissioner of Police and Anor (Unreported), Court of Appeal , 29 March .)
It is unnecessary for this Court to express a view upon the decision in
Wilson other than to say that it is clearly not "plainly wrong". Accordingly, in New South Wales that decision, as well as the expressed legislative intention of the Victorian Parliament, is to be respected and applied. That follows from both general principle and [s. 118](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/s118.html) of the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/). 
It follows, in my view, that as the substantive right to claim damages in present circumstances has been abolished in Victoria, the claim in the present circumstances is not maintainable in New South Wales.
I would answer the questions referred as follows: . Is [s.93](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/taa1986204/s93.html) of the [Transport Accident Act 1986](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consolact/taa1986204/) (hereinafter called the "Act") substantive or procedural?
Answer: Substantive. 
Alternatively, are some of the provisions s.93 of the Act substantive, i.e. s. 93(1), (2), (3), (4), (7)(c), (10)?
Answer: See 1 above. Does not arise. 
In respect of s.93(2), as amended by s.40 of the [Transport Accident (General Amendment) Act 1994](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/taaa1994339/):
Does it have the effect of making s.93 the substantive law of Victoria?
