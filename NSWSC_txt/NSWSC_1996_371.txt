HPM INDUSTRIES PTY LTD versus Robert GRAHAM /96 
WEDNESDAY 17 JULY 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
YOUNG J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: This is the return of an injunction which was granted by the Chief Judge last week ex parte. The "facts" available to the court at this stage have flowed entirely from the investigations made on behalf of the plaintiff. The defendant has tendered a medical certificate to show that his ability to give evidence to date and up to about 6 August 1996 is affected by his serious ill health. Accordingly, when I am referring to "facts" these are the best material available at this stage, but it may well be that when things are investigated further the facts will be stronger or weaker in favour of either the plaintiff or the defendant.

At the moment the material shows that it is more likely than not that the defendant, as an employee or agent of the plaintiff, received large sums of cash for which he did not account to the plaintiff. The plaintiff says that the amount over a seven-year period may be close to a million dollars. The plaintiff says that its investigations, which have resulted in property searches, show that the defendant is entitled to an interest in a number of parcels of real estate and the plaintiff hopes in due course to be able to trace its money through to at least some of those parcels of real estate.

Mr McVay of counsel for the defendant points out that some of the parcels of real estate were acquired before 1989, which at present is the earliest date that the plaintiff can demonstrate some of its money found its way into the defendant's care, so that he says there can be no tracing so far as those properties are concerned. Mr Harrison SC, who appeared with Mr Waugh for the plaintiff, points out that with respect to at least some of those pre-1989 properties it would appear that considerable moneys have been paid to mortgagees, which moneys may well have come from the funds diverted from the plaintiff.

The Chief Judge last week granted a Mareva injunction to freeze all the defendant's property, but excepted $500 per week living expenses and $20,000 costs of the present proceedings. The Chief Judge also ordered, with leave to the defendant to apply to vary or discharge an order, that the defendant deliver an affidavit to the plaintiff's solicitor setting out all his assets together with details of names of secured creditors and the like.

The argument today by the defendant is that even on an interlocutory basis these orders are too wide. First, it is put that the order requiring the delivery of the affidavit offends against the privilege which was recognised by the High Court in Reid versus Howard <case>; [(1995) 184 CLR 1.] Secondly, it is put that in any event the Mareva order is too wide because it goes much further than any tracing exercise could follow property.

It is necessary to reconsider the law in this area following the decision of the House of Lords in Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale versus Islington LBC <case>; [[1996] 2 All ER 961]; [[1996] 2 WLR 802.] In that case the House of Lords overruled Sinclair versus Brougham [[1914] AC 398] and made it clear that cases where the problem can be dealt with by the Common Law action for money had and received, or as Lord Goff put it at page 977, a personal claim at Common Law for unjust enrichment should be dealt with on that ground and that there is no call for invoking equitable doctrines of constructive trust, unless there is some inadequacy of the Common Law remedy. The obvious example of an inadequacy would be the Quistclose Trust situation ([1970] AC 567) and there could well be others, such as the situation where there is a question as to the defendant's insolvency.

This is not the time to consider whether this court should follow the House of
Lords: that is better left to a situation where it can be fully argued. The decision was only given on 22 May this year and there has been inadequate time to digest it fully, but it would seem to me that the probabilities are that this court should follow that decision. It has the beneficial effect that small claims for employees defrauding their employers by diverting money can be dealt with in the Local Court or the District Court at much less expense, but still preserves to this court equitable remedies where the Common Law remedies are inadequate. For present purposes I will follow the House of Lords decision in the Westdeutsche case.

On that analysis the present claim is one either for Common Law damages for conversion or more probably for money had and received, both Common Law claims. There is only room for Equity to come into the picture if the remedy of damages is insufficient. This may be where there is some fear in the Mareva situation that before the judgment can be obtained there will be a likelihood that the defendant will dispose of his assets. Mr McVay says that there is no demonstrated possibility in the instant case. However, Gleeson CJ in
Patterson versus BTR Engineering (Aust) Ltd [(1989) 18 NSWLR 319], 326 endorsed the proposition that if the only material before the court is that a person has fraudulently misappropriated a large sum of money which is still under his control, then in the absence of further material: "It is reasonable to infer that he is not the sort of person who would, unless restrained, preserve his assets intact so that they might be available to his judgment creditor." 
Meagher JA and Rogers AJA agreed and, indeed, this was the decision that Giles
J had made at first instance.

On that line of thinking there is sufficient here to continue the Mareva injunction which the Chief Judge had made, at least until the time when the defendant is in a position, if he chooses, to give evidence. The medical evidence suggests that this will not be before 6 August 1996.

Accordingly, in my view, on the usual undertaking the Mareva order made by the
Chief Judge should be extended to, say, 13 August 1996.

There is one modification which should be made in the light of subsequent events. It would seem that some of the properties which are registered in the defendant's name are subject to current mortgages and it is to the interest of everybody that proper mortgage payments of principal and interest due under those mortgages be made by the defendant pending the hearing of these proceedings. I will stand the matter over for short minutes to be brought in later in the day, but it would seem to me that those short minutes should add a further proviso to order 1 that if either the plaintiff's solicitor or the court is satisfied that it is proper to pay principal or interest on mortgages on properties in the defendant's name, then that can also be excepted from the operation of the Mareva order.

The second problem is whether the defendant should be compelled to deliver an affidavit as to his assets in the light of the distinct possibility that he will be charged with some criminal offence, and that if he provides an affidavit that may be used against him in subsequent proceedings. Before the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) the High
Court ruled in Reid versus Howard that the privilege against incrimination was sufficiently strong to overrule any considerations of justice that might flow the other way by having an alleged criminal fraudster disclose what his properties were so that they could be frozen pending the hearing of the proceedings.

Mr Harrison SC says that that case has now really lost its effect because of [s 128](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), at least so far as this State is concerned. The Commonwealth [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) is in exactly the same terms so that provided the section applies a person is completely protected from prosecution based on the evidence which he or she has given to a court if a certificate is given under the section. Not only is the disclosure protected but also no information, document or thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person having given evidence can be used against the person concerned, except in a perjury prosecution. I first had some doubts as to whether [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) did apply to a situation where a court was considering whether a party should be required to give evidence by disclosing his or her assets. In the ultimate I have been persuaded that it does apply. Clause 7 of the dictionary referred to in [s 3](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s3.html) of the Act makes it clear that a reference in the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) to a "witness" includes a reference to a party giving evidence. Accordingly, a party is covered by [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) If the court compels a party to give evidence, such as by swearing an affidavit as to his or her assets, then the person has the protection now given by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) of the Act against incriminating himself or herself. That extends to providing material which could lead to investigators uncovering transactions. The precise scope of protection against material discovered by further investigation appears to me at this stage to be a little fuzzy, but it is quite clear that the principle extends that far (see Reid versus Howard at p ; Sorby versus The Commonwealth <case>; [(1983) 152 CLR 281], especially at 291-2; Attorney General (Vic) versus Riach <case>; [[1978] VR 301] and the discussion in McNicol on The Law of
Privilege LBC Sydney 1992 pp 273 and following.) However, subs(7) of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) seems to protect a person, if a certificate is given, from the consequence of information, documents or things being found even as an indirect consequence of the affidavit.

There may be some problems which cannot be envisaged at this stage which will appear once detailed attention is given to preparing an affidavit. It seems to me, however, that at this stage one can deal with both the public interest in preventing people from incriminating themselves and the public interest in preventing fraudsters spiriting away property by indicating that I would be prepared to give a certificate under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) in respect of the affidavit. The affidavit should then be prepared and instead of being delivered to the plaintiff's solicitor, as the existing order envisages, it should be handed up to me on the next occasion. I would then give a certificate under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) and attach a copy of the affidavit to it, which would mean that there would be no prosecution of the defendant as a result of that evidence or anything that was found from it.

I think, however, that for more abundant caution paragraph (e) of the present order 2 should be deleted so that there is no reference to any security for any debt. I do this for two reasons. The first is that paras (a) to (d) seem to me to be in the area of merely stating assets and that the mere statement of assets has less likelihood of incriminating than has the statement of securities and, secondly, because it is unfortunate if the situation is allowed to develop that the defendant can make such a detailed affidavit that his affidavit can be a shield from any successful prosecution by preventing the police from investigating matters which they otherwise would have investigated.

Indeed, the position is not entirely satisfactory because in order to make sure the defendant's rights under Reid versus Howard are protected I have virtually got to promise an indemnity in advance by promising my certificate under [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html)
That promise means that once I see the affidavit I will not be able to make any adjustment that would protect the rights of the prosecution authorities to investigate the alleged crime.

Unfortunately, I will not be the duty judge in the week of 13 August 1996. I think that I should have the matter returnable before me at 9.30am on that day, or alternatively 15 August, whichever is more convenient to counsel. I would then take the affidavit, issue the certificate and if the matter is to be debated then refer it to the duty judge at 10am.

However, it seems to me that these orders should also be brought to the attention of the prosecuting authorities, as it may be they would wish to be heard as to whether it would be better to have no affidavit which might impede the investigation of criminal proceedings. If they take that view then I think that all copies of the affidavit may have to be destroyed. They are not parties to the proceedings, but I think in the public interest I should hear them as amicus curiae.

Accordingly, I will make orders in accordance with the short minutes which will be prepared during the day to carry out what I have just said and stand the matter over to my list on 13 August 1996 at 9.30 am.

Tuesday 27 August 1996 
THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES EQUITY DIVISION 
YOUNG J 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: I gave reasons for judgment in this matter on 17 July 1996 ex tempore. Those reasons were to the effect that the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) enabled a way to be found around the dilemma that presented itself to the Courts in Reid versus Howard <case>; [(1995) 184 CLR 1.] I made some directions in an endeavour to have an affidavit prepared by the defendant that would give the plaintiff sufficient information and suggested a procedure whereby the defendant could be protected against the adverse aspects mentioned in Reid versus Howard. Essentially this was to require the defendant to go into the witness box before me on the next occasion, require him to tender his affidavit in evidence and then give a certificate under [s 128](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). I said at the end of the judgment that the order should be brought to the attention of the prosecuting authorities as it may well be that they would wish to be heard as to whether such an affidavit would impede the investigation of criminal proceedings. 
The matter came back into my list on 13 August 1996. I was then told that the matter had been settled as between the plaintiff and the defendant and that I should vacate all further orders. I did this.

In response to my invitation, Mr G R Barr QC as his Honour then was, appeared for the Attorney General and made submissions amicus curiae.

Mr Barr QC did not find any difficulty with the procedure which was outlined in my earlier judgment. He submitted that the shield given to a person under [s (7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) should precisely cover the demand of the Court that is made under [s (5).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html)
There was some discussion as to what was meant by a "witness" within the meaning of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) and as to whether that term should encompass not only a person in the witness box, but also a person who is required to give evidence by affidavit. There is a definition of "witness" in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s7.html) of [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/index.html#p2) of the Dictionary to the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), but that definition is completely useless for present purposes.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) seems to envisage the situation where a person is in the position of objecting to giving particular evidence. The section also is set in the background of the witness giving evidence with the Court having certain discretions as to whether in all the circumstances it should require the witness to answer a possibly incriminating question. This scenario suggests that it is applicable only where the witness is in Court.

Accordingly, what should happen is that in the situation referred to in my earlier judgment, the witness should be asked in Court for oral evidence. Time will be saved if the oral evidence is reduced to a statement which can just be handed up and made an exhibit, but the witness will need to actually get into the witness box. I agree with all the submissions that were made to me in this regard. It does not, however, alter the prime thrust of the judgment that I gave on 17 July 1996.

As to inspection, Mr Barr QC submitted that the Court must inspect the affidavit or list of assets before permitting the plaintiff to see the list, and then only permitting the plaintiff's lawyers to see the list on appropriate conditions to be set by the Court. I agree that this is the appropriate procedure.

Mr Barr QC did, however, submit that the list of assets should also contain a statement of securities. I was reluctant to do this in my earlier judgment because I thought that such a list would cause problems of the type referred to in Reid versus Howard even if a certificate were given. However, Mr Barr QC submits that this is not so and that the shield under [s (7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s128.html) would be sufficient to cover this situation as well. Accordingly, it is appropriate to assist a plaintiff in a case such as the present by requiring not only the list of assets be provided but also a list of securities.

I do not need to make any other orders in these proceedings because they have been settled between the parties. However, I thought that it was appropriate to give these further reasons as the likelihood is that my earlier reasons will be widely circulated throughout the profession.
