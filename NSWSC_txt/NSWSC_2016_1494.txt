EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT (REVISED)
The situation is that the witness known as Witness M gave evidence in the joint trial in which the jury is presently deliberating. In the course of preliminary hearings leading up to that trial, an application was made that evidence that Witness M had given at the Crime Commission be produced to the Court and to the parties: ss 45(4) and (5) Crime Commission Act 2012. The first of these was not published and remains confidential: R versus Qaumi & Ors (No 7) <case> The second was published in a form whereby part of the judgement was public (although presently subject to a non-publication order until the end of a related trial) and the balance in the form of a confidential annexure which is not to be published and is to be secured in a sealed envelope: see R versus Qaumi & Ors (No 11) <case> There was a thrid judgment relating the the Crime Commission's application for non-publication orders: R versus Qaumi & Ors (No 19) <case>
The second of those judgments set out the application made on behalf of Farhad Qaumi seeking "any evidence given before the Commission: * (a) Relating to the murder of Joseph Antoun; * (b) Relating to the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy; * (c) Relating to the conspiracy to murder Mahmoud Hamzy; or, * (d) Any evidence given by Mahmoud Hamzy."
Once the trials were separated in accordance with R versus Qaumi & Ors (No 3) <case>, the application for the documents under (a) - that is, evidence "relating to the murder of Joseph Antoun" - was abandoned by Farhad Qaumi, as was, indeed, the application for evidence given by Mohammed Hamzy.
Witness M gave evidence before the Crime Commission and a certificate under <case> of the Crime Commission Act 2012 was given and the material was produced to the Court. Thereafter, the evidence was made available to the accused: see R versus Qaumi & Ors (No 11) at [33]. However, it was in a redacted form whereby any reference to evidence given by Witness M as to the murder of Joseph Antoun was edited out or redacted.
In the judgment, I said: "The Antoun trial is to proceed after the trial relating to the murder of
Mahmoud Hamzy and other related shooting offences and whether the accused brings a separate application in relation to the Antoun trial will be a matter for him."
The accused Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi have now brought an application by notice of motion with supporting affidavits for material or evidence given at the Crime Commission by one particular witness, that is Witness M, relating to the Antoun murder.
Mr McIlwaine from the Crown Solicitor's Office appears on behalf of the New South Wales Crime Commission and indicates that he does not object to a certificate being granted under <case>, the result of which would be that the material would be produced to the Court and there would then possibly be an argument as to whether or not the evidence would be released to the accused based on the criteria in <case> which were discussed in the judgment R versus Qaumi & Ors (No 11).
I note that the reasoning in R versus Qaumi & Ors (No 11), because of the nature of the material, was largely contained in a confidential annexure to the judgment, which has not and will not be provided to the accused and is generally unavailable to the public. But it seems clear enough to me that Witness M will be an important, if not critical, witness in the forthcoming proceedings and that evidence Witness M gave on the subject of the Antoun murder and any knowledge Witness M may or may not have had of it clearly has potential to be relevant to the manner in which the accused conduct their defence.
I propose to grant a certificate pursuant to <case> of the Crime Commission Act in the form helpfully provided by Mr McIlwaine and I do so.
Accordingly, pursuant to <case> of the Crime Commission Act 2012 ('the Act'), the Court certifies that: 
Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi have been charged with an offence before a court of this State; and the Court considers that it may be desirable in the interests of justice that particular evidence given before the New South Wales Crime Commission ('the Commission') in relation to which the Commission has given a direction under <case> of the Act - namely, evidence given by Witness M - be made available to the legal practitioners representing Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz
Qaumi and to the prosecutor.
