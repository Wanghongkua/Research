PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with Stein JA. 
SHELLER JA: I agree with Stein JA. 
STEIN JA: On 5 June 1997 Neilson CCJ made an award in favour of the applicant/worker Mrs Julie Southern, the respondent to the appeal. The substance of the award was threefold: lump sum compensation under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) of the [Workers Compensation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/) (the
Act) with respect to a finding of 20% permanent impairment of the applicant's back; lump sum compensation with respect to a finding of 10% loss of use of the applicant's right leg at or above the knee; and lump sum compensation of $16,100 under <case> of the Act with respect to pain and suffering, being 25% of the maximum payable.

Only the first of these awards is under challenge in the appeal.

The application before the Compensation Court sought an award of 15% with respect to the back, 5% with regard to the right lower limb and 20% under s .

During the course of the hearing, counsel for the applicant worker was granted leave to amend the application as follows: a) to claim 25% with respect to the back; b) to claim 15% with respect to the leg; and c) to claim 25% under <case>.

The granting of the amendment is not challenged in the appeal, although the circumstances surrounding it are relied upon to support the contention of the appellant that it was denied a fair trial. It should be mentioned that the appeal is confined to an error of law.

To understand the thrust of the submissions made on behalf of the appellant it is necessary to briefly trace the course of the hearing before the
Compensation Court.

The respondent gave evidence and clearly impressed his Honour as a credible witness whom he accepted. At the conclusion of her evidence, a number of medical reports were tendered in her case. Counsel for the appellant (the respondent to the application) then tendered a number of medical reports. His
Honour indicated that he would adjourn to his chambers to read the medical reports. Counsel were then invited to attend upon the judge in his chambers.
After entering it is maintained that his Honour said `You realise it would be an error of law for me to award more than the pleadings'. Nothing more was said about the case.

When the hearing resumed in court the judge said: ` Mr Harrington [counsel for the worker], I have read the medical evidence. Do you wish to amend?'
Whereupon an application was made to amend, which was objected to by counsel for the appellant, Mr Gracie. During the course of his submission, he indicated to his Honour that his client was prejudiced in that he had not sought to call oral evidence from the medical practitioners. His Honour intimated that he would allow the appellant to reopen and call medical witnesses. Dr James Bodel was then called. His Honour asked the doctor a number of questions, some of which were objected to by Mr Gracie. At the conclusion of his evidence, counsel for the worker tendered a further medical report from Dr Roth (one of the appellant's medical practitioners).

Counsel then addressed and Judge Neilson delivered an ex tempore judgment. In doing so his Honour said: 
At the conclusion of the evidence I drew to Mr Harrington's attention my view that it would be an error of law for me to award more than was claimed in the
Application for Determination. Mr Harrington accordingly sought leave and was granted leave to amend to claim greater lump sums. I allowed these amendments over Mr Gracie's objection...(AB 81R-T) and 
I formed the view on listening to Mrs Southern that the extent of the impairment of her back and the extent of the pain and suffering may have been greater than those originally claimed. Mr Harrington appears to have foreseen that by making the amendments that he did. Suffice it to say that I allowed Mr
Gracie every opportunity he wished to adduce any further evidence after the amendments had been made. He did, by calling Dr Bodel. However, it is clear from what I have already said that Dr Bodel made concessions which might have entitled Mr Harrington, if he wished to, to claim a one-third impairment of the back and a 20 per cent loss of efficient use of the applicant's right leg at or above the knee. This merely shows that medical practitioners do often not take into account relevant legal considerations or relevant considerations that the court must take into account.(AB 82 D-J) 
In relation to the back injury his Honour assessed the proportion of a most extreme case as in the ratio of 1:5, i.e. 20%.

The evidence before the Compensation Court on the back injury included the opinion of Dr Robert Smith of a 15% permanent impairment (AB 44L), the worker's own evidence, Dr Bodel's assessment of 8% (AB 27K) and Dr Roth's assessment of 10% (AB 75P).

His Honour was obliged to make an assessment under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s66.html) of the Act by reference to the Table referred to in the section. The Table follows [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/s73.html) and opposite `permanent impairment of the back' appears `0 - 60', i.e. the range of percentage of the maximum amount payable is between 0% and 60%. An interpretation note follows the Table. Paragraph (a) states: 
Where a range of percentages is provided by this Table, the maximum percentage is payable only in a most extreme case and the percentage payable in any other case shall be reasonably proportionate to that maximum percentage having regard to the severity of the matter. The amount payable in any particular case shall, in default of agreement, be determined in accordance with this Act by the Compensation Court.

For my [part
I](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/wca1987255/index.html#p1) can see no reason why the judge could not, within his discretion, have found that the respondent's back was permanently impaired to the extent of 20%.
Although Dr Bodel's assessment was 8%, there were aspects of his oral evidence which could support his Honour's conclusion. For example, Dr Bodel did not doubt the worker's complaints, which he believed were not unreasonable. He accepted that damage to the L5/S1 disc (which the worker had injured) affects the whole function of the back and that, while the loss of function `may well be' one-third, `it could be a lot less' (AB 35).

It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that his Honour misused or misinterpreted Dr Bodel's evidence in an effort to justify the amendment which he had invited. Further, that his assessment of 20% in relation to the back was not properly open on the evidence.

I can see no error in the judge's assessment, nor any procedural irregularity in his approach. I see no room for any suggestion of pre-judgment, nor misuse of his advantage in order to bolster his Honour's view on the amendment. The finding was clearly open on the evidence. Moreover, it was a finding of fact.
I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
