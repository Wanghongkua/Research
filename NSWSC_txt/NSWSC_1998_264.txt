MONTE PASCHI AUSTRALIA LTD versus EDWARD LUIGI MURA /97 July 1998 
Hidden J 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales Common Law Division 
JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: In 1994 and 1995 the plaintiff (respondent) made a number of loans to the defendant (appellant) which were secured by a mortgage over his property at Drummoyne. On 4 March 1997, the plaintiff issued a statement of claim against the defendant alleging default in repayments and seeking an order for possession of the property. Of the procedural developments thereafter, it is sufficient to say that the defendant filed a cross-claim on March 1998 and an amended defence on 22 April 1998. On 17 March 1998, the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by Master
Malpass in a judgment of 24 April 1998. This is an appeal by the defendant against that decision.

By the defence and cross-claim, the defendant alleges: that the plaintiff was itself in breach of the terms of the mortgage "by continually overstating the balance due under the mortgage and by not accepting payment offered by the defendant of the correct balance .... In order to discharge the mortgage"; that, in any event, the mortgage "is no longer in force as it has been superseded by a further contract".

The defendant claims that, on a number of occasions, the plaintiff charged penalty interest to which it was not entitled. The plaintiff acknowledged its error in respect of some of this interest, but the amount is still in dispute.
However, it is common ground that the defendant has made no payments at all since the end of June 1996. Master Malpass noted in his reasons that the defendant had made offers to pay the principal and interest due under the mortgage, except for the disputed penalty interest, but these offers were not accepted. However, there has been no tender of any sum and the Master observed that it is "beyond argument" that the defendant has been in default under the mortgage since at least June 1996.

The defendant claims that the plaintiff is in breach of the mortgage through its overstatement of the balance due, and its refusal of his offer to pay the principal and interest. As to the latter, he relies upon a clause of the mortgage which provides that the mortgagor "shall be entitled to repay the whole of the principal moneys hereby secured at any time upon payment of interest to the day of payment ... " However, that clause comes into play when payment is tendered, not when it is offered. The defendant asserted that, because of its own breach of the mortgage, the plaintiff could not rely upon his continued failure to make repayments. For that proposition he cited
Rushcutters Investments versus Grellman (C of A, unreported, 17 June 1987),
Horrobin versus ANZ Banking Group (C of A, unreported, 16 September 1996) per
Sheller JA, and Citibank Savings Limited versus Stergiou (ACT Sup Ct (Higgins J), unreported, 28 August 1997), but nothing in any of those decisions lends support to such a proposition.

As to the claim that the mortgage has been superseded by a new agreement, the defendant alleges that in or about May 1997, after the statement of claim was issued, agreement was reached with the plaintiff to refinance the loans.
Before me, but not before the Master, he relied upon an affidavit of 14 June of Mr Clem Marcocci, formerly the plaintiff's State Manager. I allowed him to read that affidavit, subject to the objection of counsel for the plaintiff that it was fresh evidence and no special grounds had been shown to admit it in the appeal: <case> of the [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consolact/sca183/). In my view, that objection is well founded. There was an earlier affidavit of Mr Marcocci, filed by the defendant, before the Master. It dealt with the matter of the disputed claims for penalty interest, but was silent about any arrangement to refinance the loans. The later affidavit asserts that such an arrangement was made. No explanation for the omission of that matter from the earlier affidavit has been forthcoming. Indeed, nothing has been put before me which could amount to special grounds, within the meaning of <case>, for the admission of further evidence.

In any event, the later affidavit takes the matter no further. Its assertion that an agreement for refinancing the loans was made is entirely unsupported by the correspondence between the defendant and the plaintiff at the relevant time, upon which the defendant himself relies. At most, that correspondence shows that a refinancing proposal was discussed, but was never finalised. In addition, it appears from the later correspondence that the plaintiff itself offered to consider the restructure of the existing loans upon receiving certain information from the defendant. The defendant supplied some of that information, but pursued the matter no further. There is simply no material capable of supporting his assertion that a refinancing agreement was concluded.

I allowed the defendant to argue two other matters subject to the objection of counsel for the plaintiff that they had not been argued before the Master, and were not the subject of any ground set out in the notice of appeal. For this purpose I received into evidence some documents, again subject to objection.

The first of these matters is that a notice to the defendant under [s (2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) of the [Real Property Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/), was not served on the defendant until after the statement of claim was filed. The notice is dated 20 February 1997, but it was forwarded to the defendant in an envelope postmarked 10 March, six days after the statement of claim was filed.
The defendant relies upon a clause of the mortgage which permits the plaintiff, upon default by the defendant, to "exercise all or any of the powers of a mortgagee", under the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) or the [Conveyancing Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca1919141/), "subject however to compliance with any requirements of the said Acts in respect of the exercise of such powers." 
That notice, however, is a prelude to the exercise of a power of sale: [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s58.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/). As counsel for the plaintiff correctly observed, it is not necessary for such a notice to be given before the institution of proceedings for possession (even though the sale of the property usually follows an order for possession). This argument is without substance.

The second matter relates to a notice dated 29 November 1996 from the plaintiff to the defendant under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cfca1984260/s7.html) of the [Credit (Home Finance Contracts) Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cfca1984260/).
[Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cfca1984260/s7.html) of that Act provides that a "credit provider under a home finance contract" may not institute proceedings, or exercise any right, under a contract as a result of default until after the expiration of one month after service of a notice in the prescribed form. It is common ground that, for present purposes, the plaintiff is a "credit provider under a home finance contract". That being so, service of a notice in accordance with the section is a condition precedent to the institution of court proceedings: Graham versus Aluma Lite Pty
Limited [(1996) 39 NSWLR 58.] 
The notice begins: "After one month from the time this Notice is received Monte Paschi Australia
Limited intends to take legal action or exercise a right under a home finance contract against Eddie Luigi Mura." 
On the second page of the notice, the following appears: "Nature of Intended Legal Action or Exercise of Right: 
Sale of mortgaged property at 16 Formosa Street, Drummoyne 2047." 
The defendant's argument is that the notice fails to comply with the section because it specifies the exercise of a power of sale, rather than the institution of legal proceedings, as the action contemplated. However, as counsel for the plaintiff pointed out, obtaining possession of the property is a necessary prerequisite to any sale, and the form of the notice could not have caused any prejudice to the defendant. This argument also is without substance.

It is unnecessary formally to rule upon the objection by counsel for the plaintiff to the tender of the notices under [s (2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/s57.html) of the [Real Property
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/rpa1900178/) and s (1) of the [Credit (Home Finance Contracts)
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cfca1984260/), and the arguments founded upon them. It is sufficient to say that the fact that these matters were not argued before the Master, and were not the subject of a ground of appeal, has not been explained. They are, in any event, without merit.

The final matter argued is the subject of a ground of appeal, although it seems that it was not raised until after Master Malpass had given his reasons (but before judgment was entered). There is evidence that, at the time proceedings for possession were instituted, the Drummoyne property was occupied by the defendant and another person, Ms Amanda Clarke. Judgment in accordance with the Master's reasons was entered on 30 April 1998, but it was not until 7 May 1998 that Ms Clarke was served with the originating process in accordance with [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cfca1984260/index.html#p7) r 8 of the rules. Counsel for the plaintiff explained that this was done for more abundant caution, and did not amount to a concession that Ms Clarke was not a member of the defendant's family: cf National Commercial Banking Corp of Australia Ltd versus MRM Holdings Pty Ltd (1983) 3 BPR 9339.

The defendant's complaint is that the Master gave no weight to the fact that, at the time his reasons were delivered, the plaintiff had not complied with [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cfca1984260/index.html#p7) r 8. However, as counsel for the plaintiff correctly submitted, this misconceives the scheme of the rules. Failure to comply with [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cfca1984260/index.html#p7) r 8 may bear upon the issue of a writ of possession: [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cfca1984260/index.html#p42) r 4(4), but it does not inhibit judgment for possession unless that judgment is given in the absence of the defendant: [Pt ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/cfca1984260/index.html#p40) r 11. This, of course, is not such a case. Yet again, the argument is without merit.

I am well aware of the principles governing summary judgment as, clearly, was
Master Malpass. Those principles and their rationale were summarised by Kirby
P (as his Honour then was) in Rushcutters Investments (supra). I can detect no error in the Master's reasons, nor am I persuaded that for any other reason summary judgment should not be entered.

The appeal is dismissed with costs.
