JOHN MARSDEN v

AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED 
ACN 000 145 246 
CORRS CHAMBERS WESTGARTH (On Subpoena) 
JUDGMENT (T1384: Evidence on Corrs application re subpoena) HIS HONOUR: On 28 April, (T1247.5), I ordered that such evidence as is relevant in the application by Corrs in respect of the subpoena will be evidence in the substantive application by the defendant to amend.
 For reasons which I will later publish, I do not propose to vary that position. The evidence which is for the disposition of the application by
Corrs will be limited to the evidence I have heard in support of it, that is evidence by affidavit and oral evidence in that application.
 In relation to the resolution of that application, there was a suggestion that I might make the order and give reasons later. I have absolutely no intention of taking that course and I will reserve my decision. That will be decided when I decide it and it will be handed down as soon as possible.
