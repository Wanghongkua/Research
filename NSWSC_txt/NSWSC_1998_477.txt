ROSS versus WGE PTY LIMITED 
The respondent was engaged by the common law occupier of Cockatoo Island
Dockyard to carry out renovations in a pump room at the dockyard. The appellant was employed by the respondent to take part in this work. The appellant sued the respondent in negligence and in the alternative for breach of statutory duty under the Factories, [Shops and Industries Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) (the Act) to recover damages for injuries he suffered in the course of his employment as a result of falling into a partially covered manhole.

During the trial, the trial Judge removed the statutory counts from the jury.
The jury returned with a verdict that the respondent was not guilty of being negligent and accordingly, the trial Judge entered judgment in favour of the respondent.

The grounds of appeal were that the trial Judge had erred in law in removing the statutory counts from the jury and that on the evidence, the verdict of the jury was perverse. The appellant sought to amend the notice of appeal when the hearing of the appeal began.

Held:
The point raised in the amended notice appeal covers the same points as raised in the notice of appeal. There is no prejudice to the respondent, therefore, the amendment should be allowed.
On the evidence, it was open to the jury not to accept the appellant's account of what happened or, if he did fall into the manhole, to decide that the respondent was not negligent.
At common law, "occupier" denoted a person who had sufficient control over the premises to impose a duty of care upon them for those who lawfully enter the premises: Wheat versus E Lacon & Co Limited <case>; [[1966] AC .]
The second part of the definition of "occupier" in s4 (1) of the 1962 Act was intended to include the common law concept of occupation.
The first part of the definition of "occupier" in s4 (1) extends the meaning of "occupier" beyond the common law concept to include persons, partnerships, associations or corporations who are employers of persons "in the factory". Its purpose is to require an employer to ensure the safety of persons the employer employs.
The trial Judge erred in taking the statutory counts from the jury. It will be a matter for the jury to determine whether the respondent was an occupier under the 1962 Act.

Per Powell JA Dissenting
The judgment of the majority gives a literal meaning to the definition of "occupier" in the 1962 Act. The present case illustrates that this is apt to produce incongruous results, which, if the language of the statute is not intractable, provides justification for a court not to apply a literal meaning to the definition: Grey versus Pearson  <case>; [(1857) 6 HLC 61], [10 ER 1216]; Broken Hill South Limited versus Commissioner of Taxation  <case>; [(1937) 56 CLR 337]; Cooper versus Brooks (Wollongong) Pty Limited versus Federal
Commissioner of Taxation <case>; [(1980-81) 147 CLR 297.]
The language of the statute is not so intractable to demand a literal construction.
The 1962 Act should be construed either: so as to hold that there was only one occupier - Cockatoo Dockyard Pty
Limited - of the island; or if some lesser construction is to be called for, so as to hold that each such company or organisation, other than Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Limited, was to be regarded as the occupiers of only that part of the island in the that company or organisation was required to carry out, or in fact carried out, work.
In this case, it does not matter which construction is adopted because it is clear that at the relevant time the respondent was not required to carry out any work, and did not in fact carry out any work, in the area where the appellant claimed to have sustained his injury.

ROSS versus WGE PTY LIMITED 
JUDGMENT 
MASON P: I agree with Sheller JA. 
SHELLER JA: 
INTRODUCTION 
The resolution of this appeal turns almost entirely upon the question whether the respondent, WGE Pty Limited, was within the definition in s4 (1) of the
Factories, [Shops and Industries Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) (the Act), the occupier of a factory in which Gregory Ross, the appellant, claimed to have been injured, because the respondent was the person or corporation employing persons in the factory. The appellant alleged that there were contraventions of ss 34 (a) and 40 (1) of the 1962 Act for which the respondent, as occupier, was liable under s70.

PROCEEDINGS 
A company, referred to as Vickers Cockatoo, which was the common law occupier of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney, engaged the respondent as a contractor to carry out renovations in a pump room at the dockyard. This involved taking out old pumps, cleaning out the area and installing new pumps.
The respondent employed the appellant to take part in doing this work.

The appellant claimed that on 21 June 1984 and in the course of his employment he was walking up stairs from the dockyard to the pump house. When he reached the top of the stairs, he started to walk on the surface and suddenly and without warning fell into a manhole which had been only partially covered. As a result of falling into the manhole he sustained severe injuries, loss and damage and continuing incapacity.

The appellant, by an amended statement of claim, sued the respondent, in negligence and in the alternative for breach of statutory duties said to have been owed to him by the respondent pursuant to ss34 (a) and 40 (1) of the 1962
Act (the statutory counts), to recover damages for injuries alleged to have been suffered by him as the result of the accident.

Patten DCJ heard the proceedings with a jury. During the trial, his Honour took the statutory counts from the jury and left only the count of negligence.
The jury answered in the negative the question did they find the respondent was negligent as a result of which the appellant suffered injury. On 15
September 1995 Judge Patten entered judgment in favour of the respondent and ordered the appellant to pay the respondent's costs other than those referable to earlier arbitration proceedings. The appellant appealed.

APPEAL 
Without objection, the appellant filed an amended notice of appeal which contained four grounds, the second and third of which were not pressed. Ground was that the trial Judge had erred in law in removing from the consideration of the jury the question of whether the respondent was in breach of s34 (a) of the 1962 Act. Ground 4 was that "[t]he verdict of the jury was perverse in that all the evidence demonstrated negligence on the part of the [respondent] giving rise to some damage, though there being no evidence to the contrary ".

When the hearing of the appeal began, the appellant sought to rely upon a further amended notice of appeal which contained a new ground 5 that the trial
Judge erred in law in removing from the consideration of the jury the question of whether the respondent was in breach of s40 (1) of the 1962 Act. The respondent objected to this ground being added at such a late stage. The appellant relied on Brisbane South Regional Health Authority versus Taylor <case>; [(1996) 186 CLR 541.] As will appear, the point raised covers the same ground as ground 1 of the notice of appeal in respect of a different section of the 1962 Act. I can see no prejudice to the respondent in the amendment and, while I deprecate a decision to amend the notice of appeal at such a late stage, in all the circumstances,
I think the amendment should be allowed.

NO NEGLIGENCE 
Ground 4, in my opinion, has no merit whatever. It was open to the jury on the evidence not to accept (i) the appellant's account of what he claimed happened to him or, (ii) if he did fall into a partially open manhole in the circumstances he described, that the respondent was negligent in failing to perform the duty of care it owed to him. Questions of fact arose as to whether or not prior to the incident the appellant had been dismissed from the employment of the respondent, and if so, whether the incident occurred while he was leaving the area of work pursuant to his dismissal. This ground of appeal fails.

STATUTORY COUNTS 
Sections 34 (a) and 40 (1) in Pt 3 of the 1962 Act provide as follows: "34. In every factory: all floors, steps, stairs, passages and gangways shall be of sound construction and properly maintained;" "40. (1) There shall so far as is reasonably practicable be provided and maintained in every factory safe means of access to every place at which any person has at any time to work." 
The 1962 Act did not specifically impose on any person the obligation to observe those provisions.

The statutory duty, breach of which the appellant relied upon as involving a correlative private right (O'Connor versus SP Bray Limited <case>; [(1937) 56 CLR 464] at 478), is to be found in s70 of the 1962 Act which provides: "Where the obligation to observe any of the provisions of this Part or any regulations thereunder which relate to factories or shops is not, by this Act, specifically imposed on any person then in the event of a contravention of any such provision in or in relation to a factory or shop the occupier of that factory or of that shop, as the case may be, shall be guilty of an offence against this Act.

Where by virtue of any provision of this Act a factory or shop is deemed not to be kept in conformity with this Part, the occupier of that factory or shop shall be guilty of an offence against this Act." 
The appellant claimed that the area where he was injured was within a factory and that the respondent was "the occupier of that factory" within the meaning of s70. The definite article before "occupier" suggests that the drafter contemplated that of any factory or shop there would be but one occupier held criminally responsible for the contravention. But this case was not argued on the basis that some other person or corporation might be liable as "the occupier".
 "Factory" is defined in s4 (1) by reference (a) to a building or place in which persons are engaged in a manufacturing process or other activities or processes mentioned or by reference (b), (c), and (d) to particular places which included a dockyard. The evidence was that the appellant, if injured as he claimed, was injured in a factory, namely a dockyard. But should it have been left to the jury to consider whether the respondent was "the occupier" of the dockyard? 
Section 4 (1) provides: "In this Act, unless the context or subject matter otherwise indicates or requires: .......
 "Occupier" means, in relation to a factory or shop, the person, partnership, association, or corporation employing persons in the factory or shop, or occupying the factory or shop, and includes any agent, manager, foreman, or other person acting or apparently acting in the general management or control of the factory or shop and the owner or person deemed to be the occupier pursuant to subsection (2)." 
JUDGE PATTEN'S REASONS 
In submissions to Judge Patten on the application to take the counts away from the jury, the appellant's counsel conceded that the respondent was not an occupier in the common law sense but claimed that the respondent was an occupier because it was an employer. Judge Patten dealt with the question on that basis and said: "However the relevant facts which might be shortly stated for the purposes of these reasons are that the defendant was engaged as a contractor to perform certain work on Cockatoo Island in and about the Sutherland dock and the plaintiff was employed by the defendant in relation to that. The evidence in the form of diagrams and photographs indicate that the dock in the area where the plaintiff said that he fell, comprises quite a large paved area comprising buildings etcetera. The evidence was that the defendant, in company with a number of other contractors, was engaged pursuant to various contracts in performing work in and about the dock. It is not being suggested that in any way the defendant was an owner or occupier of the dock in any normal sense. It is clear that the defendant would only be deemed to be an occupier for the purposes of the Factories, [Shops and Industries
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) if it fell within the extended meaning of that expression as a result of the definition in [section .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/s4.html)
As I've said at first blush there is some attraction in the argument that any person who employs somebody to work on a factory thereby has imposed upon him the obligations of the statute, however I've reached the conclusion that that is not so. It must be borne in mind that the Factories, [Shops and Industries
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) imposes penal obligations upon occupiers of a wide variety and it seems to me that for instance if the present defendant could be categorised as an occupier for the purposes of the statute, then in relation to the area about which it was performing the duties of its subcontract, it would have cast upon it the various obligations imposed upon occupiers by the statute including for instance the obligation under section 27 to [securely fence all] dangerous parts of the machinery there.

The view which I have formed is that the definition of occupier does not extend the meaning, the ordinary meaning of that expression to the extent that it encompasses subcontractors who employ persons to carry out particular tasks in premises which in the normal sense could be said to be occupied by others.
That view is supported by the statement of the text writer handed to me by Mr
Wilkins in the course of his argument and he's also supported by some English authorities, although they are not entirely to the point including the decision of the House of Lords in Smith versus Cammell, Laird and Company Limited [[1940] AC 242.] Regrettably there is no Australian authority upon the meaning of the definition of occupier in section 4 of the Factories, [Shops and
Industries
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) nor indeed any English authority on the definition in such terms but as a matter of statutory interpretation as I've indicated I have concluded that it cannot have been the intention of the legislature to impose such onerous obligations as are contained in the Factories, [Shops and Industries
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) upon an entity which had such a transitory connection with the dock as this defendant had. Accordingly I uphold Mr Wilkins' submission I will take from the jury's consideration the second [count] in the statement of claim and the consideration of the particulars relied upon in support of the [count] alleging a breach of the statute accordingly." "THE OCCUPIER" WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 70 
As a matter of language and free from any consideration of context or subject matter, "occupier" in relation to a factory is defined to mean, relevantly the person or corporation employing persons in the factory. There was evidence that the respondent fell within this definition.

The thrust of the argument for upholding the trial Judge's decision was that the respondent or other companies or persons in a similar position, if they were occupiers within the meaning of the Act, would become liable for severe criminal sanctions for failing to comply with the rigorous requirements of the
Act, including those relied on here, namely failure to ensure that all floors in the factory were of sound construction and properly maintained, and that so far as was reasonably practicable there should be provided and maintained in the factory safe means of access to every place at which any person has at any time to work. Thus it was suggested that the definition of "occupier" could not mean what, on its face, it appeared to mean.

The definition has a long lineage extending back, at least, to the definition in s2 of the [Factories and Shops Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1896196/). It is to be observed that s54 of that Act provided: "Where the occupier of a factory is charged with an offence against this Act or the regulations thereunder, he shall be entitled upon information duly laid by him to have any other person whom he charges to be the actual offender brought before the magistrate or justices at the time appointed for hearing the charge, and if after the commission of the offence has been proved, the occupier of the factory proves to the satisfaction of the magistrate or justices that he used due diligence to enforce the provisions of the Act and regulations, and that the said other person committed the offence in question without his knowledge, consent, or connivance, the said other person shall be summarily convicted of such offence, and the occupier shall be exempt from any penalty." 
See also s61 of the [Factories and Shops Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1912196/).

This section was designed, no doubt, to mollify the draconian consequences suggested to arise if "occupier" was given its full defined meaning. Under the Act, full meaning could be given to the definition without necessarily bringing about the results that are now suggested. This strengthens the argument that when the 1896 Act was passed, the definition had the meaning for which the appellant now contends. In material respects, the definition has not changed in the later legislation, but the 1962 Act has no equivalent to s54 of the 1896 Act.

At common law, liability for injury to persons or damage to chattels can arise as an incident of the occupation of the premises on which it occurred. In
Wheat versus E Lacon & Co Limited <case>; [[1966] AC ] at 577,
Lord Denning said that "occupier", when used in the common law cases on occupiers' liability for dangerous premises, was "simply a convenient word to denote a person who had a sufficient degree of control over premises to put him under a duty of care towards those who came lawfully on to the premises." 
In Turner versus Courtaulds Limited [(1937) 1 All ER 467] the owner of premises was charged as the occupier of a factory under statutory and regulatory safety provisions for failing to make an electrical switchboard dead. A Divisional Court held that the owner and not another company which was erecting new electrical equipment including an additional section to the switchboard, was the occupier. The Court was not concerned with any definition of "occupier".

Smith versus Cammell, Laird and Company Limited concerned a regulatory system which imposed upon the occupier of a factory the duty of complying with safety regulations, without defining "occupier". At 250 Viscount Maugham said that " `occupier' was intended to mean the person who runs any separate undertaking in any building and who regulates and controls the work that is done." At 256
Lord Atkin said that it was not necessary to consider "the question of separate manufacturing businesses being carried on by separate occupiers in the same building." 
No doubt the second part of the definition of "occupier" in s4 (1) of the 1962
Act, which brings in the person etc "occupying the factory or shop", was intended to embrace the common law concept of an occupier who has a degree of control over the premises; on the common law meaning of occupier see Fleming,
The Law of Torts, 9th ed, at 500. A building contractor may be the occupier of a building in the course of construction; see AMF International Limited v
Magnet Bowling Limited [[1968] 1 WLR 1028] at 1052;
Canberra Formwork Pty Limited versus Civil & Civic Limited [(1982) 41 ACTR ] at
In the particular case, including this case, it would be a matter for the jury, properly instructed, to decide whether the defendant was such an occupier. However, the appellant conceded that the respondent was not a common law occupier.

Clearly, the drafter of the legislation in 1962 was not content that the meaning of occupier be limited to the common law meaning based on control. The first part of the definition is based not on occupation or control of the factory or shop but on the employment of persons in the factory or shop. To read it down as extended only to persons who control the areas in which persons are working and are able to ensure that the Act is complied with, involves a withdrawal to the common law concept.

The first meaning of "occupier" the definition gives is the person etc employing persons in the factory. This priority suggests that the definition is a device designed to impose the primary liability for any breach of an occupier's duty in relation to a factory under the 1962 Act, so far as that breach affects an employee, upon the employer. The long title of the 1962 Act states that it was to make provisions with respect, inter alia, "to the health, safety and welfare of persons employed" in factories. The purpose and object of the Act must have been to require the employer to ensure that in any factory, in which the employer employs persons, the statutory provisions are complied with and regard must be had to that purpose or object in the interpretation of the Act; [s33](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s33.html) of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/).

The employer is not excused from liability if the statutory provisions are not complied with and a person the employer employs is injured. Whether one considers the imposition of such liability on the employer as draconian, in particular circumstances, the statutory purpose is to protect people working in the factory from injury. I do not think the purpose is to require an employer to ensure the safety of persons the employer does not employ. If the language of the definition in a given case suggests this result, the purposive interpretation would allow it to be read down to that extent; compare [s6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s6.html) of the [Interpretation
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/). But that is not the issue here.

The definition must be construed so as to give the first part, in relation to a factory, effect. It must extend the word to include persons, partnerships, associations or corporations who are not occupiers in the common law sense, but who are employers of persons "in the factory". The suggestion put by Mr
Maconachie QC, who appeared for the respondent, was that the definition extended only to the case where the employer and employee were engaged in the undertaking or industrial activity of the factory. This is to introduce a limitation which is not found in the language used. Its only recommendation is the avoidance of criminal sanctions which might otherwise appear harsh and capricious.

In Glass, McHugh and Douglas, The Liability of Employers, 2nd ed, at 150, the authors said: "The duties and obligations imposed on the occupier, by the Act, therefore, fall on the employer. It matters not whether he is the owner of the factory or a lessee or licensee. Unlike the English legislation these matters are irrelevant. Under the English legislation control of the premises and not of the work is the vital thing. In New South Wales it is the control of the work being done which constitutes the criterion." 
I respectfully agree. By contrast in Callaghan, Occupational Health and
Safety Act 1983, 2nd ed, at 15 the author said: "In the absence of any statutory definition, the occupier of the factory has been held to be the person who runs the factory, who regulates and controls the work that is done there, and who is responsible for fulfilling the obligations of factory law: Ramsay versus Mackie (1904) 7 Fraser (Ct of Sess) ; Cox versus Cutler & Sons Ltd [[1948] 2 All ER 665]; Smith v Cammel Laird & Co.

In so far as the definition covers a person `occupying the factory', it would seem that the principle established in these cases would be applicable so that a contractor engaged to install machinery in factory premises does not thereby become the occupier of the factory: Purves versus Stern [(1900) 2 Fraser ](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%281900%29%202%20Fraser%20887 "View LawCiteRecord" ); the person who, apart from the contract for the installation of the machinery, is the occupier, still remains the occupier in such cases: Turner v Courtaulds Ltd [[1937] 1 All ER 467.] 
It may, however, be argued that the definition by referring to a person `employing persons in the factory' makes the contractor an occupier at least qua his employees engaged on the contract work within the factory premises, but it seems that there are several reasons why this should not be so. The contractor's work is very often in the nature of construction work to which the Scaffolding and Lifts Act, but not this Act, purports to apply; the
Factories, [Shops and Industries
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) is simply not intended to cover the processes involved in such work: cf Bailey v
Potteries Electric Traction Co Ltd [[1931] 1 KB 385.] Again, this
Act imposes on an `occupier' duties and obligations which can effectively be discharged only by the person who runs the factory and controls and regulates the work therein; an example is seen in s27, which requires the occupier to fence all dangerous parts of the machinery in the factory. For these reasons it is submitted that the statutory definition has not included application of the principle of Turner versus Courtaulds. This view seems to be supported by the decision of the House of Lords in Smith versus Cammell Laird & Co." 
With all respect, this submission uses cases decided in England and Scotland under a safety regulation system, which included no definition of "occupier", as authority to read down the defined meaning of the word in the New South
Wales legislation. As discussed the defined meaning must have been intended to extend the meaning of "occupier" beyond the common law concept and to make the employer responsible for the safety of its employees in the factory.

While, because of its implications in terms of criminal sanctions, the matter is not free from doubt, I prefer an interpretation which is based on the unqualified language of the definition and accords with the express purpose of the legislation.

CONCLUSION 
In my opinion, the trial Judge erred in taking the statutory counts from the jury. The appeal should be allowed and the appellant should have a new trial limited to the statutory counts in his statement of claim. It will be a matter for the jury, properly instructed, to determine whether the respondent was an occupier within the meaning of s70 of the 1962 Act. I propose the following orders:
Leave to the appellant to rely upon the further amended notice of appeal filed on 12 November 1997;
Appeal allowed;
Set aside the orders of Patten DCJ made on 8 September 1995;
Set aside the judgment of Patten DCJ of 15 September 1995 and the order that the plaintiff pay the defendant's costs other than those referable to the arbitration proceedings;
The appellant to have a new trial limited to his claim based on breaches of ss34 (a) and 40 (1) of the Factories [Shops and Industries Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/);
That the costs of the first trial be in the discretion of the Judge hearing the new trial;
The respondent to pay the appellant's costs of the appeal but to have a certificate under the [Suitors Fund Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sfa1951176/), if so qualified.

POWELL JA: I have had the opportunity of reading in draft the judgment which has been prepared by Sheller JA with which Judgment Mason P agrees. 
As Sheller JA has recorded at the commencement of his Judgment, the principal question for determination by this Court on this appeal is whether, upon the proper construction of the provision of the Factories [Shops and Industries
Act 1962](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) ("the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/)") the
Respondent was to be regarded as the occupier of a factory in which factory, as he claimed, the Appellant had been injured. Sheller JA has concluded that the Respondent was so to be regarded, that conclusion, as I read his Honour's
Judgment, being based upon which I might call a literal interpretation of the definition of "occupier" contained in [s.4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/s4.html) of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/).

The primary reason for my inability to join in the conclusion to which Sheller
JA has come is that giving a literal meaning to the definition of "occupier" in [s.4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/s4.html) of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) is apt to produce incongruous results as the facts which have given rise to this appeal demonstrate. The fact that giving a literal meaning to the words of the statute will produce an incongruous result, or a capricious and irrational result, provides a justification for a court not according to the provision in question a literal meaning (see, for example, Grey v. Pearson [1];
Broken Hill South Limited v. Commissioner of Taxation [2];
Cooper Brooks (Wollongong) Pty. Limited v. Federal Commissioner of
Taxation [3]) 
In order that I might demonstrate that giving a literal meaning to the definition of "occupier" in [s.4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/s4.html) of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) is apt to produce an incongruous result, it is necessary for me to give some further factual background than is set out in the Judgment which has been prepared by
Sheller JA.

Cockatoo Island is located in the Parramatta River to the West of Birchgrove and to the North of Balmain. The evidence (AB 129) suggested that the island measured about one mile by one mile. At the time - June 1984 - when, so he said, the Appellant sustained the injuries in respect of which he sought to recover damages in these proceedings, the title to the island was, as it had for many years been, in the Commonwealth of Australia ("the Commonwealth") which had leased the island to a company known either as Vickers Cockatoo
Dockyard Pty. Limited or Cockatoo Dockyard Pty. Limited ("Cockatoo"). At the relevant time, the island was being used, as it had for many years been used, as a dockyard. At that time there appear to have been on the island two dry docks, one on the South-Eastern corner of the island known as Fitzroy Dock and one on the South-Western corner known as Sutherland Dock, a wet dock on the
Southern end of the island, a slipway on the western side of the island and what appears to have been a ferry wharf on the Northern extremity of the island.

At the time when the Appellant claimed to have sustained his injury, there were on the island, in addition to Cockatoo and its employees, a number of other companies or organisations and their respective employees, those other companies and organisations apparently being either contractors to carry out specified works for Cockatoo or sub-contractors to Cockatoo in respect of works which Cockatoo had contracted with others to carry out. Among those other companies or organisations which had contracted to carry out works for
Cockatoo were the Respondent and another company the only name of which was given in the evidence as being Rovira, each of the Respondent and Rovira having been engaged by Cockatoo for the purpose of carrying out works associated with the de-watering of the Sutherland Dock. Although the evidence as to the nature of those works is not entirely clear, it would seem that the works involved the removal from a pump house - a large two storeyed building some fifty metres, or thereabouts, in length -which was associated with the
Sutherland Dock of existing pumps and the installation of new pumps intended to exhaust the water from the dock when the dock gate had been closed, and to discharge that water back into the Parramatta River. As best as I can judge it, the work involved some blasting to enable the old pumps to be removed, some excavation work designed to provide a larger space within which the new pumps could be installed, removal of the old pumps and the rubble and the installation of new concrete in the area in which the new pumps were to be installed, all that work - described as "civil type engineering" - being the responsibility of the Respondent, while the actual installation of the new pumps which required, inter alia, the installation of a steel frame in a shaft in the pump house from ground level to the site of the new pumps - all of which work was described as "mechanical engineering" or "mechanical and electrical engineering" - was the responsibility of Rovira.

Although the pump house in which the work was to be carried out was associated with the Sutherland Dock, it was located some distance to the north of the dock itself. The Southern wall of the pump house appears to have been some twenty metres, or thereabouts, to the North of the Northern wall of the dock.
Between the Northern wall of the Dock and the Southern wall of the pump house was an area which was used regularly for access by, inter alia, vehicles belonging not only to Cockatoo but also to contractors and others working on the island and by a mobile crane which traversed rails which were laid in that area between the Northern wall of the Dock and the Southern wall of the pump house. In addition, to the West of the Western wall of the pump house was another area which was used by motor vehicles, whether owned by Cockatoo or others working on the island, as a means of access to the dock area from the
North. The water which was to be exhausted from the Sutherland Dock after the new pumps had been installed would pass through a tunnel under the access area to which I have just referred from a point commencing on the Northern side of the dock near a set of steps to which I will shortly refer and then to the pumps which, as I have earlier indicated, when installed would be located at the bottom of the shaft in the pump house to which I have earlier referred.
The area in which the activities to be undertaken by the Respondent were to be located was thus the pump house and, in particular, the shaft - some twenty metres, or thereabouts, deep - in the pump house through which the old pumps and the rubble was removed, the existing vault at the foot of the shaft from which the old pumps were to be removed and the expanded vault at the foot of the shaft into which the new pumps were to be installed, and the tunnel. The
Respondent was not required to carry out any work, and had no control whatsoever over any activities carried on, in the area between the Northern wall of the Dock and the Southern wall of the pump house to which I have earlier referred or the access road to the West of the pump house.

It was against this factual background that the Appellant, so he said, came to sustain the injuries in respect of which he sought to recover in the proceedings. On the day in question, so the Appellant said, he had been carrying out some work in the tunnel and had proceeded to the Southern end of the tunnel where he emerged on the floor of the Dock and proceeded to climb a set of stairs which adjoined the Northern wall of the Dock near its Western end where the dock gate was located. Having reached the top of the stairs, the
Appellant, so he said, proceeded in a Westerly direction for a short distance with a view then to crossing the access way and then moving to the pump house.
As he did so, he stepped upon a steel plate which gave way under his weight and he fell forward his left leg falling into the hole which, so he said, the steel plate had been partly covering. In falling, the Appellant, so he said, injured his left leg and knee and, as well, his left arm. It was the latter injury, so the Appellant said, which was the cause of the major disabilities in respect of which the Appellant sought to recover in the proceedings.

In the Statement of Claim which was filed on his behalf, the Appellant based his claim to recover damages in respect of his injuries upon two broad bases, they being: that the Respondent, as his employer, had failed in its duty to him to take reasonable care for his safety by (inter alia) providing a safe place of work for him; and that the Appellant had sustained his injuries as the result of what was alleged to be the failure of the Respondent to comply with the provision of ss. 34(a) and 40(1) of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/), which provisions, so it was said, were in the circumstances of the case binding upon the Respondent.

In order that one might understand the way in which the Appellant sought to found his claim upon the second of the bases which I have just set out, it is necessary to set out certain of the provisions of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/). They are as follows: "

 ........." (Sections 34, 40 and 70 are all to be found within [Part ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/index.html#p3) of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/).) 
The case which, in this respect, the Appellant sought to advance both at trial and on the hearing of this appeal might be reduced to the following basic propositions: by virtue of the terms of paragraph (d) of the definition of "factory" contained in [s.4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/s4.html) of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/), the whole of Cockatoo Island was at the relevant time a factory; in the light of the provisions of [s.4(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/s4.html) of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/), it mattered not that the place at which, so he claimed, the Appellant sustained his injury, was in the open air and in the area to which I have earlier referred which was between the Northern wall of the Sutherland Dock and the
Southern wall of the pump house, for that area was but part of "the factory"; since, at the relevant time, the Respondent employed the Appellant and others for the purposes of carrying out work on the island, the Respondent was, relevantly, "the occupier" of the "factory" which was, relevantly, the island; as the obligation to comply with the provisions of ss. 34(a) and 40(1) of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) was not specifically imposed on any person, then the provisions of s.70 of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) rendered the Respondent as being relevantly "the occupier" of the island guilty of an offence against the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/); given that the relevant provisions of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) were directed toward the safety and welfare of employees in factories, the
Respondent's failure to comply with the provisions of ss. 34(a) and 40(1) of the Act conferred upon the Appellant a right of action to recover damages in respect of any injury which he sustained as the result of the Respondent's failure so to comply with the provisions of those sections.

At trial, Patten DCJ, while allowing that part of the Appellant's claim which was based on the alleged failure of the Respondent (inter alia) to provide him with a safe place of work to go to the jury, on the application of the
Respondent withdrew so much of the Appellant's claim as was based on the provisions of s.34(a) and 40(1) of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) from the jury. In the event, as Sheller JA has recorded in his Judgment, the jury answered in the negative the question: "Do you find that the defendant was negligent as a result of which the plaintiff suffered injury?" following which Patten DCJ entered Judgment in favour of the Respondent and ordered the Appellant to pay the Respondent's costs other than those referable to an arbitration which had been held prior to the trial.

The only ground of any relevance which was taken in the Notice of Appeal which was filed on behalf of the Appellant on 6 October was: "1. His Honour erred in law in removing from the consideration of the jury question (sic) of whether or not the defendant was in breach of s.34(a) of the
Factories [Shops and Industries Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) as amended." 
When the Appellant's Written Submissions in support of the appeal were filed, there was also filed, by consent of the Respondent, an Amended Notice of
Appeal which relevantly sought to add a further ground of appeal as follows: "4. The verdict of the jury was perverse in that all the evidence demonstrated negligence on the part of the defendant giving rise to some damage, though there being no evidence to the contrary (sic)." 
When the appeal was called on for hearing, Mr. G. P. Segal appeared for the
Appellant while Mr. J.E. Maconachie QC appeared with Mr. D.S. Wilkins for the
Respondent.

At that time, Mr. Segal, on behalf of the Appellant, sought leave to file a yet further Amended Notice of Appeal which sought to raise as an additional ground the following: "5. His Honour erred in law in removing from the considering of the jury the question of whether or not the defendant was in breach of s.40(1) of the ...
Act." 
Leave to file that Further Amended Notice of Appeal was opposed by Mr.
Maconachie and the Court (T.50) reserved, until the delivery of Judgment on the appeal, the question whether that leave ought to be deemed to have been granted.

Although I found Mr. Segal's submissions at times a little difficult to follow, those submissions did appear to advance the following propositions: the whole island was "a factory" because the whole island was a ship yard "from beginning to end" (T.7-8); the fact that there were, at the relevant time, on the island various head contractors and others and that in the area where the Appellant was from time to time working there were at least two contractors (T. 6) was not relevant since: there can be several occupiers of a factory (T.8); or there can be several occupiers of different parts of a factory (T.8); since the Appellant was employed by the Respondent to carry out work on the island, the Respondent was to be regarded as an occupier of the factory, being the island, or, at the least, an occupier of part of the factory which was the island - however, what was said to be the relevant part of the island which was occupied was not identified, although it seemed to be said that the area between the North wall of the Dock and the South wall of the Pump House was included in that part of the island which the Respondent was said to occupy. The fact that the Respondent had no power of control over what was done in, and no power to carry out works on, that part of the island was irrelevant - the test of whether or not a person was an occupier was whether or not that person employed persons in the factory or the relevant part of the factory rather than whether that person could control what was done in the factory or that part of the factory.

If, as the Judgment which Sheller JA has prepared suggests is the case, the various propositions advanced by Mr. Segal are to be accepted whether in their broadest, or in their more limited, form, then, as it seems to me, the following consequences necessarily follow: a company or organisation which is brought into "a factory", for but a limited purpose, as for example, as contractor or sub-contractor, to carry out any work in "the factory" becomes, and, while so engaged, remains, obliged: to keep records in relation to all "employees" in the factory whether or not those "employees" are employed by it for its purposes (ss. 9, 15); becomes obliged to carry out, or to ensure that there have been carried out, works of construction or maintenance (s.34) and to ensure that the activities in "the factory" are carried out in a particular way (s.40(1)), even though that company or organisation has no right at law to carry out such works or to control the means by which activities in "the factory" are carried out; in the event that there has been any failure to comply with such provisions of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) then, even though the means of compliance was not within the power of the company or organisation in question, it is liable to be prosecuted and found guilty of an offence against the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) (s.70); in the event that there has been a failure to comply with the provisions of such sections as ss. 34(a) and 40(1) of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) and some person, whether or not an employee of the company or organisation in question, sustains injury in consequence thereof, then, notwithstanding that the means of compliance with those provisions did not lie within the power of the company or organisation in question, that company or organisation is nonetheless liable to compensate the person who was injured.

Taken to its ultimate lengths this last proposition must mean that, in a case such as this, a company or organisation employed to carry out, for example, electrical work at some point on the island far removed from the area where the Appellant claims to have fallen, would be liable to compensate any person, whether employed by Cockatoo or by any contractor to, or sub-contractor of,
Cockatoo, who claimed to have injured himself at the place and in the manner alleged by the Appellant.

That the construction contended for by the Appellant and adopted by Sheller JA in his Judgment leads inevitably to such an incongruous result leads me to conclude that, unless the language of the statute is intractable, such a construction, which requires that each and every company or organisation, whether the general occupier of the relevant factory or not, which employs people to carry out work whether for the purposes of the undertaking being carried on by the general occupier of the factory or for some other purpose, is to be regarded as an occupier of the whole factory, ought not to be adopted.

I do not regard the language of the statute as so intractable as to require the result contended for by the Appellant. On the contrary, the use of the definite article in the phrase "the person, partnership, association or corporation employing persons in the factory or shop or occupying the factory or shop" in the definition of "occupier" in [s.4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/s4.html), and in the phrase "the occupier of that factory or of that shop" appearing in s.70, of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) suggests to me that some other construction than that contended for is called for, that construction being to the effect that "the occupier" is a reference to either the general occupier of the factory in question, or the company or organisation the employees of which, for the time being, are carrying out work in the particular part of the factory where the relevant breach of the said is said to have occurred.

The process of reasoning which led Sheller JA to the conclusion expressed by him in his Judgment appears to me to involve the following steps: the definition of "occupier" now appearing in [s.4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/s4.html) of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) has a long lineage extending back, at least, to the definition in s.2 of the [Factories and Shops Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1896196/) ("the [1896 Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1896196/)"); since the definition comprehends two distinct situations "employing persons in any factory or shop" and "occupying any office building or place used as a factory or shop" the two phrases being used disjunctively, it is clear that those persons or companies who, or which, were, or are, to be regarded as "occupiers" for the purposes of the relevant Act were not limited to those persons or companies who fell within the common law concept of an occupier, that is, one who had, or has, a degree of control over the relevant premises; that this was, and is, so was made clear by the provisions of s.54 of the [1896 Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1896196/), the substance of which was reproduced in s.61 of the [Factories and Shops Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1912196/) ("the [1912 Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1912196/)") - but was not reproduced in the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) - which section, so it is suggested, was designed to modify what would otherwise have been the draconian consequences which could have flowed from giving the definition of "occupier" its full defined meaning. Further support for that view was to be found in the passage from Glass, McHugh and Douglas: The
Liability of Employers set out by Sheller JA on p.12 of his Judgment; the views to the contrary expressed in the passage from Callaghan:
Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 which Sheller JA has set out on pp.
-13 of his Judgment are based upon cases decided in England and Scotland under a safety regulation which contains no definition of "occupier" apt to extend the meaning of that word beyond the common law concept and, thus, are irrelevant to the question of the construction of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/).

Although the discussion in the House which attended the second reading of the
Bill which became the [1896
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1896196/) indicates that the provisions of that Bill were based on the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act 1878 (Imp), the provisions of the Bill were far less extensive in their operation than were the provisions of the English Act and those Acts which, by 1895, had extended it in England. Thus, the Factory and
Workshop Act 1895 (Imp) s.23(1)(ii) provided (inter alia): "The provisions of the Factory Acts, with respect to accidents; ... shall have effect as if (a) every dock, wharf, quay, and warehouse, and, so far as relates to the process of loading and unloading therefrom or thereto, all machinery and plant used in that process ... were included in the word factory, and the purpose for which the machinery is used were a manufacturing process and as if the person who by himself, his agents, or workmen temporarily uses any such machinery for the before-mentioned purpose were the occupier of the said premises; and for the purpose of the enforcement of those sections the person having the actual use or occupation of a dock, wharf, quay, or warehouse, or of any premises within the same or forming part thereof, and the person so using any such machinery shall be deemed to be the occupier of a factory." 
That provision was held to mean that the owners of a ship moored alongside a quay, who acted as their own stevedores and who had the use of the portion of the quay alongside which their ship lay, for the purpose of unloading the ship's cargo, were the occupiers of a factory, being that part of the quay alongside which their ship lay (Merrill v. Wilson, Sons & Co.,
Limited [4]); that stevedores who were loading a vessel in a dock, using machinery installed there, were the occupiers of a factory being the machinery (Stuart v. Nixon & Bruce [5]); that ship repairers who took a ship into a dry dock which they had hired for the purpose of cleaning and repairing the ship were the occupiers of a factory being the dock (Raine v. R. Jobson & Co. [6]); and that contractors who had been engaged to do the painting and plumbing on a ship lying in a dock were the occupiers of a factory being the ship in the dock (Bartell v. W. Gray & Co. [7]; cp
Houlder Line Limited v. Griffin [8]).

By contrast the definition of "Factory" in the [1896
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1896196/) was: " `Factory' means any office, building or place in which four or more persons are engaged directly or indirectly in working at any handicraft, or in preparing or manufacturing articles for trade or sale; and includes bake houses, laundries, and dye works in which four or more persons are engaged; but does not include any building or place in which the persons engaged in working are shown to the satisfaction of the Minister to be all members of one family, and in which steam or other mechanical power is not used; any office, building, or place in which Chinese are so engaged; and any place or building where steam or other mechanical power or appliance is used in manufacturing goods or packing them for transit; but does not include any building used for the manufacture of dairy produce, nor any wool shed used for shearing sheep, or building used for dumping wool, or any ship." while the definition of "Occupier" was: " `Occupier' means the person, company, or association employing persons in any factory or shop, or occupying any office, building, or place used as a factory or shop, and includes any agent, manager, foreman, or other person acting or apparently acting in the general management or control of any factory or shop." (my emphasis) 
Section 49 of the [1896
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1896196/) provided that if a factory or shop were not kept in conformity with the Act or regulations the occupier of the factory should on conviction be liable to a penalty, while s.54 of the Act was in the terms set out by Sheller JA on p. 9 of his Judgment.

The provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act 1895 (Imp) appear to have been repealed and re-enacted in the Factory and Workshop Act 1901 (Imp) which Act was mainly, although not entirely, a consolidating Act (see Smith v.
Cammell, Laird & Company Limited [9]) s. 104 of the latter Act replacing s.23(1)(ii) of the earlier Act. In 1903 (Weavings v. Kirk &
Randall [10]) contractors who had been engaged to erect certain pigeon holes twelve feet high in the upper storey of a warehouse, which was being built within the precincts of Woolwich Dockyard for the government by other contractors, were held to be the occupiers of a factory being that part of the warehouse in which they were required to carry out the works in question.

The [1896 Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1896196/) was repealed by the [1912
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1912196/) in which
Act the definition of "factory", although differently arranged, did not differ in substance from that contained in the [1896
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1896196/) while the definition of "occupier" was in the same terms as those contained in the [1896
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1896196/). Section 56 of the [1912
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1912196/) provided that if a factory or shop were not kept in conformity with that part of the
Act relating to factories and shops or if there were a contravention or breach of the provisions of that part the occupier should on conviction be liable to a penalty while s.61, to which Sheller JA has referred in his Judgment provided that if the occupier of a factory were charged with an offence and were able to prove to the satisfaction of the Justices that he had used due diligence to enforce the provisions of the relevant part of the Act and that another had committed the offence in question without his knowledge, consent or connivance that other should be liable to be convicted and the occupier should be exempt from penalty.

The [1912 Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1912196/) was amended by the Factories and Shops (Amendment) Act 1927 ("the 1927 Act") by (inter alia) inserting after paragraph (d) of the definition of "factory" in s.3 of the [1912
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1912196/) the following new paragraph: "(e) any ship or boat building yard or dock in which any ship or boat is constructed, reconstructed, repaired, refitted or finished or broken up." 
That provision appears not to have been in the Bill when it was first presented to the Legislative Assembly but was introduced by amendment when the
Bill was dealt with in Committee in the Assembly, the object of the amendment being said by the Minister, the Hon J. M. Baddeley, the Minister for Labour and Industry, to be "to extend the provisions regarding sanitation and other matters of a similar character to all places which may be regarded as work shops", the addition "being made at the suggestion of the officials of the
Health Department" (NSW Parliamentary debates 2nd Session 1926 p.1037).

When the Bill came to be read a second time in the Legislative Council, the
Minister in charge of the Bill, the Hon. A.C. Willis, Vice-President of the
Executive Council, said (NSW Parliamentary Debates Session 1926-27 p.316): "Clause 2 involves the definition of `factory' in the principal Act. The definition is amended to include `any ship or boat building yard or dock in which any ship or boat is constructed, reconstructed, repaired, refitted or finished or broken up.' Deputations from persons employed and interested in the boilermakers, shipwrights, and engineering trades have repeatedly waited upon the Minister for Labour and Industry to request that such alteration of the definition should be made. Under the English Factory and Workshop Act , regulations had been made governing the process of loading, unloading, handling and moving goods in, on, or at any wharf, dock, or quay, and the process of loading, unloading, and coaling any ship in any dock, harbour or canal. It will be seen that the English Act goes much further in the direction of the protection of marine workers than is proposed in the Bill. When this matter was under discussion in the other place the Leader of the Opposition stated there could be little or no objection to the inclusion of these places as factories." 
The clause in question did not appear to invite any further comment during the course of the debate on the motion that the bill be read a second time nor any discussion when the Bill was dealt with in Committee.

The [1912 Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1912196/) was further amended by the Factories and Shops (Amendment) Act 1931, but not in any respect material to the present question.

The [1912 Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1912196/) was further amended by the Factories and Shops (Amendment) Act 1936. So far as is relevant to the present question, the amendments involved the omission from s.3 of the previous definition of "factory" and the insertion of a new definition of "factory". For the most part, the new definition did little more than restructure the form of the previous definition while preserving the substance of the earlier provision. However, the new definition included as a "factory" any office building or place in which: "(iii) one or more persons are employed in a manufacturing process involving mixing, pasting or smelting, in connection with the manufacture or repair of electric accumulators or the use of a compound of lead or spray painting;" while, at the end of the new definition there were included the words: "A place shall not be excluded from the definition of a `factory' by reason only that the place is in the open air." which words may now be found in [s.4(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/s4.html) of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/).

Although the latter amendment attracted no comment when the Bill was dealt with in the Legislative Assembly, the former amendment attracted the following comment from the relevant Minister, the Hon. J.M. Dunningham, Minister for
Labour and Industry, when moving the second reading (NSW Parliamentary Debates
Session 1935-36 p.4904): "The main purposes of most of the Factories and Shops provisions in this Bill are to clean up the existing law, and to bring it into line with modern factory development and legislation elsewhere. The definition of `factory' is being extended to include the types of establishment covered by the Victorian and English Acts; for instance, establishments where electric accumulators are manufactured and repaired, irrespective of the number of persons engaged, or whether or not mechanical power is used.
 .........

At present there is no requirement to compel the registration of these premises as factories, unless four or more persons are employed or mechanical power is used, and then only when accumulators are being manufactured, so that premises where electric accumulators are repaired only are not subject to regulation or inspection by factory inspectors, notwithstanding the serious hazard of led poisoning." 
No further comment was made on either proposed amendment during the debate on the motion that the Bill be read a second time nor when the Bill was dealt with in Committee, the Bill passing through all further stages on the same evening as that on which the Bill was read a second time.

Although the [1912
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1912196/) was further amended on a number of occasions prior to its repeal by the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/), none of the amendments made by the amending Acts is of relevance to the present question.

Before turning to deal with such matters as are relevant to the enactment of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) and to its terms, it is convenient to refer to the decision of the House of Lords in
Smith v. Cammell, Laird & Company Limited [11] to which Sheller JA has referred on pp. 10-11 of his Judgment, in which case the question for determination was what was the proper construction to be given to certain provisions of regulations made by the Secretary of State pursuant to the provisions of s.79 of the Factory and Workshop Act 1901.

Section 79 of the Factory and Workshop Act 1901 (Imp) provided: "Where the Secretary of State is satisfied that any manufacture, machinery, plant, process or description of manual labour used in factories or workshops is dangerous or injurious to health or dangerous to life or limb either generally or in the case of women, children or any other class of persons, he may certify that manufacture, machinery, plant, process or description of manual labour to be dangerous, and thereupon the Secretary of State may, subject to the provisions of his Act, make such regulations as appear to him to be reasonably practicable and to meet the necessity of the case." 
By s. 149 and the second part of the Sixth Schedule to the Act, there were included in the definition of "factories" " `shipbuilding yards' that is to say any premises in which any ships, boats or vessels used in navigation are made, finished or repaired." 
The Ship Building Regulations 1931 provided that it should be the duty of "the occupier" to comply with (inter alia) Part II of the Regulations. Part II of the Regulations provided (inter alia): "II(a) A sufficient supply of sound and substantial material shall be available in a convenient place or places for the construction of staging. 
All staging shall be securely constructed of sound and substantial material and shall be maintained in such condition as to ensure the safety of all persons employed, be inspected at regular and frequent intervals by a competent person." 
The respondents to the appeal to the House of Lords were constructing in their ship building yard a vessel for ship owners, which vessel had been launched and placed for finishing in a wet dock in that yard. For the purposes of their building operations, the respondents had erected in the lower forehold the vessel a staging which they no longer used themselves. The ship owners employed an insulation company to do certain work in the vessel and the respondents allowed that company to occupy and use the staging in the course of their work. Owing to a defect in the staging, the appellant, an employee of the insulation company, while engaged in his work, fell from the staging and was injured. In respect of his injuries he sued the respondents claiming damages which he alleged were caused by their negligence and by their breach of the statutory duty cast upon them by the regulations. The actions had been heard at first instance by Goddard J (as his Lordship then was) who held that the duty imposed by the regulations of seeing that the staging was safe was a duty cast upon the occupiers of the premises, and for the purpose of the occupation in question, the insulation company were the occupiers of the staging, or of the part of the ship where the staing was erected, upon whom therefore the duty was cast, in the light of which conclusion his Lordship held that the appellant had no cause of action against the respondents.

From that decision the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal which by majority (Greer and Clauson LJJ, Slesser LJ diss.) held that the regulations as regards their provisions for the security of staging did not affect s.104 of the Factory and Workshop Act 1901, so as, for the purposes of the case, to render the ship building yard the only possible "factory" and the ship builders the only "occupiers" thereof, or necessarily to prevent premises forming part thereof from the becoming a "factory" and the occupiers thereof the "occupiers" of a factory; that the part of the vessel in which the staging was erected constituted a "factory" within the meaning of the Act and
Regulations, the occupiers of which were, not the respondents, but the insulation company.

The appeal to the House of Lords was, by majority (Lord Atkin, Lord Russell of
Killowen, Lord Wright, Lord Porter; Viscount Maugham diss) allowed. The reasoning of Lord Atkin [12] is instructive: "The two questions that arise on II(b) are: was the duty to maintain the staging in such a condition as to ensure the safety of all persons employed imposed in the circumstances on Cammell Laird & Co; if so, was it an absolute duty? 
On the first question, it appears to me that if one seeks to inquire into the meaning of the word `occupier' in the sentence stating that it is the duty of the occupier to comply with Parts I to VIII by asking, occupier of what, the only answer can be occupier of that which alone has been previously mentioned in the regulations as capable of being occupied, namely, the ship building yard which is the factory within which the regulations are to operate. It is not the occupier of the `staging or that part of the ship' (Goddard J); `such part of the ship as was necessary for the work which the Cork Insulation Co had to do' (Greer LJ); `the place where the accident occurred', `the locus where the staging stood' (Clauson LJ). Nor is the `occupier' the right word to describe the person controlling the work in doing which the accident happened, or the person using the machinery which gives rise to an accident, as was contended for by the respondents. 
We have not got to consider here the question of separate manufacturing businesses being carried on by separate occupiers in the same building; or the case where under s.149, sub-s. 2 with the approval of the chief inspector a part of a factory may be taken for the purposes of this Act to be a separate factory. There is nothing in the Act or Regulations which in the present case makes the hold or the staging a separate factory, and I can entertain no doubt that the duty under s.II(b) is imposed upon the occupier of the only relevant factory, the shipbuilding yard, i.e. upon Cammell Laird & Company." 
As Sheller JA has noted in his Judgment, the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/), while reproducing a provision (s.70) which is in substance to the same effect as the provisions of s.49 of the [1896
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1896196/) and s.56 of the [1912 Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1912196/), did not contain any provision to the effect of that contained in s.54 of the [1896 Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1896196/) or s.61 of the [1912
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/fasa1912196/). The fact that no such provision was included in the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) does not appear to have been the result of any oversight on the part of the
Parliament. That this was so is indicated by the fact that, during the course of the debate on the motion that the Bill be read a second time in the
Legislative Council, the Hon. C.E. Begg (as his Honour then was) said (inter alia): "I have mentioned a few matters which show that the Bill has been ill- considered. I invite the attention of hon. members also to the fact that a sensible provision in the Act has been omitted from the Bill without any reason being given. S. 61 provides: .........

That provision makes sense; it is fair and it is a proper provision to appear in an Act that is studded with penalties. I have searched to see whether s.61 is incorporated in the new Bill, and I shall be surprised if it is. I cannot find it. Why is this left out? Is it deliberately left out to push home a liability on the occupier of a factory, shop or farm? If a manager is actually guilty of an offence, such as taking a guard off a machine in defiance of orders, and somebody is injured, the occupier pays the penalty. Under s.61 he had the right to say: `You are the person responsible. You should be convicted'. Now that has gone. Why should we interfere with the law as it stands?" 
Despite the matter having been drawn to the attention of the House in this way, no further comment on it appears to have been made during the course of debate on the motion that the Bill be read a second time nor, so far as I can discern, was the matter taken up when the Bill was dealt with in Committee.

This, as it seems to me, is a matter of some significance when one comes to consider the proper construction of s.70 of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) - which both creates an offence and gives rise to a cause of action for damages a the suit of one who may be injured by a contravention of the section - for, despite the less stringent approach now taken to the construction of penal sections, the modern approach, as Gibbs J (as he then was) put it in
Beckwith v. The Queen [13] is: "In determining the meaning of a penal statute the ordinary rules of construction must be applied, but if the language of the statute remains ambiguous or doubtful the ambiguity or doubt must be resolved in favour of the subject by refusing to extend the category of criminal offences." 
In the light of the various matters to which I have referred above, it seems to me that, rather than the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) being construed in the way advocated on behalf of the Appellant and favoured by
Sheller JA, which construction leads to the result that, in the present case, each and every company or organisation, whether that company or organisation be Cockatoo or one which has contracted with Cockatoo to do work for it or has become a sub-contractor to Cockatoo, which, at the relevant time, employed any person to do any work at any point on the island was to be regarded as an occupier of each and every part of the island, the Act should be construed either: so as to hold that there was only one occupier - Cockatoo - of the island; or if some lesser construction is to be called for, so as to hold that each such company or organisation, other than Cockatoo, was to be regarded as the occupier of only that part of the island in which that company or organisation was required to carry out, or in fact carried out, work.

The matters which favour the former construction are: the relevant part of the definition of "factory" contained in [s.4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/s4.html) of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) which is relied upon by the Appellant is paragraph (d); as the Appellant would have it, there was, in the present case, only one place which fell within that description, that is, the whole of the island; if, for the purposes of the definition of "occupier" one inquiries what was "the ... corporation employing persons in the (dock yard) ... or occupying the (dock yard)" then the only answer would seem to be Cockatoo - the others companies and organisations would seem more accurately described as companies or organisations which employed people to do work in (the dock yard); such a construction would thus impose the obligation to comply with the provisions of s.34(a) and s.40(1) of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/), upon which the Appellant relied, upon Cockatoo, which had the capacity as lessee and as the common law occupier to carry out those obligations; such a construction would mean that companies and organisations such as the Respondent and Rovira which did not have the capacity to meet those obligations would not be exposed to either criminal or civil penalties for non-compliance.

Approaching the question of construction in this way would seem to accord with the process of reasoning adopted by Lord Atkin and the other members of the majority in Smith v. Cammell Laird & Company Limited [14].

The provisions of [s.8(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/s8.html) of the [Interpretation Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ia1987191/) to the effect that, in any Act, a reference to a word or expression in the singular form includes a reference to the word or expression in the plural form might justify a construction which recognised that a factory might have more than one "occupier". However, if such a construction were adopted, then it would seem to me that the words "employing persons in the factory ... or occupying the factory" in the definition of "occupier" in [s.4(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/s4.html) of the [1962
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/saia1962237/) must be read distributively so as to refer only to that part of the relevant factory - in this case - the island - where the relevant employer - in this case the
Respondent - was required to carry out, or in fact carried out work. Such an approach would be not unlike that adopted in Merrill v. Wilson Sons &
Co. Limited [15], Raine v. R Jobson & Co. [16], Bartell v. W.
Gray & Co. [17] and Weavings v. Kirk and Randall [18].

In the present case, it matters not which of the two constructions which I favour be adopted for, even if the second construction be adopted, it is clear that at the relevant time the Respondent was not required to carry out any work, and did not in fact carry out any work, in the area where the Appellant claimed to have sustained his injury, which area, as I have earlier pointed out, was open for use by, and was in fact used by, all and sundry who happened to be on the island at the relevant time.

In my opinion the Appeal should be dismissed with costs.
