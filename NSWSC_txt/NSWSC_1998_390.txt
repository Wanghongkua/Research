JUDGMENT 
HIS HONOUR: 
In proceedings initially commenced in the Supreme Court and transferred to the
District Court (hereafter "the primary proceedings"), the plaintiff claims damages for personal injury, allegedly received as a result of negligent medical treatment.

The primary proceedings were transferred to the District Court in August 1997 pursuant to <case> of the [District Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/). At that time, the jurisdiction of that court was limited to $750,000 in actions for personal injury other than in relation to motor accident claims.

Following receipt of further expert evidence, the plaintiff's solicitors requested the defendant's solicitors to consent to an extension of the
District Court's jurisdiction. The defendant declined to give that consent.

The [District Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/) has now been amended by the Court's Legislation Further Amendment Act 1997. Prior to the amendment, [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s44.html) of the [District Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/) provided as follows: "44(1) Subject to this Act, the Court has jurisdiction to hear and dispose of the following actions: any personal action at law (other than a motor accident claim) in which the amount claimed does not exceed $750,000, whether on a balance of account or after an admitted set-off or otherwise; any action to recover goods that have been detained, or to recover the assessed value of such goods, in which the value of the goods together with the amount of any consequential damages claimed for the detention of the goods does not exceed $750,000; any action brought to recover an amount not exceeding $20,000, which is the whole or part of the unliquidated balance of a partnership account, or the amount or part of the amount of the distributive share under an intestacy or of a legacy under a will.
 any motor accident claim, irrespective of the amount claimed." 
As amended by the 1997 statute, <case> provides as follows: "44(1) Subject to this Act, the Court has jurisdiction to hear and dispose of the following actions: any action of a kind: which, if brought in the Supreme Court, would be assigned to the Common
Law Division of that Court, and in which the amount claimed does not exceed $750,000, whether on a balance of account or after an admitted set-off or otherwise, other than an action referred to in paragraph (d) or (e), * * * * * any action brought to recover an amount not exceeding $20,000, which is the whole or part of the unliquidated balance of a partnership account, or the amount or part of the amount of the distributive share under an intestacy or of a legacy under a will, any motor accident claim irrespective of the amount claimed, any proceedings transferred to the Court under section 143(1), irrespective of the amount (if any) claimed in the proceedings." 
The 1997 amendment came into effect on 2 February 1998.

By an amended summons filed on 17 August 1998, the plaintiff claims a declaration that the District Court has jurisdiction pursuant to [s (1)(e)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/s44.html) of the [District Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/). The object of that claim is to secure a determination that the District Court has unlimited jurisdiction in relation to the primary proceedings, notwithstanding that the amendment, giving the Court unlimited jurisdiction in relation to personal injury cases generally, post-dates the order transferring the proceedings to the District Court.

An alternative claim is made in the amended summons for the primary proceedings to be removed back to this court. That, however, is not the plaintiff's preferred option.
 [Section (2)(g)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s48.html) of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) provides that proceedings for determining any matter concerning the powers of a specified tribunal are assigned to the Court of Appeal. (The District Court is a specified tribunal.) [Section (1)(d)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s51.html) provides that, where proceedings so assigned to the Court of Appeal have been commenced in a Division, the proceedings may be continued and disposed of in the Division subject to any order otherwise made by the Court of Appeal or the
Division.

In the present case, the defendant appears and makes no submission in opposition to the claim for a declaration being heard in this Division or in opposition to the claim for the declaration itself. In those circumstances, I see no objection to the matter proceeding in this Division, and I am content to hear and determine the claim.

The decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Ex parte Palmer re McCabe [(1967) 87 WN 132] is directly in point. In that case, an enlarged jurisdiction was specified in the amended legislation as applying "(w)here at a trial of any cause or issue in a District Court a verdict is returned ...". In the present case, the enlarged jurisdiction is "to hear and dispose of the following actions ...".
In Palmer, the enlarged jurisdiction was held to apply in relation to any trial post-dating the amendment. By parity of reasoning, the amended legislation in the present case applies to the hearing and disposal of proceedings post-dating the amendment. It is simply a matter of the ordinary meaning of the words dictating the incidence of the amended legislation.

The same result is reached by application of the tenets of statutory construction laid down in such cases as Maxwell versus Murphy <case>; <case>; [(1990) 169 CLR 515.] Absent discerned legislative intention to the contrary, an amendment affecting procedure as distinct from substantive rights operates prospectively. Relevantly, the principle was applied in Walter John Bailey v
Glass [(1992) 6 FCR 290], where it was held that a statute which simply enlarged a jurisdiction the court would otherwise possess applied to any proceedings heard and determined after the amendment.

For these reasons, the declaration should be made.

I make order 1 in the amended summons. The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs of the summons.
