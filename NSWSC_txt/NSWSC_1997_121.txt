Regina versus Wayne Peehi [1997] NSWSC 121 (9 April 1997) 
REGINA versus Wayne PEEHI /96 
Wednesday 9 April 1997 
IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL 
GLEESON CJ, HUNT CJ at CL, HIDDEN J 
CATCHWORDS: CRIMINAL LAW - bail - escape from lawful custody (common law misdemeanour) - appellant bailed to appear in District Court - flees in the course of the hearing - whether still on bail or in custody of the court at that time.

EX TEMPORE/RESERVED: Reserved 
ALLOWED/DISMISSED: Dismissed 
The appellant had appealed to the District Court against the severity of sentences imposed upon him in a Local Court and was granted bail pending the appeal. He appeared at the District Court in answer to his bail but, while the judge was giving his reasons prior to dismissing the appeal, the appellant ran from the courtroom and out of the building. He was apprehended shortly thereafter and returned to the court where the appeal was dismissed.

He was charged with the common law misdemeanour of escaping from lawful custody. At his trial it was submitted that there was no case to answer because he was not in custody at the relevant time. The trial judge found a case to answer on the basis that he was then in the custody of the court. He was found guilty by the jury and sentenced.

On appeal against his conviction, 
Held that when the hearing in the District Court commenced, the appellant had appeared before the court in accordance with his bail undertaking within the meaning of [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s7.html) of the [Bail Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) and his right to remain at liberty ceased. He was then in the custody of the court and no occasion arose for the continuance of his bail under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s43.html) of the Act before he fled from the courtroom. Accordingly, he was in the custody of the court at the relevant time and the case was properly left to the jury.

Provisions of the [Bail
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/), in particular [s (e)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s6.html), [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s7.html) and [s 43(3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s43.html) considered.
 
JUDGMENT 
GLEESON CJ: I have had the benefit of reading in draft form the judgment of
Hidden J. I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour and with his reasons for those orders.

HUNT CJ at CL: I agree with Hidden J, for the reasons which he has given, that the appeal be dismissed.

HIDDEN J: Wayne Peehi appeals against his conviction upon a charge of escaping from lawful custody (the common law misdemeanour) after a trial before his
Honour, Judge Howie QC and a jury at the Sydney District Court in June 1996.
His Honour sentenced the appellant to 12 months imprisonment, comprising a minimum term of three months and an additional term of nine months, to commence at the expiration of a minimum term to which he was then subject in respect of another matter. The only ground of appeal is that his Honour should have directed the jury to acquit the appellant at the close of the Crown case.

The facts are not in dispute. On 13 December 1995, the appellant was sentenced by a magistrate at the Central Local Court to imprisonment in respect of a number of assault charges. He appealed against the severity of that sentence to the District Court. On 24 January 1996, he was granted bail by the Supreme
Court pending the hearing of the appeal. By his bail undertaking, he undertook to appear at the Sydney District Court on a date to be fixed for the hearing of the appeal, and it was a condition of his bail that he prosecute that appeal diligently.

On 28 February 1996, the applicant attended the Downing Centre for the hearing of the appeal, which was listed before Blanch J, the Chief Judge of the
District Court. The hearing proceeded and, while Blanch J was delivering his judgment, the appellant suddenly stood up and ran from the courtroom. He ran out of the building into Elizabeth Street, and was pursued by Sheriff's officers and an off-duty police officer who happened to be in the area at the time. He was apprehended in a building in Wentworth Avenue and returned to the court, where Blanch J completed his judgment dismissing the appeal.

At the trial, the appellant did not dispute these facts but put forward an explanation for his actions, which is not material for present purposes.

At the close of the Crown case, counsel then appearing for the appellant, who did not argue the appeal, submitted that there was no case to answer on the basis that there was no evidence that the appellant was in lawful custody at the relevant time. His Honour found a case to answer, holding that the appellant was in the custody of the court. In summing-up, he directed the jury that the appellant, having answered his bail and appeared before Blanch J, "was then in the lawful custody of the court until he was given permission by the court to leave." There is no suggestion that any such permission was given.

In this court Mr Craddock, for the appellant, argued that the District Court has no custodial power, express or implied. Nothing in the [District Court
Act, 1973](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dca1973187/), nor the sections of the [Justices Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealedact/ja1902119/) dealing with appeals to the District Court, expressly confer such a power. The [Bail
Act, 1978](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) contains no reference to the custody of a court, be it the District Court or any other court. Mr Craddock acknowledged that, in addition to the powers expressly conferred upon it by statute, the District Court has the implied power to do whatever is necessary to fulfil its statutory functions: R v
Moseley [(1992) 28 NSWLR 735], per
Gleeson CJ at 739. However, he argued that no custodial power need be implied, because the [Bail
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) provides all that is required for the discharge of the court's functions in relation to the custody of litigants such as the appellant. It is necessary then to examine the relevant sections of that Act.

By [s 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s4.html) bail is defined as "authorisation to be at liberty under this Act, instead of in custody." [Section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s7.html) provides: "When: bail is granted to an accused person in respect of an offence; the person enters into the bail undertaking; and if a bail condition or bail conditions are imposed, it or they are entered into, the person is, subject to this Act, entitled to be released (if in custody) and to remain at liberty in respect of the offence, until the person is required to appear before a court in accordance with the person's undertaking." 
The concluding words of that sub-section are of critical importance in this appeal.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s34.html) deals with bail undertakings, the relevant provisions being as follows: "(1) A person shall not be released on bail unless the person undertakes, in writing, to appear before such court, on such day and at such time and place as are from time to time specified in a notice given or sent to the person as prescribed by the regulations.
 ......

A bail undertaking may include an undertaking, if bail is continued, to appear at any time and place at which proceedings in respect of the offence may be continued, whether upon an adjournment, committal or otherwise.

An accused person who is granted bail is under a duty to appear in person before a court in accordance with the person's bail undertaking." 
The document signed by the appellant included an undertaking, pursuant to [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s34.html), that if bail were continued, he would appear at any time and place at which the proceedings might be continued "whether upon an adjournment or otherwise".
The bail undertaking also sets out the conditions, imposed under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s36.html) of the Act, to which the bail was subject, including the condition that the appellant prosecute his appeal diligently.
 [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s43.html) deals with the continuance of bail as follows: "(1) If a bail undertaking includes an undertaking to appear at any time and place at which proceedings in respect of the offence may be continued, whether upon an adjournment, committal or otherwise, a court may accordingly continue bail already granted in respect of the offence, whether or not the accused person then appears in person.

Where bail is continued, the bail undertaking and the bail conditions continue to apply, except to the extent that a condition or agreement thereunder otherwise provides or the court otherwise orders.

If the accused person appears before a court in accordance with a bail undertaking referred to in subsection (1) but no specific direction is made by the court in respect of bail, the court is taken to have continued bail." 
Mr Craddock submitted that the effect of [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s43.html) is that, at the time he ran from the courtroom, the appellant was still on bail and not in any form of custody. As Blanch J had made no specific direction under that sub-section, bail must be taken to have been continued. In other words, [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s43.html) means that, in the absence of any direction by a court, a person who appears in answer to bail remains on bail, not only during adjournments of a hearing, but also during the hearing itself. I do not agree with this interpretation of the sub-section.

By [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s7.html), a person on bail is entitled to remain at liberty until he or she "is required to appear before a court" in accordance with the bail undertaking. To determine when a person appears before a court is not as simple as it seems, and I shall have more to say about that shortly. There can be no doubt, however, that the appellant appeared before the court in the relevant sense when the hearing of his appeal commenced. At that point, by the terms of the sub-section, his right to remain at liberty ceased.

In my view, subs (3) of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s43.html) should be read in the light of subs (1) of that section, which empowers a court to continue bail already granted where there has been an undertaking to appear at any time and place at which the proceedings may be continued. Sub- section (1) arises from the necessity to deal with the question of bail when, for one reason or another, the hearing of the proceedings is postponed or interrupted. Before us the Crown prosecutor submitted that the section as a whole is concerned only with the adjournment of a hearing to another day, but
I do not see why it is not applicable to temporary interruptions of a hearing during the course of a day, such as the morning tea or lunch adjournments. The purpose of subs (3) is to ensure that bail is continued at the time of any adjournment of the hearing should the court omit to make any specific order.

That this is its purpose is apparent from the legislative history. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s10.html) provides: "10(1) A court that may grant bail to an accused person may instead dispense with the requirement for bail.

Where, during an appearance by an accused person before a court, no specific order or direction is made by the court in respect of bail, the court shall be deemed to have dispensed with the requirement for bail.

Subsection (2) does not apply if bail is continued in accordance with [section (3)."](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s43.html) 
Both [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s10.html) and [s (3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s43.html) were added by the Bail (Domestic Violence) Amendment Act, 1993 which effected significant amendments to the Act generally. As the Act stood prior to their insertion, it was arguable that, if a court omitted to make any order at the time of an adjournment, bail would be deemed to have been dispensed with by virtue of <case>. In his second reading speech, the then Premier said: "The bill ensures that bail is not dispensed with where a court later omits or fails to make a bail determination. Bail will be deemed to be continued on the same conditions as previously ordered. This procedural reform will ensure important continuity of protection, particularly in domestic violence cases." 
However, Mr Craddock mounted a further argument that the appellant was on bail at the relevant time by reference to <case>(e). Section 6 deals with the various periods, from the institution to the final disposition of criminal proceedings, during which a person may be granted bail under the Act. One of those periods, specified in par (e), is that "between the lodging of an appeal and its determination, being an appeal against a conviction or order or against the severity of the person's sentence". Mr Craddock argued that, by virtue of that paragraph, the bail granted to the appellant endured until the determination of the appeal. Accordingly, as Blanch J had not completed his judgment at the time the appellant ran from the court, he was still on bail.
Again, I do not agree with that interpretation of <case>(e). Consistently with the scheme of <case> as a whole, par (e) does no more than set the outer limits of the period during which a court is empowered to grant bail in respect of an appeal. It does not mean that, in every case where bail is granted, it extends over the whole of that period.

Accordingly, I am satisfied that the appellant was not at liberty subject to a bail order at the time he ran from the courtroom. Further, when the relevant provisions are analysed, Mr Craddock's submission that the [Bail
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) provides all that is necessary for the court to discharge its functions in respect of a person who appears on bail, cannot be sustained. [Section ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s50.html) enables police officers and courts to deal with persons who have failed, or are about to fail, to comply with their bail undertakings or conditions attached to their bail, but it is by no means apparent that that section would enable any action to be taken against the present appellant. He had appeared at court in answer to his bail and was not in breach of any of his bail conditions, all of which related to his conduct prior to that appearance.
Having appeared with legal representation, and the hearing of the appeal having been embarked upon, it does not seem to me that he was in breach even of the condition to prosecute his appeal diligently.

Further, nothing in the [Bail
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) would have rendered the appellant liable to prosecution as a result of what he did. The only offence created by the Act is that provided for by <case>: failing to appear before a court in accordance with a bail undertaking. The appellant did appear in accordance with his undertaking, and it could not be suggested that s 51 extends to his absenting himself from the courtroom after the hearing had commenced.

As I have already observed, by the terms of <case> the appellant's right to remain at liberty came to an end when he appeared before the court in accordance with his bail undertaking which, at the very latest, was when the hearing of the appeal commenced. From then until the time when he absented himself, no occasion for the continuance of bail had arisen. Accordingly,
Howie DCJ's decision that the appellant was in the custody of the court at the relevant time is correct. That being so, the common law offence of escaping from lawful custody, which is expressly preserved by [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s343.html) of the [Crimes Act, ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/), was the appropriate charge, and there was a case to be left to the jury in respect of it. Once left to the jury, conviction was virtually inevitable.

As Glidewell LJ pointed out in DPP versus Richards [[1988] 1 QB 701] at 711, the custody of a court does not necessarily mean physical restraint. The English cases do not assist directly in the resolution of this appeal, because the
English [Bail
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/) expressly provides for a person appearing on bail to surrender into the custody of the court. What is apparent from Richards' case is that it may be a matter of argument exactly when that surrender takes place. In that case it was held that the respondent had done so when he reported to a court usher at an enquiry counter in response to a notice in the court building requesting him to do so. In Reg versus Central Criminal Court, Ex Parte Guney <case>; [[1996] 2
WLR 675](/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=%5b1996%5d%202%20WLR%20675 "View LawCiteRecord" ), the House of Lords held that a person on bail had surrendered when he entered pleas to a number of charges upon his arraignment at a preparatory hearing.

Equally, in New South Wales there is uncertainty as to when exactly persons on bail meet the requirement "to appear before a court", within the meaning of [s (1).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s7.html) In courts where litigants are requested to report to an officer prior to the commencement of the day's proceedings, is it at that time? Is it at the time (usually 10.00 am) when the day's proceedings begin? If the court calls through its list to determine the priority of matters to be heard, is it at that time? If it be at any time prior to the commencement of the hearing of the case, there is no difficulty in the notion that the person is in the custody of the court in the interim, and should not leave the court precincts without permission. Speaking of the time at which a person surrenders to custody under the English system, Glidewell LJ in Richards (also at 711) said: "Thereafter, albeit he may not be physically restrained, albeit he may be allowed to sit in the court concourse and visit the court canteen, he is in the custody of the court. I have already suggested that he is under an implied, if not an express obligation, not to leave the building without consent until the case is called on." 
Given that [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/s7.html) refers to a person appearing before a court (an expression used consistently throughout the Act), the preferable view may be that the bail endures until his or her case is called (whether or not the hearing proceeds then or later in the day). However that may be, there can be no doubt that a person has appeared in the relevant sense when the hearing commences, as it had in this case.

For what it is worth, I believe that criminal lawyers in this state have long understood that a person who appears at court in accordance with a bail order is then in the custody of that court. Nevertheless, I consider that the matter should be the subject of express provision in the [Bail
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ba197841/). Perhaps the
English formula of surrender into the custody of the court could be adopted, and it would be advisable for the Act to specify exactly when that surrender takes place. I consider also that the Act should spell out the consequences of a person leaving the court precincts without permission whilst in the court's custody (as does the English Act: see Richards at pp 705-6) and, if deemed appropriate, that such conduct should be the subject of a statutory offence.

I would propose that the appeal be dismissed.
