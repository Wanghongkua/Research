Should Joe Root move up to number three? Do you prefer Dawid Malan or Gary Ballance at five? And who should replace Ben Stokes?

Think you can do a better job than the England selectors? Here's your chance.

Pick your team to take on Australia in the first Ashes Test in Brisbane, which starts at 00:00 GMT on Thursday.

You have until Wednesday at 06:00 GMT to select your side. The results will be published later that day.
