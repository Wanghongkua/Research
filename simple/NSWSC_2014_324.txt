JUDGMENT
Application is made under [section 34A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/maicma1987384/s34a.html) of the [Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/maicma1987384/) (Cth) to register a restraining order issued by the Honourable Mr Justice Charles in the High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division of the United Kingdom on 17 October 2012. 
Under [s 34A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/maicma1987384/s34a.html), if a Proceeds of Crime Authority applies to a court, with proceeds jurisdiction, for registration of a foreign order in accordance with an authorisation under that subdivision of the Act, the court must register the order accordingly unless the court is satisfied it would be contrary to the interests of justice to do so. 
I am satisfied, having read the affidavit of Georgia Prior sworn 18 March 2014 and the exhibits to that affidavit, that an application has been made in accordance with an authorisation under that part of the Act and that this court has proceeds jurisdiction. 
I am also not satisfied that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to register the order.
In those circumstances, I make an order in terms of paragraph 2 of the draft order provided to me. I will stand the proceedings over to the Common Law Registrar's list on 17 July 2014 at 9am. I direct the orders be entered forthwith. The summons and the affidavit may be filed in court. * * *
