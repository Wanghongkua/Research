JUDGMENT - EX TEMPORE
HIS HONOUR: By originating process, leave to file which is sought today, the administrators of Global Bionic Optics Limited, FM-Assets Pty Limited and Infinityoptix Pty Limited seek an order pursuant to (Cth) [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 439A(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s439a.html), extending the convening period for the meeting of creditors of those companies referred to in [s 439A(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s439a.html) and (5) and pursuant to [s 447A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s447a.html), allowing the meeting of creditors to be held at any time in the extended convening period or no later than five business days after the extended convening period. But for an order under [s 439A(6)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s439a.html), the convening period will expire tomorrow 19 June 2014.
The administrators were appointed on 21 May 2014 and seek an extension of about seventy five days to 29 August 2014 on account of the time that they think will be required to implement an ordinary and orderly disposal of the assets, the time needed for proper assessment of a potential proposal for a deed of company arrangement, and difficulties in securing access to corporate financial records including those of offshore subsidiaries. 
So far as the administrators are presently aware, the companies have no secured creditors. There are no proceedings pending against the companies. There are no lessors of premises occupied or plant used by the companies. There are four employees, of whom three are directors and only one is a non-related employee. The administrators have informed ASIC of their intention to seek an extension and there has been no response. The two major unsecured creditors, who together are owed approximately sixty eight per cent of the total unsecured debt, do not oppose the application for an extension.
The major creditors have foreshadowed a proposal for a deed of company arrangement, but it is not sufficiently mature to enable it properly to be evaluated. The administrators have not yet been able to establish with any fidelity the true asset position of the companies. However, most of the assets seem to compromise intellectual property including patents, the value of which will be difficult to ascertain in the absence of a sale process.
On the material before the Court, it does not seem that there will be any significant prejudice occasioned to any person except - perhaps, the single arms length employee - from a protraction of the administration for the period sought, whereas that course will enable the administrators to make a proper assessment of the various options and an informed recommendation to creditors when the meeting is, in due course, convened.
The Court orders that: 
Upon the undertaking of Terry Paul Sperber to pay the appropriate filing fees, the administrators of Global Bionic Optics Limited, FM-Assets Pty
Limited and Infinityoptix Pty Limited have leave to file an originating process in the form initialled by me, dated this day and placed with the papers.
