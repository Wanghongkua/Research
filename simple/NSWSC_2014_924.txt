JUDGMENT
This is an application for orders under the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) . [Section 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) enables an application to be made ex parte for a restraining order which remains in force whilst there is an application pending for a proceeds assessment order under [s 27.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s27.html)
Under [s 10A(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html), the Court must make a restraining order if the order is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer who deposes to his suspicion that the Defendant has engaged in a serious crime-related activity, and that suspicion is held on reasonable grounds as the Court determines. 
The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 10 July 2014. Mr Spark deposes to his suspicion that the Defendant has engaged in a serious crime-related activity being the supply of a prohibited drug contrary to [s 25(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/) . That offence is a serious criminal offence pursuant to [s 6(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/). 
Mr Spark bases his suspicion on his inquiry through the COPS records to show that the Defendant was charged with that offence and also on his reading of a statement of facts, prepared by the police concerned with the commission of that offence. Mr Spark emailed the police officer involved in the investigation to ask if he had prepared the statement of facts, if the statement of facts were true, and if the facts contained in the statement were obtained as a result of the police's investigation into the Defendant's commission of the offences. Mr Spark received affirmative answers to all of those questions. 
I have read the statement of facts, and as a result, it seems to me that the suspicion that Mr Spark holds is a suspicion held on reasonable grounds. 
The application is made ex parte and the Court must consider whether it is appropriate, but notice ought to be given to the Defendant before the interim orders are made. I am satisfied from what Mr Spark says in his affidavit about the speed with which unregistered mortgages can be created and property disposed of, that it is appropriate that the matter be heard without giving notice to the Defendant. The Defendant has rights under [s 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10c.html) of the Act for a review of the orders. 
Upon the Plaintiff giving the usual undertaking and I note that it is given, I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 7 of the draft order. * * *
