JUDGMENT
This is an application for orders under the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) . [Section 10A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) enables an application to be made ex parte for a restraining order which remains in force whilst there is an application pending for an unexplained wealth order.
The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 27 June 2014. In that affidavit, Mr Spark deposes to his suspicion that the defendant has engaged in a serious crime related activity, namely, the supply of prohibited drugs being cannabis contrary to [s 25(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/). That is a serious criminal offence as defined in [s 6(2)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s6.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/).
The grounds on which Mr Spark holds his suspicion are set out in paragraph four of his affidavit. Mr Spark deposes to having read a statement of facts prepared by Detective Senior Constable Hubert Schwarz of the New South Wales police force. Mr Spark forwarded an email to Senior Constable Schwarz asking him if he drafted the facts sheet, if to the best of his knowledge and belief the facts were true, and if the facts sheets was prepared based on information obtained by police as a result of the investigation set out in the facts sheet. Senior Constable Schwarz answered in an email in the affirmative to all of those questions.
I am satisfied from having read the facts sheet that the suspicion that Mr Spark holds is reasonably held by him. [Section 10(5)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10.html) of the Act requires an order to be made if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion.
I am satisfied also that the defendant is domiciled in New South Wales, and that the property in respect of which the order is sought is situated in New South Wales.
[Section 10A(4)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10a.html) enables notice to be given to the defendant of this application if the court thinks fit. In the light of Mr Spark's evidence, based on his long experience in the area, concerning the speed with which property can be transferred and disposed of, I do not consider that it is appropriate to give the Defendant notice of this application in advance.
The Defendant has rights of review under [s 10C](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10c.html) of the ability.
On the plaintiff through its solicitor giving the usual undertaking as to damages, and I note that it has been given by Ms Goh, and having regard to the matters in Mr Spark's affidavit, I make the orders in paragraphs one, two, three, five, seven, and eight of the draft order, and I grant the leave and liberty contained in paras four and six.
