The Notification under section 9(1)(A) of the New South Wales [Petroleum
ACT ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/pa1991224/), appearing on page 3262 of NSW Gazette No. 79 dated the 26th of September 2014, is unconstitutional under the Commonwealth of Australia [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) and the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) of
New South Wales (1904).
 Cost of this Notice of Motion to the Plaintiff.
 Any further orders as this Honourable Court deems fit."
The orders sought were opposed by the State, other than order 6. I accordingly granted Mr Martin that leave at the hearing of the motion.
The State's position was that the motion should be stood over pending resolution of the proceedings before Hidden J. In the alternative, it submitted that paragraphs 1-5 and 7 of the motion should be dismissed, or partially stood over.

The [Vexatious Proceedings Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) litigation
The orders made by Hidden J in the [Vexatious Proceedings Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) litigation were: "1 That, pursuant to [s (7)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s8.html) of the [Vexatious Proceedings Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/), all of the proceedings in New South Wales already instituted by the defendant are stayed with the exception of the outstanding issue of costs in the Land
Environment Court proceedings 80006/2010.
 That, pursuant to [s (7)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s8.html) of the [Vexatious Proceedings Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/), the defendant be prohibited from instituting proceedings in New South Wales without the leave of this court.
 The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings."
Those orders were set aside by the Court of Appeal, on the basis of consent orders proposed by the parties, who agreed that Hidden J had erred. It was also observed at [25] - [26]: "25 In the remitted proceedings it will be necessary to make findings as to whether each of the proceedings relied on by the Attorney General satisfies the definition of "vexatious proceedings" in <case> of the VP Act. If only some of the proceedings satisfy the definition, it will then be necessary to decide whether the appellant "has frequently instituted or conducted vexatious proceedings in Australia" (s 8(1)(a)). If the answer is yes, the final question to be answered under the VP Act is whether the Court should exercise the discretion conferred by <case> to make vexatious proceedings orders against the appellant. These are issues that should be resolved by the Supreme
Court on remitter.
 There is no basis for the appellant's damages claim to be remitted or to be subject to an order for mediation. The only matter presently before this Court is the appeal from the vexatious proceedings orders. The damages claim will have to be addressed, if at all, in separate proceedings."
The reference to Mr Martin's damages claim was a reference to what was discussed at [13]: "The appellant submitted that his claim for damages against the State, which he has pursued in various proceedings, should be referred to mediation, with the mediator to submit a recommendation to the Court. If this option was not acceptable, the appellant appeared to accept that the matter should be remitted to enable the Supreme Court to resolve the outstanding issues concerning the Attorney General's application for vexatious proceedings orders. However, the appellant sought further orders relating to the matters to be canvassed on remittal including, in particular, what was said to be his claim for $500 million in damages against the State."
Mr Martin has now brought these separate proceedings to pursue that damages claim. He seeks, however, to have these proceedings dealt with at the same time as the remitted hearing of the application under the [Vexatious Proceedings Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/).
In the remitted hearing, it may also be necessary to consider the issue raised at [18] of the Court of Appeal's judgment: "It appears that no court in New South Wales has yet considered whether it is both appropriate and consistent with the rationale underlying the VP Act for the Attorney General to apply for a vexatious proceedings order against a person engaged in litigation against the State or an agency of the State. In this connection, it may be relevant that <case>(d) empowers "a person against or in relation to whom another person has instituted or conducted vexatious proceedings" to apply for an order. It may be that the Attorney General is to be regarded as in the same position as any other litigant who is the subject of vexatious proceedings and who is entitled to seek a vexatious proceedings order."
This is a reference to part heard proceedings before the Land and Environment Court, where Pain J is hearing an appeal from a decision of Commissioner Dixon given in 2011. By this motion Mr Martin seeks to have that appeal transferred to this Court to be heard together with these proceedings and the [Vexatious Proceedings Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) litigation 
It is not appropriate to stand the hearing of the motion over
Given the orders sought in the motion, it is plainly not appropriate simply to stand the hearing of the motion over until after the remittal hearing of the [Vexatious Proceedings Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) litigation, as the State proposed. Given what is sought in order 1, namely that the summons be "heard concurrently" with the remittal hearing, the effect of such an adjournment would be to refuse that order and the order seeking the transfer of the Land and Environment Court proceedings to this Court, to be heard with the [Vexatious Proceedings Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) litigation.

A concurrent hearing must be refused
Given what is in issue in the [Vexatious Proceedings Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) litigation, due to be heard on remittal in February 2015 and what is sought in the summons commencing these proceedings, I am satisfied that justice requires that the order that the summons filed in these proceedings be heard concurrently with the remittal hearing of the [Vexatious Proceedings Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) litigation and the part heard proceedings before Pain J in the Land and Environment Court must be refused.
There was no issue that the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) and the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) permit such orders to be made, but the State opposed the orders sought. Its position must be accepted in the circumstances here before the Court. 
It is quite apparent that the issues raised in the three sets of proceedings are very different. 
The [Vexatious Proceedings Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) litigation is concerned with whether Mr Martin has frequently instituted or conducted vexatious proceedings in Australia [(s 8.)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s8.html) "Vexatious proceedings" is defined in [s 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s6.html) to include proceedings that are an abuse of process; instituted to harass or annoy, to cause delay or detriment, or for another wrongful purpose; instituted or pursued without reasonable ground; or conducted in a way so as to harass or annoy, cause delay or detriment, or achieve another wrongful purpose.
In issue in these proceedings are claims that the [Vexatious Proceedings Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) litigation was instituted to pervert the course of justice. That is a matter which Mr Martin has, it appears, already raised in those proceedings and before the Court of Appeal. Mr Martin also here claims that the State and its agents acted illegally in 2009, when refusing to issue Mr Martin an exploration licence and that the State and its agencies acted, amongst other things, unconstitutionally and fraudulently, in relation to his intellectual property in the period between 2002 and 2014. Claims that the [Mining Act 1992](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ma199281/) and the [Vexatious Proceedings Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) are unconstitutional are also advanced and exemplary, special and liquidated damages in the sum of $500,000 are claimed.
The appeal proceedings before Pain J concern Commissioner Dixon's decision in relation to Mr Martin's 2009 application for an exploration license, refused by the Minister for Mineral and Forest Resources. Those proceedings are part heard. They were stayed as the result of the orders made by Hidden J. Those orders have been set aside by the Court of Appeal and there is nothing at present which precludes those proceedings being finalised. It is not, in those circumstances, appropriate to order the transfer of those proceedings to this Court. That would unquestionably involve the parties in unnecessary additional cost.
To attempt to hear all of these complex, disparate issues together in the one set of proceedings would be inconsistent with what justice requires. Contrary to Mr Martin's submissions, it is inconceivable that all of those matters could be heard together with the [Vexatious Proceedings Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) litigation listed for hearing for no more than 3 days in February. Nor would it accord with the requirements of the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/), which, it may not be overlooked, requires the Court to have regard to the overriding purpose specified in [s 56](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s56.html), the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the proceedings.
Questions of proportionality of cost and elimination of delay must also be borne in mind (see [s 59](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s59.html) and [s 60).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s60.html) The orders sought would not achieve either of those objectives. In the result, this aspect of the motion cannot succeed.

Discovery
The discovery sought may also not be permitted. 
Discovery must be relevant to a fact in issue (Rule 21.2(4)). General discovery may not be required. What is here sought is oppressive and would clearly give rise to disproportionate costs, contrary to the requirements of the [Civil Procedure Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/).
What Mr Martin seeks is discovery of all documents generated by the State and its agents since January 2007, relating to a large number of prospecting licence applications, exploration licence applications and exploration licenses, generated at Ministerial level, between the Minister and senior Departmental officers and corporations, at senior officer level, between senior and operational officers and at operational officer level.
That all of these myriads of documents could conceivably be relevant to any fact in issue in these proceedings has not been established. The cost, time, trouble and expense necessarily involved in such production is entirely unwarranted.

Subpoenas
It is premature to entertain the application for leave to issue subpoenas to give oral evidence and produce documents sought to be served on solicitors and former solicitors of the Crown solicitor's office, various Departmental officers, a former Director General and a former Minister. A similar application appears to have been made in the [Vexatious Proceedings Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) litigation.
If such an application were to be entertained in these proceedings, the documents sought to be subpoenaed would have to be identified with reasonable particularity (see Commissioner for Railways versus Small <case>; [(1938) 38 SR 564] at 573.)
Further, it is only relevant evidence, that is evidence that, "if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding" which may be accepted (s 55 of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/) ). That the various persons sought to be subpoenaed would have such evidence to give, if called, is not apparent. What might be in issue in these proceedings has not yet been identified.
In the result, this application must be refused at present, but Mr Martin given leave to renew the application, on reasonable notice being given and proper particulars of the documents sought to be produced, being provided.

Transfer of files
It is also premature to entertain this application, which seeks that various Land and Environment Court files be brought to this Court. 
A similar application appears to have been made in the [Vexatious Proceedings Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) litigation. In the first instance it is appropriate for that application to be dealt with in those proceedings, given that it is listed for hearing in February.

The hearing of the [Vexatious Proceedings Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) litigation
Those proceedings were listed for hearing in February 2015, over Mr Martin's objection. Mr Martin understood that those proceedings would be listed with these proceedings, so that he could make an application for adjournment of the February hearing.
The [Vexatious Proceedings Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) matter was not so listed, no doubt because the motion which Mr Martin filed was a motion dealing with applications which he was pressing in relation to these proceedings. It did not deal with the [Vexatious Proceedings Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) litigation. Mr Martin has not filed any motion seeking an adjournment of the hearing of that matter.
Should he wish to press such an application, he should do so in the ordinary way, by way of motion supported by an affidavit. 
Orders
Mr Martin's motion is dismissed other than the leave given in relation to order 6 and what is sought in orders 4 and 5, which is stood over. Mr Martin has leave to renew those applications on reasonable notice being given.
The usual order as to costs is that they follow the event. In this case that would be an order that Mr Martin bear the State's costs of the motion as agreed or assessed. Unless the parties approach by 20 January 2015, that will be the Court's order.
