JUDGMENT (EX TEMPORE)
HIS HONOUR: Before the Court are two related applications for orders convening a meeting of a company pursuant to (CTH) [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 411](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s411.html), and giving judicial advice in respect of trust schemes pursuant to [Trustee Act 1925](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/), [s 63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s63.html) in connection with a proposed restructure of the Westfield Group and the Westfield Retail Trusts. 
In short, what is proposed is that the Westfield Group - which presently comprises Westfield Holdings, the Westfield Trust and the Westfield America Trust - demerge its Australian and New Zealand assets; and that those assets be linked with the Australian and New Zealand assets of the Westfield Retail Trust Group under a new entity to be called Scentre, in which the present security holders in the Westfield Group, and those in the Westfield Retail Trust Group, will share in a proportion which has been determined according to the relative values of their respective current assets and interests. It is unnecessary for the purposes of this judgment to set out in detail the complex nature of what is proposed.
The order pursuant to <case> is sought in respect of Westfield Holdings, and is principally concerned with a scheme to distribute shares of Westfield Corporation Limited to Westfield Holdings shareholders. Section 411 confers on the Court a discretion to order a meeting of members of the company to be convened and to approve the applicable explanatory statement, where it is satisfied that a compromise or arrangement is proposed between a [Part 5.1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/index.html#p5.1) body and its members or any class of them, upon application made in a summary way by the body with 14 days' notice of the hearing of the application to ASIC; and if the Court is satisfied that ASIC has had a reasonable opportunity to examine the terms of the proposed compromise or arrangement and the draft of the explanatory statement, and to make submissions to the Court in relation to it. 
In this case, Westfield Holdings is a [Part 5.1](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/index.html#p5.1) body. The scheme falls within the concept of a compromise or arrangement within the meaning of <case>. Westfield Holdings has applied by way of the originating process for an order pursuant to <case>, and that process was served on ASIC more than 14 days prior to today. ASIC has indicated that it considers that it has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to examine the scheme and to make submissions. Although at this stage it reserves until the second hearing what it may say in terms of <case>(17), ASIC does not, at this stage, seek to be heard on the question of the orders to be made at this hearing. 
The factors to be taken into account in whether to make an order convening a meeting under <case> were summarised by Barrett J, as his Honour then was, in Re Westfield Holdings Ltd <case>; [(2004) 49 ACSR 734] (at 736). Important considerations, once the jurisdictional facts to which I have referred have been satisfied, are whether there will be available to members the appropriate main facts relevant to the exercise of their judgment, and whether there is any apparent reason why, if approved at the meeting, the Court would nonetheless not approve the compromise or arrangement. Of course, the Court does not substitute its business or commercial judgment for that of those with a financial interest in the company, namely, its shareholders. 
In this case, the draft Security Holder Booklet describes the scheme in what appear to be comprehensive terms, and I am influenced by the circumstance that ASIC, having had an opportunity to review it at length, does not at this stage wish to make any submissions about it. The Security Holder Booklet has been the subject of what appears to be a rigorous verification process to ensure that evidence is available to support each statement made in it. As I have indicated in the course of argument, I think it desirable that the booklet makes clear to security holders how, if they wish to oppose the proposal, they can do so, and an amendment to that effect is to be included.
There is nothing in the scheme, as revealed by the statement of facts, which would indicate at this stage that there is any fatal obstacle to its approval by the Court at the second hearing. It is unanimously supported by the Board. It does not involve the acquisition of securities by a third party bidder, and the independent expert has concluded that it is in the best interests of security holders in the absence of a superior proposal and fair for security holders. 
The requirements of Corporations Rules, r 3.2, as to who is to chair the meeting have been satisfied by affidavits of a proposed chair and alternate. 
Importantly, in the context of an independent expert's report which points out that the transaction is not a "must do" for Westfield, the "Frequently Asked Questions" portion as well as the independent expert report, fairly points out disadvantages as well as advantages associated with the proposal. Ultimately, the independent expert has concluded, as I understand it, from the perspective of the Westfield Group, that the proposal, though not a "must do", is likely to result in future benefit and financial growth for the Westfield Group, and represents a logical step in the evolution of its corporate structure in response to changing times. 
The proposal includes a provision by which ineligible foreign security holders will be cashed out, as is common in arrangements of this kind, and as courts have frequently been prepared to sanction in the past, including a deemed warranty by which each ineligible foreign security holder warrants that their shares are fully paid and unencumbered. As such clauses have now frequently been accepted, I do not think that this warrants further comment. 
Associated with the company scheme are two trust schemes relating to the Westfield Trust and the Westfield America Trust. Conformably with the practice that has evolved in respect of trust schemes that are not Part 5.1 bodies, judicial advice is sought pursuant to [Trustee Act 1925](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/), [s 63](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ta1925122/s63.html), with respect to proposed amendments to the constitution of those trusts in order to give effect to the proposal. The Court proceeds in substantially the same way and by analogy with its approach under (CTH) [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 411.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s411.html) The first matter upon which advice is sought is whether the responsible entities of the Westfield Trust and the Westfield America Trust - namely, the second plaintiff Westfield Management Limited, and the third plaintiff, Westfield America Management Limited - would be justified in convening meetings of the trust of which they are respectively the responsible entity, for the purpose of considering, and if thought fit, agreeing to special resolutions amending the constitutions of the trusts to give effect to the proposal. The matters to which I have referred in the context of the company scheme apply equally here. There does not appear to be any fatal obstacle to the Court approving the scheme at the second hearing. 
Secondly, the responsible entities seek advice that they would be justified in proceeding on the basis that the making of the proposed amendments to the constitutions of the trusts, if approved, would be within their powers as trustees, including the powers conferred by their respective constitutions and by [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 601GC.](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601gc.html) The constitutions contain plenary powers of amendment, as does [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 601GC](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s601gc.html), and there does not appear to be any basis upon which it could be said that the proposed amendments, extensive as they are, would not be within those ample powers.
Thirdly, advice is sought by the responsible entities that they would be justified in circulating an explanatory statement in the form of the draft Security Holder Booklet, which has been exhibited. This is the same explanatory memorandum as referred to in the company scheme. As I have said, the explanatory memorandum appears fully to explain the proposal, and has been the subject of a rigorous verification process. For the reasons already mentioned, subject to the one amendment I have mentioned, it seems to me that that explanatory memorandum is appropriate. 
The second application is made by RE1 Limited as responsible entity for the Westfield Retail Trust No 1, and RE2 Limited as responsible entity for Westfield Retail Trust No 2. What is proposed so far as the Westfield Retail Trust Group is concerned is that, after the separation of Westfield Group's Australian and New Zealand business from its international business and the destapling of the relevant securities of the Westfield Group, the Scentre Group will then be created. This involves a return of capital to each security holder in the Westfield Retail Trust Group, and the linking of the interests of security holders in the two Westfield Retail Trusts with the entities that will hold the former Australian and New Zealand assets of the Westfield Group so as to form a single stapled security under the Scentre Group. 
At the meeting which the Court is asked to advise the plaintiffs that they would be justified in convening, resolutions will be proposed: first, to ratify the appointment of a director, this is not a matter in respect of which the Court's advice is required or sought; secondly, to approve the proposal; thirdly and fourthly, to amend the constitutions of the two trusts; and fifthly, to terminate a Corporate Governance Deed, which will no longer be necessary following the implementation of the proposal. Again, the issues at this hearing are whether the proposals are adequately explained to the security holders and whether there is any obvious flaw in the scheme that would preclude its ultimate endorsement by the Court even if approved by the security holders. 
Once again, a comprehensive explanatory booklet has been prepared. It has been the subject of a rigorous verification process, to ensure, so far as can be done, that the statements made in it are accurate.
The booklet appears adequately to point out the disadvantages as well as the advantages of the proposal in the context of this case. That is important, because amongst the disadvantages are a significant reduction in the net tangible assets of the Westfield Retail Trust Group. The independent expert addresses that, but it is nonetheless important that that circumstance be drawn to the attention of security holders, as it is in the booklet. 
The statement of facts upon which this advice is based asserts as facts, which of course the Court assumes, that an independent board committee was constituted to consider and negotiate the proposal with the Westfield Group, and that the independent board committee excluded those Westfield Group directors who are also members of the boards of RE1 and RE2. The confidential supplement to the statement of facts indicates that robust and careful negotiations were pursued to endeavour to gain the optimum result for the security holders in the Westfield Retail Trust Group.
The independent expert has concluded that the proposal is in the interests of the security holders in the Westfield Retail Trust Group - as I understand it, essentially on the basis that there will be a significant capital return to security holders, that the merger ratio is an appropriate one having regard to the respective interests of those security holders and those in the Westfield Group, and that the proposal will remove a potential or perceived conflict of interest between the Westfield Retail Trust Group and the Westfield Group. 
Regulatory relief has been sought from the Australian Stock Exchange and from ASIC, and both have indicated, at least in principle, that such relief would be granted. Again, provision is made for the cashing out of ineligible foreign security holders and, as earlier indicated, this is no longer a particularly notable matter. 
There is no "no talk" or "no shop" or other exclusivity provision, nor any break fees. 
The constitutions of each trust contain ample powers of amendment such that the proposed amendments appear to be within those powers, notwithstanding that they are considerable in extent and go beyond the implementation of the scheme to the general updating of the trusts' constitutions. 
In proceedings 2014/94612, the Court orders that:
