PROCEDURE - application for vexatious proceedings order pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s8.html) of the [Vexatious Proceedings Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) - whether proceedings are vexatious - whether proceedings were instituted or conducted frequently - repeated re-litigation of issues determined against the defendant  
JUDGMENT
The Attorney General of New South Wales seeks orders pursuant to [s 8](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s8.html) of the [Vexatious Proceedings Act 2008](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/) that the defendant Mr Rahman be prohibited from instituting proceedings in New South Wales without leave of the Court and staying all proceedings in New South Wales already instituted by him. (All references to statutory provisions, without identifying the Act, are to this legislation.) 
Mr Rahman has instituted a large number of proceedings, both in the New South Wales and Federal jurisdictions. It was submitted by the plaintiff, generally speaking, that these proceedings demonstrated several consistent elements and themes. In many of them, Mr Rahman sought to re-litigate issues that had previously been determined. Mr Rahman also instituted proceedings to harass, annoy or achieve another wrongful purpose. Some were instituted after being ordered by the Court not to do so without first obtaining leave of the Court or a Registrar.
Furthermore, the plaintiff submits, in many cases, Mr Rahman made outrageous allegations and offensive remarks concerning members of the judiciary, members of the AAT and the ADT, government bodies, his opponents, and practitioners of the Court, all of which have been considered utterly baseless and without foundation.

The Legislative Scheme [Section 8(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s8.html) of the Act provides that a vexatious proceedings order in relation to a person may be made where an "authorised court" (such as this Court - see the definition in [s 3)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s3.html) is satisfied "the person has frequently instituted or conducted vexatious proceedings in Australia". [Section 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s4.html) of the Act defines "proceedings" as including: "(a) any cause, matter, action, suit, proceedings, trial, complaint or inquiry of any kind within the jurisdiction of any court or tribunal, and any proceedings (including any interlocutory proceedings) taken in connection with or incidental to proceedings pending before a court or tribunal, and any calling into question of a decision, whether or not a final decision, of a court or tribunal, and whether by appeal, challenge, review or in another way." [Section 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s5.html) of the Act defines "institute", in relation to proceedings, as including: "(a) for civil proceedings-the taking of a step or the making of an application that may be necessary before proceedings can be started against or in relation to a party, and for proceedings before a tribunal-the taking of a step or the making of an application that may be necessary before proceedings can be started before the tribunal, and for criminal proceedings-the making of a complaint or the obtaining of a warrant for the arrest of an alleged offender, and for civil or criminal proceedings or proceedings before a tribunal-the taking of a step or the making of an application that may be necessary to start an appeal in relation to the proceedings or to a decision made in the course of the proceedings." [Section 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s6.html) of the Act defines "vexatious proceedings", as including: "(a) proceedings that are an abuse of the process of a court or tribunal, and proceedings instituted to harass or annoy, to cause delay or detriment, or for another wrongful purpose, and proceedings instituted or pursued without reasonable ground, and proceedings conducted in a way so as to harass or annoy, cause delay or detriment, or achieve another wrongful purpose." [Section 8(7)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s8.html) of the Act provides: "The Supreme Court may make any one or more of the following vexatious proceedings orders in relation to a person: an order staying all or part of any proceedings in New South Wales already instituted by the person, an order prohibiting the person from instituting proceedings in New South
Wales, any other order that the Court considers appropriate in relation to the person."
The test under [s 8(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s8.html) requires that, before making a vexatious proceedings order, the court must first be satisfied that the person has instituted or conducted vexatious proceedings as defined in [s 6](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s6.html) and then that those proceedings have been instituted or conducted frequently (see: Attorney General of NSW versus Wilson <case> per Davies J at [10] - <case>, Davies J helpfully (if I may respectfully say so) set out the relevant principles as follows - " <case> at <case>- <case> the principles associated with the making of an order under [s (1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/s8.html) of the Act. Those matters may be summarised as follows: the test of "frequently" is a less demanding test than was required under s 84 [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/); the term "frequently" is a relative term and must be looked at in the context of the litigation being considered; the number of proceedings considered may be small if the proceedings are an attempt to re-litigate an issue already determined against the person; regard may be had to applications made by the person in proceedings commenced against that person; regard may be had to the way the person has behaved and conducted himself or herself in the proceedings before the Court; regard may be had to proceedings in any Australian court or tribunal; regard may be had to the findings and result in the proceedings under consideration.
 [8] In these proceedings, reference has been made to the judgment of Perram J in Official Trustee in Bankruptcy versus Gargan (No 2) <case> where his Honour eloquently expresses the principles relating to vexatious litigants at [2]-[12]. Whilst acknowledging that the test his Honour had to consider was the test under <case> [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) and is, as I have noted, a more demanding test than is required under the [Vexatious
Proceedings Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/vpa2008252/), much of what his Honour sets out is relevant to the determination in the present case.
 [2] A comprehensive explanation of what makes a proceeding vexatious is difficult to proffer for the boundary between the persistent and over-zealous on the one hand, and the vexatious on the other, may at times be indistinct.
However, the following principles are, at least, well-established. First, the making of such an order is an extreme remedy depriving its object of recourse to the enforcement of the law which is every citizen's ordinary right. It is, therefore, not lightly to be made.
 [3] Secondly, the purpose of the order is not to impose condign punishment for past litigious misdeeds; it serves instead to shield both the public, whose individual members might be molested by vexatious proceedings, and the
Court itself, whose limited resources and needs must be carefully managed and protected from the expense, burden and inconvenience of baseless and repetitious suits.
 [4] Thirdly, as might naturally be expected, such a severe power is not enlivened by the mere single occurrence of a vexatious claim. To err is human and transient lapses of judgment, even serious ones, may be found in the most reasonable of places. Instead, the power to make the order is conditional upon the litigant having commenced not only a single vexatious proceeding but also upon having commenced similar such proceedings in this Court or in other
Australian courts.
 [5] Fourthly, the qualities of vexation to which O 21 is addressed are to be found, as the terms of r 1(1) show, in the commencement by the litigant of proceedings which lack reasonable grounds and where the litigant's institution of such proceedings may fairly be said to be both habitual and persistent.
 [6] Fifthly, whether a proceeding is instituted without reasonable grounds is a different question to, although not wholly disconnected from, the inquiry into a proceeding's legal merits. The wheat, no doubt, must be separated from the chaff but in this area the question is whether what is before the Court contains any wheat at all. Although, often enough, no great guidance is obtained by exchanging one formula of words with another, it will be usually of some assistance, limited perhaps, to ask whether the issues brought to the
Court for determination are manifestly hopeless or devoid of merit. It is, in that context, important to distinguish the difficult from the ridiculous and the unlikely from the hopeless.
 [7] Sixthly, although the ways in which unreasonable grounds may manifest themselves are myriad, one form often to be found in the baggage of the vexatious is a failure, often a refusal, to understand the principles of finality of litigation which rescue court and litigant alike from a Samsara of past forensic encounters.
 [8] Seventhly, it is the related quality of repetition which underpins, in part, a need for the institution of the proceedings to deserve the appellations habitual and persistent. The litigant's conduct will be habitual where the commencement of proceedings occurs as a matter of course when appropriate conditions for their commencement are present as was explained by
Roden J in Attorney-General versus Wentworth [(1988) 14 NSWLR 481] at 492.
That formulation may not wholly explain the litigant who commences proceedings on any occasion and without the presence of any conditions, whether appropriate or otherwise. In such cases, the idea of constant repetition driven by habit and symptomatic of an inability not to engage in the behaviour may be more useful. Persistence, on the other hand, generally suggests stubborn determination but, in the context of the vexatious, carries with it the capacity to endure failure beyond the point at which a rational person would abandon the field.
 [9] Eighthly, each of these notions - the want of reasonable grounds, habitual institution and persistent institution - are to be gauged objectively. But this does not mean that a litigant's own protestation as to his or her own mental state is irrelevant; frequently enough, the vexatious are betrayed out of their own mouths. Rather, the need for objective determination protects courts from the vexatious litigant who is genuinely, but misguidedly, persuaded as to the correctness of his or her own conduct.
 [10] Ninthly, the power to make the order arises when proceedings commenced in the way described are found to exist. But the notion of a proceeding is a broad one including a substantive proceeding directed at the attainment of final relief and collateral applications within such a proceeding; further, it extends outside the proceeding itself and embraces appeals therefrom and applications which, whilst not made in the proceeding, are properly to be seen as collateral thereto - so much flows from the definition of proceeding in [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fcoaa1976249/s4.html) of the [Federal Court of Australia Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fcoaa1976249/) (Cth).
 ...
 [12] Finally, once it is concluded that the Court's power to prevent a litigant from commencing or pursuing proceedings has been enlivened, the considerations germane to the exercise of that power are unconfined. However, the factors which will be relevant are informed by the protective purpose which the order serves. Where a litigant displays insight into their previous litigious history this will, no doubt, be relevant for it will suggest - although not determine - a diminution in the risk posed to the public. On the other hand, the manner in which a litigant conducts herself in her affairs generally is also capable of throwing light on whether the commencement of further vexatious proceedings is likely. Those general affairs include the litigant's defence to the proceedings by which the order restraining him is sought. Because of the protective nature of the jurisdiction it is also relevant to know the extent of the damage and inconvenience the litigant's forays into the courts have caused, pecuniary or otherwise." 
The evidence
The plaintiff read the affidavit of Sophie Jaggard affirmed on 2 May 2012 and two affidavits of Lisa So affirmed on 29 October 2012 and 27 November 2012. Each of these affidavits exhibited copies of files, transcripts and judgments of various courts and tribunals.
Mr Rahman filed submissions on 21 August 2012 and also, with leave of the Court, made further written submissions. The plaintiff contends (rightly) that the submissions filed on 21 August 2012 are inadmissible, but was content for them to be considered in the application subject, of course, to weight.

The defendant's litigation history
In determining whether to make the orders sought by the plaintiff, it is first necessary to determine whether, if any, of the proceedings which the plaintiff points to as being vexatious are such and then to further determine whether they have been frequently instituted or conducted. In so doing, I have reviewed the proceedings pointed to by the plaintiff as demonstrative of the defendant's litigation history. It is necessary to focus on the nature of the defendant's claim in each case, the outcome of individual proceedings and the findings of or views expressed by the presiding judicial officer in determining the proceedings, the conduct of the defendant within the proceedings and the attitude or perceived attitude of the defendant towards his obligations as unsuccessful litigant. 
I have set out in some instances, Mr Rahman's pleadings and submissions. These have mostly been reproduced in their original form. 
Mr Rahman has undertaken proceedings in this State in various courts and tribunals, the Federal Court and the High Court. My approach has been to deal with the former category first, in chronological order, up to the applications for special leave in the High Court, and then the Federal Court proceedings.
Mr Rahman made extensive written submissions in this proceeding. They deal, directly or indirectly, with the particular cases or decisions relied on by the plaintiff, sometimes in general language that, so far as I can discern, is intended to apply to all those matters. I have quoted some parts of these submissions to demonstrate what Mr Rahman wishes to say about the litigation but I have not set out the entirety: they are rambling, repetitive and, on occasions, incomprehensible. However, I have given careful consideration to everything he has said. It is fair, I think, to characterise them as a robust defence of his conduct in commencing and maintaining every piece of litigation to which the plaintiff has referred. That defence has included not only insisting that each adverse decision was wrong, not only for legal reasons but also was motivated by bias against him, incompetence and, in some cases corruption. 
The NSW Litigation - 
The language test proceedings
This litigation arose out of the one event. Mr Rahman was a schoolteacher in Bangladesh and had also been a teacher in the United Kingdom. In Australia, the defendant applied to the Department of Education and Training (the Department) to become a teacher in New South Wales. His first application was made on 25 July 1991. This application was refused on the basis that he did not hold the requisite qualifications. Mr Rahman's fresh application to the Department in 1999 was refused. In April 2001, he applied again and was told that he would be required to undertake an assessment of his English language proficiency through the Professional English Assessment for Teachers Programme (PEAT Programme) administered through the Institute of Languages (operated by New South Global Pty Limited, owned by the University of New South Wales). He was employed on a conditional basis to teach casually, pending the successful completion of the test. He was unsuccessful. 
On 7 January 2002, Mr Rahman wrote a letter of complaint to the Anti-Discrimination Board alleging that his low score on the test in October 2001 was the result of racial bias on the part of the examiners or the criterion used for assessment was racially biased against him. On or about 14 November 2002, this complaint was rejected by the Anti-Discrimination Board, with the President of the Board observing "his complaint presents less than a remote possibility of merit and should therefore be declined as misconceived and lacking in substance under <case> of the NSW [Anti-Discrimination Act, 1977](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/)" (Rahman versus New South Global Pty Ltd <case> Mr Rahman requested that his complaint be referred to the Administrative Decisions Tribunal.

Rahman versus New South Global Ltd (EOD) <case>
In the Administrative Decisions Tribunal, Mr Rahman appealed a number of preliminary decisions of the Equal Opportunity Division of the Tribunal These concerned a refusal to grant an adjournment, the referral of the matter to mediation without consent, representation of New South Global by a solicitor, Ms Kirby, not dealing appropriately with non-production of documents and bias of the judicial member, Mr Innes. The Reasons of the ADT Appeal Panel of 7 October 2003 dealt with each of these points and held they were not made out. The appeal was accordingly dismissed. 
In the result, the refusal to adjourn was not pressed except in relation to allegations of bias. As to the mediation, not only had Mr Rahman not objected to it, he participated in it. At all events, his consent was not necessary. Since leave had implicitly been granted for Ms Kirby to appear, she was entitled to do so. The grant of leave, moreover, was not an appellable decision. As to the documents, they had either all been produced or a satisfactory explanation for their absence given, as Mr Rahman had expressly conceded. As to bias, Mr Rahman simply relied on decisions he regarded as adverse, but which the Appeal Tribunal regarded as correct. 
The plaintiff submits that this proceeding was vexatious as having no real prospects of success; the non-production of documents claim was without substance and was an abuse of process; and the allegation of bias lacked any reasonable basis. 
Rahman versus New South Global Ltd (Administrative Decisions Tribunal , Innes G - Judicial Member, 7 November 2003, unrep) 
The decision of 7 November 2003 was by the Equal Opportunity Division of the ADT and dealt with the substantive issues involved in the plaintiff's appeal to that body. It is apparent from the reasons that evidence was given by the plaintiff, a Kathleen Lane and a Dr Jill Murray. The Tribunal also had before it a number of documents including the assessments made by various markers who had marked the plaintiff's test. The Tribunal made findings as to this evidence and concluded that there was no basis for the plaintiff's allegations of discrimination and dismissed his complaint.

Rahman versus New South Global Pty Ltd <case>
Mr Rahman appealed the 7 November 2003 decision of the Tribunal on grounds which included many of the issues which had already been decided by the Appeal Panel on 7 October 2003. Noting this fact, the Appeal Panel said, "... We told Mr Rahman during the ... hearing that he is not entitled to re-agitate those matters before this Panel ... His only option is to appeal to the Supreme Court, if he is still entitled to do so". Mr Rahman's submission that the presiding member of the Appeal Panel, Magistrate Hennessy, should disqualify herself as she had also presided over the Appeal Panel that made the decision of 7 October to dismiss that appeal was rejected. Three other grounds were relied on: the respondent had been wrongly named; the Tribunal (Mr Innes) was biased; and insufficient reference had made to the facts and the law. Each of these grounds were considered and rejected. In relation to the bias ground, the Appeal Panel noted that "a similar submission was rejected by the Appeal Panel in Rahman versus New South Global Ltd (EOD) <case> at <case> to [32]" (the 7 October 2003 decision). Mr Rahman's fresh allegation was that a "subtle inner subconscious revengeful mind has worked in Mr Innes' mind". A submission as to Ms Kirby representing New South Global was rejected as misconceived and, at all events, as having been dealt with by the earlier Appeal Panel decision. Mr Rahman's further submissions alleging errors of fact, amounting to seeking a merits review, were rejected and he failed to identify any error of law. Further submissions were characterised as "wholly irrelevant to the question of whether the Tribunal made an error of law". 
The plaintiff contends that this was a vexatious proceeding as the matters sought to be litigated had already been determined by the Tribunal and the application for Magistrate Hennessey to disqualify herself were without reasonable grounds.

Rahman versus New South Global Pty Ltd <case>
Mr Rahman filed a summons on 3 December 2004 in the Supreme Court appealing the ADT decisions of 7 October 2003, 7 November 2003 and 5 November 2004 (this last being the only appeal within time). Mr Rahman filed two Notices of Motion, the first to amend the name of the respondent, the second seeking orders for contempt of court (for non-production of documents) as well as damages, aggravated damages and exemplary damages. The respondent, New South Global filed a Notice of Motion seeking summary dismissal of the proceedings. 
The summons was summarily dismissed: Rahman versus New South Global Pty Ltd <case> Hulme J concluded, as to each matter decided by the Appeal Panel on 5 November 2004, that none demonstrated any error of law. His Honour also concluded that leave to extend time to appeal from the decision of 7 October 2003 should be refused: it concerned only interlocutory matters and was at all events doomed to fail. There could be no appeal from the decision of 7 November 2003, since it was not a decision of the Appeal Panel: [s 119](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/aa1977204/s119.html) [Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act 1997](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/adta1997348/) . 
The Notice of Motion seeking orders for contempt and damages was also dismissed: Rahman versus Institute of Languages New South Global Pty Ltd (Supreme Court , Hulme J, 28 November 2005, unrep). Hulme J found that there was no evidence of personal service of the subpoena, non-compliance with which was alleged to be the basis for the defendant's contempt. There was, at all events, no evidence produced by Mr Rahman capable of establishing any contempt, in particular that the defendant was in possession of the documents to which the subpoena referred. 
It was submitted by the plaintiff that this proceeding was vexatious: it had no prospects of success; Mr Rahman sought to re-litigate matters that had already been determined and sought relief that was not relevant to the cause of action. Mr Rahman had also sought to initiate private criminal proceedings in order to harass or annoy. 
Rahman versus Institute of Languages, New South Wales Global Pty Limited (Court of Appeal , Ipp JA, 6 February 2006, unrep)
On 6 February 2006 Mr Rahman sought a stay of the order of Hulme J. The application came before Ipp JA. The nature of Mr Rahman's application can be gathered from his opening oral submission - "What happens, this proceeding originates in 2001 and I have evidence with the legal things of the documents but due to my racial backgrounds the arbitrators - the justice, the Supreme Court, they have made an error, abused the process, the justice devolved from the facts and findings and it appears that all the decisions there was an error of law, ... (not transcribable) ..., corruption practices ... (not transcribable) ... and abuse of all relevant acts and I have challenged in all locations since the proceedings started in lower courts and ended in here. And I have challenged the decisions of Hulme J on three days and I having 160 documents and I have all these exhibits give to him. All the laws he has abused it, I have challenged him that I'll take this matter to the High Court and it appears that the parties in the proceedings and the lady whose decisions have lost the job was doing corruption practices and bribery practices. I have given evidences with supporting documents. Even the justice of the courts they are tempted with the bribes. I have given all the documents but nothing happens because my social background. All discriminated. ... So I need stay of the proceedings because prejudice, justice was injustice and I believe that is because the judicial members is biased and corruptions. I don't know how big size the money they provided at the corruption practices -
I haven't any evidence at the moment but I'll prove at the High Court the judicial member Hulme with Mr Howie." 
Ipp JA, in a brief ex tempore judgment, refused the stay. He pointed to Mr
Rahman's statement that he had no evidence as to the serious issues for determination of the appeal and to his not having addressed the question of prejudice.

Rahman versus New South Global Pty Ltd (Supreme Court , Giles and Bryson JJA, 3 August 2006, unrep)
This proceeding was an application for leave to appeal (Giles and Bryson JJA) the decisions of Hulme J. Mr Rahman objected to the application being heard by only two judges and, in particular, objected to Bryson JA, claiming that he had "no confidence" in his Honour. He submitted that Bryson JA had not challenged his legal argument in the course of his submissions in another appeal; Rahman versus Director-General Department Of Education & Training <case>, heard by Mason P, Handley and Bryson JJA, in which Handley and Bryson JJA agreed with the President. Mr Rahman stated - "[Y]our Honour being a member of the appeal panel you have obligations to uphold a matter of justice but you fail to do that but you show a favour to your social class, you abuse the Acts. You owe to Her Majesty the Queen to uphold the justice by the legislation and evidences and it ask you - you fail to do that absolutely. Not only you the whole panel members. You absolutely, absolutely fail to challenge my submissions... The whole honourable judges they become blind to the laws and acts." 
Mr Rahman continued - "As a part time employee I have challenged in the High Court what they have done in the judicial systems - the Judges decide on social class... I have made a strong submission to your Honour how ridiculous, how they abuse the laws to certain social class." ...

BRYSON JA: Do you say that I abused the law -- 
CLAIMANT: Yes.

BRYSON JA: -- with respect to the interests of a certain social class? 
CLAIMANT: Yes indeed you haven't looked at the lot." 
Mr Rahman also said - "...[Y]ou [Bryson JA] failed to act according to the law and you failed to uphold - denial of natural justice both evidences and the Acts. You failed to understand or if you have understanding everything but you have abused the process.
Mr Rahman made other serious allegations - "Industrial Relations Commissions, they bribe the judges. I have given documents. In ADT, they bribe. They didn't follow the provision. Here, Hulme
J, contempt of the Court - what did happen, no, there's no document ... There is no existence of examination but bribery practices. There is corruption practice in the Crime Act [sic], nothing happened, nothing happened ... I personally submitted my applications. It's just contempt of the court, not only Supreme Court but in other courts, but yes, is lot of money. I have given the documents. Justice stop. Because there's big party. They have millions of dollars. They can buy the judges as it happens in other parts of the world, but my person is that, who gives evidences is only - how a judge can give evidence to a party."
The Court, dismissing the application with costs, stated (in a very brief judgment) - "Nothing that Mr Rahman has said indicates to us any basis for error on the part of Hulme J warranting the grant of leave to appeal." 
Rahman versus Institute of Languages New South Global Pty Limited [[2007] HCA Trans 174]
On 27 April 2007 Mr Rahman applied for special leave in the High Court to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision, which was refused. Gummow J commented - "Much of the applicant's complaint about those decisions was legally misconceived and doomed to fail, and Hulme J was correct to dismiss the application... [T]here was no substance to his complaints about the composition of the bench in [the Court of Appeal] ...The applicant's draft notice of appeal in this Court is largely unintelligible and is embarrassing in the technical sense. There would be no prospect of success on any appeal to this Court against the orders of the Court of Appeal."
The plaintiff submits that these were vexatious proceedings as being doomed to fail. 
The unfair dismissal proceedings
Mr Rahman was provided with the opportunity to re-take the language test, but did not and so lost the approval to teach. Mr Rahman took the matter to the Industrial Relations Commission.

Rahman and NSW Director-General of Education & Training <case>
Mr Rahman made an application under [s 84](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s84.html) of the [Industrial Relations Act 1996](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/) claiming that the termination of his employment amounted to a "harsh, unreasonable or unjust dismissal". He raised the issue of discrimination in relation to his applications for employment since 1991. The Commission dismissed the proceedings on 3 June 2004, noting that the application was out of time and commenting - "[Mr Rahman] submitted forcefully in the proceedings there was no need for him to undertake the PEAT examination, given matters such as the nature of his tertiary studies, earlier English language accreditation and employment history in English-speaking countries. He also forcefully challenged the bases upon which an employment condition concerning the PEAT examination could be imposed upon him, adverting in this respect to a wide range of policy-related considerations and statutory provisions. Few of the statutory provisions referred to in the applicant's submissions were relevant to the determination of the two threshold issues...

I accept the respondent's contention that the termination of employment was not such as would attract the unfair dismissals jurisdiction of Ch2 Pt6 of the
Act...

Despite the applicant's view that the application was made within time, the evidence and submissions lead, inexorably in my view, to the conclusion the application was made outside the timeframe of 21 days specified in [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s85.html) of the Act. The applicant was resolute in his opinion that the application had been filed within time and, for that reason, declined to advance any reasons at all why the application should be accepted out of time."
The plaintiff submitted that as the application was out of time and Mr Rahman did not provide reasons as to why the matter should proceed despite being out of time, it was vexatious. 
Rahman and NSW Director-General of Education and Training in the State of NSW <case>
Mr Rahman appealed the <case> proceedings and sought to summons 31 witnesses for the appeal. The respondent filed a notice of motion to set the summonses aside, which was upheld by Staff J on 24 September 2004. On 27 September 2004 Mr Rahman filed a notice of motion seeking to adduce fresh evidence, being from the 31 witnesses and argued that his case was not heard on its merits and the 31 witnesses will assist his case. The Commission stated in relation to the <case> proceedings - [10] ... [I]t is patently obvious that the appellant misunderstood what the
Commissioner was required to determine. So much is evident from the reasons for this notice of motion ...
 [11] It must be reiterated that the merits of the appellant's case have not, at any stage, been determined. It follows that the appeal is confined to what the Commissioner decided and not the merits of the appellant's case.
 "[12] ... [It [Decline[d] to admit further evidence 'as it would not have 'further[ed] a determination of the essential issue' on appeal'. It follows, in our view, that special grounds do not exist for the admission of further evidence ..."
The plaintiff submits that this was a vexatious proceeding in that the notice of motion was doomed to fail and, as well, that it sought to re-litigate matters that had already been determined by Staff J, which were not the subject of the appeal.

Rahman and Director-General NSW Department of Education and Training <case>
This proceeding was the substantive appeal of the <case> decision. It was heard on 15 October 2004 and judgment was handed down on 3 December 2004. The Full Bench concluded that the first instance Commissioner was correct in not determining the matter on the merits. The Full Bench noted that Mr Rahman "filed a significant amount of material, the bulk of which went to the merits of his case. [Mr Rahman] spoke to his submissions on 15 October 2004, but did not raise any relevant issues in addition to the material he had earlier filed."
The Full Bench first determined whether the learned Commissioner was correct in not granting leave for the application by Mr Rahman to be heard out of time - "[19] In our view, the Commissioner's exercise of discretion in considering the out of time application was correct and is beyond challenge...
 [20] It follows that it is unnecessary to resolve the question of jurisdiction being whether a dismissal of Mr Rahman occurred on either 4 July 2003 or 28
August 2003 because if the application is out of time and leave to extend time is not granted, there is no appeal. This is not to say the Commissioner was wrong. It is unnecessary, in light of the decision which we have reached, to express any view on this aspect of the appeal and we decline to do so."
The plaintiff claimed that this proceeding was vexatious as it was doomed to failure and that Mr Rahman refused even to deal with the issue that his application may be out of time (despite the earlier decision) and lead evidence on this issue. The plaintiff contends that the proceedings were clearly out of time.

Rahman versus Director-General Department of Education and Training <case>
A summons was filed by Mr Rahman on 4 January 2005 in the Supreme Court, which transferred the matter to the Court of Appeal, where he sought leave to appeal, and to appeal the decisions made in the Industrial Relations Commission on 3 June, 24 September, 12 October and 3 December 2004. The Registrar directed that an amended summons be filed and served by 5 April 2005. This was not done, but Mr Rahman filed affidavits and a Notice of Appeal was annexed to one. The Registrar ultimately ordered - "[7] If the claimant wishes to bring summons claiming relief pursuant to [s.48(2)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ira1996242/s48.html) of [Supreme Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) then such an Amended Summons must be filed and served on or before 06/05/05. In default of which these proceedings are struck out as an abuse of process."
On 26 April 2005 Mr Rahman filed a notice of motion seeking for this order to be set aside and relied upon an affidavit. Hodgson JA, dismissing the notice of motion on 9 May 2005, stated - [8] ... [The claimant's affidavit] did not set out any evidence in admissible or understandable form, but ... was received as an indication of the claimant's understanding of the basis on which he seeks to challenge the IRC decisions.
 ...
 [14] ... In my opinion, the claimant has not advanced any reasonable ground for thinking that Registrar Schell's decision was incorrect, nor has he advanced, in my opinion, any reasonable basis for thinking he should, by way of variation of Registrar Schell's order, be given a further opportunity to bring proceedings seeking prerogative relief. The material he has put before the Court does not give any grounds for thinking that this may be a case which could fall within the Supreme Court's very limited jurisdiction over IRC proceedings.
 ...
 [17] On the material before me, the claimant's proceedings are an abuse of process in form and in substance. So, for those reasons, in my opinion, the
Notice of Motion should be dismissed, and that is the order I make."
The plaintiff submits that this was a vexatious proceeding as it had no prospects of success, the Court (as quoted above) stated that the proceedings were "an abuse of process in form and in substance" and that, as the proceedings were undertaken to avoid filing the amended summons, was instituted "in such a way as to harass or annoy, cause delay or detriment, or achieve another wrongful purpose".

Rahman versus Director-General Department of Education & Training <case>
Mr Rahman appealed from the 9 May 2005 decision of Hodgson JA. On 22 August 2005 the appeal was set down for delivery of judgment. Mason P (sitting with Handley and Bryson JJA) informed Mr Rahman that the Court did not have jurisdiction in the matter and proposed to dismiss the appeal. His Honour commenced to give reasons. Mr Rahman interrupted to make some points about the initiating process. The President allowed him to file an application for an order seeking leave to appeal from the decision of Hodgson JA and then proceeded to give judgment on the substantive issue, which concerned the limited jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to consider appeals from the Industrial Relations Commission. In the course of his judgment, the President said - "[29] There have been some very general allegations in the written submissions and in the oral submissions to the effect that the Commissioners were not properly appointed, or that there was gross dereliction of duty or even corruption. Those are very serious allegations that would require the clearest of evidence. Nothing in the material that has been put before this Court indicates that there is any substance in those allegations."
Mason P (Handley and Bryson JJA agreeing) concluded that the Court had no jurisdiction to deal with the matter and stated - "[31] In my view, there is a need to put an end to this litigation because of the jurisdictional problem and the absence of any substance in it."
The plaintiff contends that this proceeding was vexatious as it had no prospects of success, it sought to re-litigate issues that had already been determined and Mr Rahman "made very serious allegations without putting any material that would substantiate those allegations", which the plaintiff claimed was to harass or annoy.

Rahman versus Director-General of Dept of Education and Training <case>
Mr Rahman then sought special leave to appeal to the High Court (Gummow and Heydon JJ). On 12 April 2006 this was refused. Gummow J stated - "The applicant's special leave application to this Court is embarrassing, vexatious, abusive and very difficult to follow. It is not directed to the two reasons given by McKenna C for dismissing the original application, and it does not expose any error of jurisdiction. It has no prospects of success."
It was submitted by the plaintiff that, for the reasons given, this proceeding was vexatious. 
The challenge to English tests
In 2009 Mr Rahman sought also to challenge his failing the PEAT test by taking proceedings in this Court against Peter Riordan, Deputy Director-General and David McGrath, Manager Teacher, NSW Department of Education and Training. 
Rahman versus Riordan (Supreme Court , McCallum J, 15 April 2010, unrep)
Mr Rahman had sought leave to issue a number of subpoenas in connection with the hearing of this appeal. On 30 March 2010 Davies J had refused leave to appeal from the decision of the Registrar refusing to issue the subpoenas. On 7 April 2010 Mr Rahman, by Notice of Motion, sought to review the decision of Davies J. Mr Rahman submitted that the Registrar and Davies J had misconstrued [s 68](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s68.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/), since the section permitted subpoenas to be issued in respect of "any person", that the decision of Tomko versus Palasty (No 2) <case>, should not have been followed and lastly, he was denied procedural fairness because Davies J did not require counsel who appeared for the defendants to produce any document proving that he was a barrister. McCallum J rejected each of these submissions and dismissed the application with costs.

Rahman versus Riordan <case> 
Mr Rahman sought orders in the nature of mandamus against Messrs Rordan and McGrath. On 20 April 2010 McClellan CJ at CL in an ex tempore judgment dismissed the summons with costs. His Honour noted (at [24]) that Mr Rahman had failed in earlier proceedings in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Mr Rahman "complain[ed] that the relevant officers of the Department have acted contrary to law and that he is entitled to relief from this court in the nature of mandamus ordering the Department to employ him as a teacher". His Honour held that Mr Rahman was not entitled to relief (at [29]) and stated that he was not persuaded that the Department had acted contrary to law and that there was "nothing ... to indicate that the decision which was made by the Department to require the PEAT assessment in the plaintiff's case was made otherwise than in accordance with the procedures adopted by the Department" (at [30]). His Honour further commented [at 31] that Mr Rahman had "been treated no differently to hundreds of other persons who have gained their qualifications overseas and are of non-English speaking backgrounds". 
It was submitted by the plaintiff that this proceeding was vexatious as it sought to re-litigate issues that had already been determined.
Mr Rahman devotes some seven or so pages of his written submissions to this matter. Though the language is awkward, the thrust is clear enough. A sufficient sample is as follows - "[10] ... P D McClellan ... hesitated to his social class to validate the applicant's claim that the DET Officials are in continuous practice of corruption of bribery of millions of dollars with the higher authority in the name of :'False English Test - 'Professional English Assessment for Teachers -
PEAT for Employment of teachers whom have Teaching qualifications from 'Not in
English medium of Learning and Teaching". [No such terminology of 'Professional English Assessment for Teachers; - PEAT Course are offered by any Professional Institutes in the World under and Charter of Instruments].
 ...
 [20] The facts also that that Peter Rordan, Deputy-Director-General, and David
McGrath, Manager, Teacher, NSW Department of Education and Training both of them in doing such act of decision exceeded power and has misconstrued not only the provisions of above mentioned provisions of enactments but also all the false claims about the false Professional English Assessment for Teachers when 'in witness box both of them failed to defend the existence of PEAT with the unlawful use and Practice of the name of the University of New South Wales where it is New South Global Pty - a private company and absolutely failed to produce any Subpoena documents 1-8 & 1-7 and Reg 33.12 Failure to comply with subpoena - contempt of Court, UCPR. But Justice McClellan showed indulgence to his Social Class as a form of "Judicial racism" to the
Applicant in such procedures (Annex H).
 [21] ... Justice Peter David McClellan' misconstrued all the provisions of the laws that are required for the interpretations, applications with documentary evidences under enactments of legislations and related International concurrence of law of 'jurisprudence for the discharge and to upheld the truthfulness of administration of justice in this proceedings. But His decisions are infatuated with his own Social passion of lineage for the "Peter

 "A decision-maker falls into jurisdictional error if he or she misunderstands the nature of the jurisdiction to be exercised, misconceives his or her duty, fails to apply himself or herself to the question to be decided, or misunderstands the nature of the opinion which he or she is to form": per
Gaudron J in Re Patterson; ex parte Taylor [(2001) 182 ALR 657] at [82]."
As I understand him, Mr Rahman maintains that he is the victim of unlawful decisions based, at least in part, upon his ethnic origins and a conspiracy, which includes the judges, against persons in his social and cultural situation. His claims about PEAT and his unjustified treatment are true and the decision of McClellan CJ at CL is rejected as actuated by bias. It is not altogether clear, but "Annex 8" appears to be a reference to "PART EIGHT" in the written submissions, which commences as follows - "Under the above submission it is evident that the NSW Judicature has transformed into a "institutional mafia" and its employed judicial members (except few - Hon David Kirby L, NSW, & Hon Schinder J, Brisbane) as judicial mafias and doing a continuous practice of "crimes against humanity" as practiced with the Applicant as well as other social class, ethnic and racial group against the unlawful and transgress decisions by the Officials,
Government Departments, (Both State and Commonwealth) as did with the
Aborigines whom took away from those classes the property, children and other belongs in favour of them in the name of justice (Document enclosed)." 
This theme is elaborated in successive paragraphs, concluding with the following - "In submitting such Dictum of Statutory and substantive law' the Defendant is seeking order for himself and on behalf of common citizens of the Australia [whom have constrain of access to the judiciary is such right issues] that
Your Hon with frustrate and prohibit such notions of "encroachment of Human
Dignity" by Gregory Smith [the Attorney-General] for serious crimes of concern to the Defendant and other Ethnic Citizens of distinct educational, socio- cultural and religious affiliations and as well did with the Aborigines by
Australian Judiciary for centuries - Crimes of "Stolen Generation" legalise for penalty and took over their wealth, pecuniary and property ownership by the Judiciary's identical pronouncements/judgments are nothing but absolutely crimes as well as to the whole international community."
Mr Rahman filed an application for leave to appeal against the decision of McClellan CJ at CL. It was dismissed with costs on 23 September 2010 by Giles JA and Sackville AJA. The plaintiff submits that this proceeding was vexatious, but was unable to locate the transcript. The submission was based on the subsequent judgments of the Court of Appeal as well as the Application for Special Leave to appeal to the High Court.
Mr Rahman in the present proceedings submits that [s 101(1)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s101.html) of the [Supreme Court Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) and [s 78(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s78.html) of the [Judiciary Act 1903](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth) had been "transgressed" by Giles JA and Sackville AJA.

Rahman versus Riordan <case>
On 20 October 2010 Mr Rahman filed a Notice of Motion in the Court of Appeal seeking to set aside the orders made by Giles JA and Sackville AJA on 23 September 2010. Amongst other issues raised by Mr Rahman, he objected to the motion being heard by two judges. As noted earlier Mr Rahman had unsuccessfully put this argument in another proceeding (Rahman versus New South Global Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA (3 August 2006). He also requested remittal of the matter to Giles JA and Sackville AJA to enable them to reconsider their refusal of leave to appeal, failing, however, to to provide any sensible reasons why that should occur. Allsop P dismissed the Notice of Motion with costs on 1 November 2010.
The plaintiff contends that these proceedings were vexatious on the basis that they had no real prospects of success.

Rahman versus Riordan <case> 
On 15 November 2010 Mr Rahman filed a notice of motion seeking to have the orders of 23 September 2010 and the orders of Allsop P on 1 November 2010 set aside. The motion was heard by Tobias, Macfarlan JJA and Handley AJA on 16 December 2010. Macfarlan JA (Tobias JA and Handley AJA agreeing) held (at [3]) that the President was "plainly correct" in his view that he did not have the power to set aside the judgment of Giles JA and Sackville AJA and (at [4]) noted that the President was also correct regarding the number of judges on that application as also (at [5]) on the question of remittal. Mr Rahman also claimed that the President heard his Notice of Motion as the "referrals judge" which Mr Rahman claimed to invalidate his Honour's decision. Macfarlan JA dismissed both appeals, noting (at [10]) the matters agitated by Mr Rahman "do not in my view have any substance". Tobias JA added at [12] that Mr Rahman "agreed that on 19 October 2010 he filed an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court ... against the orders of Giles JA and Sackville AJA refusing him leave to appeal against the decision of the primary judge" which, his Honour noted, would be an added reason why the Court would not remit the matter for the purpose of having the matter re-opened.
The plaintiff submits that this proceeding also is vexatious as it had no prospects of success and that Mr Rahman sought to re-litigate matters that had already been decided against him. 
Mr Rahman's written submissions in the present proceedings contend Sackville AJA was not a valid judge and the Court was not properly convened, citing [s 101](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s101.html) (2) of the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) as follows - "An Appeal shall not lie to the Court of Appeal, except by leave of the Court of Appeal, from - an erroneous and transgress and violation of statutes has "given birth" of eternal sense of injustice offence, crimes against the citizens not from his social lineage." 
He refers also to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s37.html) (Acting Judges) and [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s43.html) but does not explain how they assist his argument: in fact they do not. General allegations are also made against the judges of misconduct and crimes against humanity. No evidence for such serious allegations is provided.

Rahman versus Riordan & Anor <case>
Mr Rahman sought special leave to appeal the decisions of McClellan CJ at CL and the Court of Appeal to the High Court on 9 February 2011. After setting out the scope of Mr Rahman's argument, Heydon and Bell JJ stated - "[2] Giles JA was unable to see legal merit in either contention and concluded that there were no prospects of successfully appealing from the orders below.
Nothing in the papers filed in support of the application for special leave to appeal calls that conclusion into question. If special leave were granted the appeal would have no prospects of success."
The plaintiff contends that it was a vexatious proceeding as it was doomed to failure. 
Mr Rahman submits that he went to the Registry of the High Court and that the determination and judgment of Heydon and Bell JJ was not made "observing Due process of law- 'rule of law'". Mr Rahman also speaks of - "in the regime by His Hon Franchis, CJ [sic] as appointed by Labor
Government by violations of statute rights, human rights under International law and thus trespass and later the whole Judicature of Australia has compounded that sin and crimes- / transgress unlawful decisions without statute and thus falls under 'crimes against humanity and without notifying the applicant for such unlawful process , when no defence was made by the
Defendants in the High Court." 
This, Mr Rahman asserts "has given birth to injustice and crimes against humanity and trespass of all domestic, international law, treaty and convention law as ratified by the Australian Government".
Mr Rahman also contends that the decision of the Court in refusing special leave was made (emphasis original) - "'without justiciability and without 'rule of law, procedural fairness, interpretations of statute laws, error of law -an act of institutional racism by violations of statute law as transgress, tyrannical ruler ,made self -eccentric law and Institutional racism that infringed and violated the statutory right by defying applicant's statutory submissions".

Rahman versus Riordan <case>
On 23 December 2010 Mr Rahman filed a Notice of Motion seeking to set aside the orders made in the Court of Appeal on 23 September, 1 November and 16 December 2010 and for an order fixing a date for the rehearing of his application for leave to appeal the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL of 20 April 2010. The motion was heard (Tobias, Macfarlan JJA and Sackville AJA) on 9 March 2011 and dismissed with costs. Macfarlan JA commented at ([3]) that much of what Mr Rahman had said and wrote in his submissions was difficult to understand and at times unintelligible but that, as best as his Honour could determine, Mr Rahman contended that one or more of the earlier courts were not properly constituted, that one or more of the judges had participated in earlier decisions concerning him and should have disqualified himself, that "judicial racism" infected the decisions and that, in a variety of ways the judges failed to perform their duties or committed errors. These contentions, his Honour noted, had been raised and rejected by previous decisions of the Court: they were baseless. Agreeing with Macfarlan JA, Tobias JA observed that that "there is no rational basis whatsoever for the assertion that this Court is improperly or illegally constituted" (at [10]). Sackville AJA also agreed, pointing out that [s 37](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/s37.html) of the [Supreme Court Act 1970](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/) authorised the appointment of acting judges.
The plaintiff submits that this proceeding was vexatious as it sought to re-litigate matters that had already been determined, especially so as the motion was heard after the refusal by the High Court of special leave to appeal. The plaintiff also contends that the proceedings were instituted to harass, or annoy or achieve another wrongful purpose light of the very serious allegations made against members of the judiciary.

Rahman versus Riordan <case>
Mr Rahman on 16 March 2011 filed another Notice of Motion seeking to have orders of the Court of Appeal of 23 September 2010, 1 November 2010, 16 December 2010 and 9 March 2011 set aside. The motion was dismissed with costs. Macfarlan JA (with whom Young JA and Tobias AJA agreed) said - "[2] [M]uch of what Mr Rahman has said and written in support of the present
Notice of Motion is difficult to understand. It is at times unintelligible. As best as I can determine, the effect of his contentions is however as follows.
 [3] First, Mr Rahman alleges that one or more of the Courts that made the earlier decisions or orders was not properly constituted under the provisions of the [Supreme Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/). An argument to the same effect was rejected by this Court on 9 March 2011. I can still discern no sensible argument to support that contention.
 [4] Secondly, Mr Rahman contends that various of the judges involved in the decisions to which I have referred were guilty of "judicial behaviour" that was "erroneous, trespass, transgress, judicial racism and abuse of statutes" and also lacked "intellectual honesty". Mr Rahman has not identified any arguable basis for these allegations.
 [5] Thirdly, Mr Rahman contends that the Court has been prejudiced against him because of his "social class". Again there is no basis for this allegation.
 [5] Fourthly, Mr Rahman requested that his Notice of Motion be adjourned for hearing before a different panel of judges. There is no basis for this to be done."
The plaintiff submits that this proceeding was vexatious because it had no real prospects of success and was re-litigation of matters that had already been determined on a number of occasions. The plaintiff further contended that the proceeding was conducted in such a way as to either harass or annoy, or achieve another wrongful purpose, which it submits is evident by the serious but baseless allegations made by Mr Rahman. 
In relation to these proceedings, Mr Rahman maintains the allegations which have already been quoted above, mentioning, in addition, particular members of the judiciary - "The applicant construe that the judiciary of NSW and High Court of
Australia must produce such order as made by the Governor-General of
Australia, / Parliament of Commonwealth Government -Federal / Governor or
Parliament of NSW for such order that empowered Justices J.Dyson Heydon ,
V. Margaret Bell , High Court of Australia and Justices MacFarlan, PW. Young ,
R.Giles, Acting Justices H.M.Tobias, Kenneth Handley , R.Sackville Court of
Appeal , Justice PD McClellan, Supreme Court and Registrar Bradford C for such measures against other social class whom they seek justice against the
Government Officials for the corruptions and unlawful acts under law ..." 
The legal fees proceedings
The submissions of the plaintiff usefully set out the context for the institution of this set of proceedings - "Mr Rahman retained John Marsden and others trading as Marsdens Law Group to prepare submissions for him in the hearing before the ADT in 2003.
MLG rendered a bill for the work performed. Mr Rahman disputed this bill. MLG brought proceedings in the Local Court and, on 22 October 2009, obtained a judgment in its favour for the outstanding sum plus interest.

Mr Rahman retained the services of Edward T Davis & Co Pty Ltd trading as
Davis Breen Conti Solicitors (DBC) to answer a number of questions regarding his employment or possible employment by the DET in a conference in April
DBC rendered a bill for the work performed. Mr Rahman disputed this bill. DBC offered to accept payment of their bill in the sum of $160 in order to settle any dispute. Mr Rahman rejected that offer. Ultimately, DBC obtained a judgment in their favour in the Local Court in the sum of $236.78." 
Rahman versus Marsdens Law Group <case>
On 22 November 2004 Mr Rahman commenced proceedings by way of summons to challenge various interlocutory decisions (which were out of time) and the judgment entered in the Small Claims Division of the Local Court in favour of Marsdens. Mr Rahman's contended that the judgment was unjust and unfair because it failed to account of all the areas of law raised by him. The Master held that Mr Rahman submissions on this point were without any substance and, at all events, the appeals lay only for denials of natural justice and not for errors of law (at [16]). Mr Rahman had also made strong "insulting or offensive" allegations (including racial bias) against judicial officers together with allegations of harassment and intimidation. The Master held, in effect, that nothing relied on by the plaintiff supported these assertions (at [19]) and the appeal was "devoid of merit" (at [14]). 
The plaintiff submits that this proceeding was vexatious as the plaintiff claims that the proceeding was conducted in such a way as to either harass or annoy or achieve some other wrongful purpose by, once again, making unfounded and baseless allegations of judicial bias.

Rahman versus John Robert Marsden trading as Marsdens Law Group & Ors <case>
On 18 February 2005 Mr Rahman began contempt proceedings against Mr John Marsden and the members of his firm for allegedly failing to comply with a subpoena that was issued at Mr Rahman's request on 24 January 2005. McClellan CJ at CL dismissed the notice of motion: the Rule requiring a statement of charge to be filed had not been complied with and the affidavit relied on "provides no foundation for the allegation that the order of the Court had been breached"; nor was there evidence of service of the subpoena. 
The plaintiff again contends that this proceeding was vexatious as it had no prospects of success.
Mr Rahman in the present proceedings makes a number of allegations against his Honour, including, inter alia, "abuse & transgress by McClellan... as racial discrimination - against the administrations of justices and human right". 
Rahman versus Edward T David <case>
In March 2005, Mr Rahman appealed to this Court (James J) against decisions of the Local Court in respect of DBC's costs, the first (7 October 2004) being the judgment against him for $236.78, the second (also 7 October 2004) from the refusal to set aside a writ of execution and the third (10 March 2005), a refusal to set aside the judgment of 7 October 2004. Mr Rahman contended that the assessor was not properly appointed. This was rejected (at [20)]. He complained about the solicitor's unsatisfactory conduct of a conference and the standard of legal services he had provided, as well as a mistake of fact made by the assessor. This last was irrelevant, since appeal lay only in respect of a denial of natural justice (at [22], [23]). His allegation that the assessor, being a solicitor, was biased in favour of the claimants who were solicitors, was rejected as without substance (at [24]) as was his submission (at [25]) that the refusal to permit him to cross-examine the solicitor was a denial of natural justice, this being a procedural characteristic of the jurisdiction exercised by the Small Claims Division of the Local Court. Mr Rahman alleged from the bar table the assessor had been comatose at times during the hearing and this constituted a denial of natural justice. James J found no evidence to support the allegation (at [30]). A submission that the assessor was biased was also rejected as a misconstruction of a remark made by him during the hearing (at [31]). As to each impugned decision the appeal was dismissed with costs. 
The traffic offences proceedings
The plaintiff's submissions usefully set out the background to these proceedings - "On 14 December 2009, Mr Rahman was convicted for a speeding offence by the
Bankstown Local Court. The informant in that proceeding was Paul Bimson.

On 27 June 2011, Mr Rahman was convicted for a traffic offence by the Sydney
Local Court. The informant in that proceeding was Darrin Hooper." 
Rahman versus Bimson <case>
On 11 January 2010 Mr Rahman sought a stay or dismissal of his conviction of speeding on 14 December 2009. Mr Rahman sought prerogative as well as appellate relief but as to decisions which were nowhere clearly specified. Preliminary hearings before the Registrar and McCallum J did not solve the problem. Mr Rahman simply refused to amend his summons, despite its problems being pointed out to him on a number of occasions, seeking rather to challenge the directions. Ultimately, the defendants sought summary dismissal. Following submissions from Mr Rahman seeking to have McCallum J disqualify herself (he having "no confidence in [her Honour] as a person able to determine any issue in the proceedings" (at [80])) and declining to amend his summons, her Honour dismissed it with costs. 
The plaintiff submits that this proceeding had no real prospects of success and that Mr Rahman's seeking to have McCallum J disqualify herself without any basis was conduct as to achieve a wrongful purpose.

Rahman versus Hooper (District Court , Judicial Registrar Smith, 17 January 2012)
Mr Rahman sought to challenge the conviction of 27 June 2011 in the District Court, by way of "summons commencing an appeal" in the civil jurisdiction filed on 21 November 2011. He did not institute proceedings in the criminal jurisdiction. He made a number of allegations in the summons, including that the informant Mr Hooper was under some sort of intoxication or that he was not the driver whom Mr Hooper had pulled over. The Registrar informed Mr Rahman, at the hearing on 17 January 2012, that the only civil jurisdiction that the Court had was in relation to appeals from the Small Claims Tribunal. Mr Rahman insisted that the fine of $145 fell into this category, despite being informed that it was considered to be a criminal, not civil matter. Accordingly, the summons was dismissed by the Registrar as an abuse of process. 
The plaintiff submits that the summons was doomed to failure and, in accordance with the Registrar's decisions, the proceeding was vexatious.
By way of history, I note that Mr Rahman sought to set aside the Registrar's decision by Notice of Motion in the District Court. This was summarily dismissed by Armitage DCJ on 29 March 2012. 
The UTS Proceedings
The submissions of the plaintiff usefully set out the background to this set of proceedings - "In 2009, Mr Rahman was enrolled at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).
Whilst enrolled, Mr Rahman received a letter dated 28 April 2009 advising him that he was to be temporarily excluded from using "UTS on line" for seven days while an investigation of non academic misconduct proceeded. That letter was signed by Rosalind Dubs, UTS's Registrar at the time.

In a letter dated 9 June 2009 (also signed by Ms Dubs),the UTS gave formal notification of a decision of the Deputy Vice Chancellor to impose conditions on Mr Rahman as a student.

By letter dated 10 November 2009, Mr Rahman was advised that the Deputy Vice
Chancellor of the UTS had accepted a recommendation that he be excluded from the UTS for a period of 12 months, and that he receive a reprimand. This was signed by John Hartigan, Registrar (Ms Dubs no longer holding that position).

In a letter dated 30 November 2009, Mr Rahman was advised that he had 30 days from 4 December 2009 in which to lodge an internal appeal within the UTS from the decision to exclude him from the UTS for 12 months." 
Rahman versus Dubs (Supreme Court , McCallum J, 18 December 2009, unrep)
On 2 November 2009 Rahman commenced proceedings in this Court against Ms Dubs seeking prerogative relief, essentially to restrain implementation of the decision to exclude him for a year. However, the summons did not seek review of the relevant decision. On 18 December 2009 McCallum J dismissed two notices of motion filed by Mr Rahman, one relating to directions by Registrar Bradford and the other seeking an injunction, ordered the University be substituted as a defendant and directed that the matter proceed by way of a statement of claim. Mr Rahman was also ordered not to file any further notice of motion in the proceedings without leave. He was ordered to pay costs. 
The plaintiff submits that this was a vexatious proceeding as it was manifestly misconceived and a waste of the Court's time and unnecessarily joined Ms Dubs as a party without any reasonable ground. The plaintiff contends that Mr Rahman conducted the proceedings in such a way as to harass or annoy, cause delay or detriment, or achieve another wrongful purpose. 
In his submissions in this case, Mr Rahman has continued his allegations against Ms Dubs, asserting "unlawful practices" of the review committee and that Ms Dubs acted "without any statutory right but chauvinistic prejudice for the retaliations of the applicant's challenges" and makes other allegations about "academic mafias". He also asserts that Registrar Bradford made "unlawful acts" and that there was "absolute judicial racism being a 'judicial 'mafia'". He further claims in his written submissions - "The applicant claim and construe that by doing so, the Judicature, NSW has transgress the due process of law- procedural fairness, absence of constitution entrenchment , act of arbitrariness , abuse of power that has that give birth to the crime, immoral and abuse of power for the sheer ,Institutional judicial racism -a perversion for the administration of justice 'rule of law' in Australia by the 'judicial mafias' as it operated in Nazi Germany against certain social class as well as in the 'Apartheid Regime of 'Ian Botha's 'in South Africa- as judicial racism that must be restrained.

As the matter was sent to the alleged perpetrator 'McCallum J 'whom did judicial crimes under the above mentioned enactments in other proceedings mentioned the applicant reinforced the claimed of challenge ' No Confidence' for her authority' for administration of justice in this issues as claimed to be a 'Duty Judge', when the judicature authority are engaged unfair practices in the name sham procedural fairness but she refused to relinquish her authority as she did before and pronounced that all three NOM will be listed on 18 December 2009 . The applicant submitted notice for attention to the Principal Registrar for such unlawful.
The Judicature authority remains silent about such practices of 'Duty
Judge' as by McCallum J and others when applicant submitted Motion' of No confidence' - of such planned Procedural unfairness and without International standard made verdict -dismissal of the two Notice of Motions of the 7 and 8
December 2009 and other orders by violations of statute law as transgress , tyrannical ruler ,made self -eccentric law that infringed and violated the statutory right by defying applicant's statutory submissions". <case> 
Mr Rahman sought leave to appeal from McCallum J, asserting a denial of natural justice as to which Hodgson JA (with whom Tobias JA agreed) held (at [2]) "[t]here is no evidence and no relevant submission suggesting any denial of natural justice." Mr Rahman also submitted that her Honour erred in substituting the University as the defendant and in ordering the matter proceed by way of statement of claim. No basis was demonstrated for supposing these orders were wrong and leave was refused with costs. 
The plaintiff contends that this was vexatious as it "had no real prospects of success".
Mr Rahman in his written submissions states - "The applicant took this proceedings in the Court of Appeal for justice that was violated -rule of law' and was determined by the Hodgson JA and Tobias JA on 28 May 2010 when for procedural legitimacy written and verbal 'No
Confidence of Motion' submitted for relinquishing their authority of Quorum for such judges, but they defied for such renunciation while they left the court room and came back at the end from indoor secret meeting in the court room and delivered ex-tempore decision by Tobias J by violation, transgress , of all the applicable enactments and such jusiciability .
The applicant to make an end of such arbitrariness, unfairness and unlawful acts by the Judicatures of NSW for relief- justice -submitted right".

Rahman versus Dubs (Supreme Court , Hidden J, 1 February 2011, unrep)
Despite McCallum J's order requiring leave before filing further notices of motion, Mr Rahman filed a notice of motion on 14 December 2010 without leave. The matter came before the Registrar, who referred the matter to Hidden J in the Duty List. Although Mr Rahman's submissions were obscure, it seems he wished to challenge the jurisdiction of the Registrar to refer interlocutory matters to a judge and of the duty judge to deal with them. He also challenged the competence and impartiality of the Registrar and McCallum J. Hidden J stated, "I say no more than there is clearly no substance in any of it ... [and the] motion is simply without foundation". The motion was dismissed with costs. 
The plaintiff submits that this was also a vexatious proceeding as it was initiated contrary to a Court order and that it was doomed to fail as the matter had already been determined by the Court and the Court of Appeal. 
Rahman versus Dubs <case>
On 21 February 2011 Mr Rahman filed another notice of motion without leave complaining, inter alia, of the "illegitimate order" made by Hidden J, all the "unlawful interlocutory decisions made by McCallum J" and making allegations of the same or similar character to those cited above. This was unsurprisingly dismissed by Registrar Bradford with costs. 
On 15 April 2011 Mr Rahman again filed a notice of motion without leave seeking to have the orders of McCallum J, Hidden J and Registrar Bradford set aside. This was referred to Rothman J as duty judge, who adjourned it as Mr Rahman was not ready to proceed. The matter was heard by Johnson J on 2 May 2011 and judgment was delivered the following day. His Honour noted Mr Rahman continued to agitate the matters that had previously been determined against him and relied on no new matter. The motion was without merit and was dismissed with indemnity costs. 
The plaintiff contends that the proceeding was vexatious as Mr Rahman sought to re-litigate matters that had already been determined and did so without any proper basis or justification.
Mr Rahman asserts here that this was a challenge of "such recurring unlawful practices - violations of Human Rights and denial of 'justice by those Justices reiterate to defy such acts of 'Duty Judge' Johnson J". In relation to the hearing, Mr Rahman complains that the matter was listed at 9 but was not heard until that afternoon and that his Honour did not have the authority to do so. Mr Rahman submits - "when nearly at 11.55 hours called for such proceedings and advised to come back again at 14.00 when the matter was listed at 09.00 hours and applicant refuted to come back again at 14.00 and reiterated 'this Court - Johnson J has no authority for such adjudications .
Nevertheless, the applicant came back after 14.00 hours and until 15.48 hours Johnson J called for such proceedings and the applicant challenge for such authority to be a 'Duty judge' when His Hon. failed to produce any instrument."
I note that on 30 March 2012, Mr Rahman again filed a notice of motion in the proceedings without obtaining leave. It was rejected by the Manager, Listing Services.

Rahman versus Dubs <case>
On 4 July 2011 Mr Rahman filed a notice of motion in the Court of Appeal seeking to set aside the orders of Hodgson and Tobias JJA in Rahman versus Dubs  <case> The grounds were articulated by Barrett JA (Meagher JA and Tobias AJA agreeing) as the failure of Hodgson and Tobias JJA to disqualify themselves as they had made or agreed in decisions adverse to Mr Rahman and were guilty of "'fraudulent judicial practice', 'erroneous trespass', 'abuse of statutes', 'judicial racism' and 'corrupt conduct'", the orders of McCallum J, subject to the same criticisms, were unlawful, the fact that only two judges heard the application for leave, and the decision were not based on the law. Each of these complaints was inevitably rejected, it being observed also that the allegations against the propriety of the judges were made without any basis whatever. The notice of motion was dismissed with costs. 
The plaintiff submits that this proceeding was vexatious as it was doomed to fail and Mr Rahman sought to re-litigate matters that had already been determined without "any fresh basis or reason" and parts of it were conducted in such a manner as to annoy or harass or achieve another wrongful purpose, when he made a number of egregious baseless allegations against sitting members of the judiciary and, in respect of McCallum J, without any relevance".

Rahman versus Dubs <case>
This proceeding came before Garling J on 20 July 2012 as List Judge in relation to the summons filed by Mr Rahman on 2 November 2009. Garling J brought to Mr Rahman's attention that he had still not complied with the order of McCallum J to file a statement of claim and gave him until 4pm on 26 July 2012 to do so, standing the matter over until 27 July 2012, indicating that the proceedings would be dismissed if the direction was not complied with.
Mr Rahman filed the statement of claim on 26 July 2012. Garling J noted that the order of McCallum J relating to changing the defendant to the UTS and removing Ms Dubs was not complied with. Rather, Mr Rahman added another two individuals to the proceedings - Mr Hartigan (who had replaced Ms Dubs) and Ms Shirley Alexander. Garling J held that leave was required to add any additional parties, no such leave had been granted and the additional defendants could not be joined. His Honour also noted that the statement of claim did not comply with the Supreme Court Rules and that "large slabs" of the summons had been copied into a form that appeared to have been derived from High Court forms. His Honour commented that the statement of claim paid no attention to the UCPR, rr 14.6, 14.7, 14.8 and 14.9 and did not comply with "other more obvious requirements". His Honour ultimately found - "[30] The document does not identify with clarity the causes of action upon which Mr Rahman sues and with clarity the relief which he seeks. Nor does the document identify the material facts, but not the evidence, upon which he relies to make out the causes of action which he identifies.
 [31] It is not in a satisfactory state and is not a document, which can adequately enable the defendant to understand the claims being made against it.
 [32] I have concluded that the document is embarrassing and has a tendency to cause prejudice and delay in the proceedings. It is manifestly an abuse of the
Court's process. It must be struck out."
Garling J, in considering whether the proceedings should be summarily dismissed, noted the following submission of Mr Rahman - "[After referring to the correspondence concerning his student status - ]
Throughout the proceedings the applicant submits with evidences of documents in court will testify that the defendant - University of Technology, Sydney -
UTS has not submitted any defence for the legitimacy of such acts of 'infringement of educational right' since 2009 to 2012. And thus validates the applicant's relief claims for such acts by the University of Technology - UTS [Officials] in the submitted documents of such legitimate claims and for justice for the cause of UTS decisions that are not legitimate under substantive law of NSW but are of: discretion not obedient to the rule of law since on 19 January 2009." 
Referring to other submissions, his Honour characterised the case as follows -
 "[53] In short, it seems that Mr Rahman wishes to contend that the conduct of
UTS, by its various officers, contravened a right, personal to him, of education, created by one or other or all of: 
Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human rights which provides: "Everyone has the right to education ... Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to al on the basis of merit"; 
Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which does not refer to education but rather equality before the Courts and standards which relate to the conduct of criminal proceedings; and 
Article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights which reads: "(i) The States parties to the present Covenant recognize (sic) the right of everyone to education ... [and that] ...

Higher education shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means ..." [54] The balance of the submissions seems to make assertions covering allegations involving: counsel for all of the defendants having committed some unspecified crimes; allegations that decisions of McCallum J and Registrar Bradford were an abuse of judicial discretion; allegations that justice has been perverted, obstructed, prevented and disobeyed by both counsel for the defendants and by Judges or other judicial officers of the Court; and there have been breaches, unspecified in nature, or by whom, of Article 70 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and the [International Criminal Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/icca2002303/) (Cth)."
His Honour concluded - "[55] The causes of action based upon breaches of various international covenants and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, are not justiciable in this Court. There is no domestic legislation, either of the Commonwealth
Government, or the NSW Government, which make these international laws part of the domestic law of NSW. A breach of the international covenants, and laws, is not of itself justiciable, unless and until a domestic law adopts these international covenants and makes them a law of the State: Minister for
Immigration and Ethnic Affairs versus Ah Hin Teoh <case>; [(1995) 183 CLR 273.] [56] But even if they were laws of the State, they are not able to be used in the way in which Mr Rahman seeks to use them. They are statements of ambition, broad rights within a community and perhaps, aspirational goals. They do not create a private cause of action lying in the individual against a State, or any other body, which can be sued upon.
 [57] There is no basis at all for any cause of action asserting that counsel for the defendants has committed an unspecified crime nor that there have been breaches of the [International Criminal Court
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/icca2002303/) or
Article 70 of the Rome Statue of the International Criminal Court (assuming that it applies directly in Australia). It is unnecessary to determine this question.
 [58] There is no basis for an allegation that the decisions of McCallum J and
Registrar Bradford were an abuse of judicial discretion, nor is there any basis for allegations that justice has be "perverted, obstructed, prevented and disobeyed".
 [59] All of these allegations, to my mind, are vexatious and an abuse of the process of court. There is no reason why the allegations should be allowed to stand, or to be made.
 [60] The proceedings as presently constituted insofar as they seek to challenge earlier decisions of UTS are moot. That is because, as the evidence demonstrates, and as the additional submissions of Mr Rahman appear to accept, the decisions which are preventing Mr Rahman attending as a student of UTS are not those sued upon, but rather much later decisions.
 [61] If Mr Rahman has any claim for administrative law relief, and it is far from certain that he does, then it is those decisions which, logically, must be the subject of the proceedings. But they are not.
 [62] In all of the circumstances, it is clear, beyond argument, that the causes of action relied upon are doomed to fail and it is appropriate for the
Court, having regard to the terms in which they are alleged, and the absence of any support them, to exercise its discretion and summarily dismiss the proceedings, because no reasonable cause of action is disclosed and, as a result, the proceedings are an abuse of process of the Court."
The plaintiff submits that this was a vexatious proceeding for the same reasons as Garling J stated in his judgment. 
In his written submissions here, Mr Rahman asserts of the judiciary of New South Wales, which he says also applies to the federal judiciary - "As mentioned in the above submissions the nature of whole spectrum of NSW
Judiciary and its Officials [except few] are in continuous practices of violations and transgress of the substantive enactments against the Ethnic citizens for favour to their social'GENOMES' -the Officials of the
Government Department . They are acting as lawmaker and make laws of their whim of minds whatever He /SHE [McCallum J, P.Garling, Johson , Facferling and others and Registrar Bradford C. Deputy Registrar James Howard ] thinks for the validly for the Officials who are the perpetrators violated and acted
Crimes against Humanity -are same by the Federal Court -Judicature and its
Officials-Judges and Registrars." 
The proceedings in the Federal Courts and Tribunals 
Austudy Proceedings
The plaintiff's submissions usefully set out the background to this set of proceedings - "On 8 November 2007, Mr Rahman received an offer for admission to study at the
Australian National University (ANU) to undertake the program "Graduate
Certificate of Australian Migration Law and Practice".

On 7 February 2008, Mr Rahman applied for Austudy.

By way of letter dated 27 March 2008, Mr Rahman's application for Austudy was refused by Centrelink, the department having the administration of Austudy.
The application was refused on the ground that Mr Rahman's net assets exceeded the upper limit for the value of assets allowable under the [Social Security
Act 1991](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ssa1991186/).

Mr Rahman complained to Centrelink, which responded in an undated letter with details of the reasons for its decision. That letter set out "as advised in our letter of 27 March 2008, you can ask for an Authorised Review Officer to look at this decision if you disagree with it ... The ARO can change the decision if it is wrong or, if they agree with the decision they can tell you how to appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT)"." [Emphasis original] 
Rahman versus Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations <case>
On 7 July 2008 Mr Rahman applied for an order of review of the decision of Centrelink not to grant him Austudy, invoking the jurisdiction of the Federal Court under [s 5](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/adra1977396/s5.html) of the [Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/adra1977396/) (Cth) and alternative relief under [s 39B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s39b.html) of the [Judiciary Act 1903](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth). 
In his written submissions, Mr Rahman alleged that, there had been an "unlawful act, transgress and abuse of power" and the decision of 27 March 2008 was "'based on forgery and false instruments' relating to the applicant's financial assets" and "'involves an error of law and must be void as the determination was affected by into [sic] corroboration of false instruments' relating to the financial assets of" Mr Rahman. He also submitted that the decision of Centrelink constitutes an attempt to disadvantage the applicant's Austudy claim 'by making a statement known to be false or misleading in a material particular or made with reckless disregard as to whether it is'."
Cowdroy J noted that, under the relevant legislation, Mr Rahman was able to seek review of the decision by an appropriate officer but provided no satisfactory reason for not having done so. His Honour considered that it was appropriate to refuse relief where there was a review procedure available which the applicant sought to bypass. The application was dismissed with costs. 
It was submitted by the plaintiff that this was a vexatious matter as it was instituted without reasonable grounds. 
It appears that Mr Rahman sought to file on 14 December 2008 in the Federal Court Registry a notice of appeal against this decision but it was rejected as out of time. In response to this, Mr Rahman on 17 December 2008 filed a notice of motion that was rejected by the Registrar on 18 December 2008 on the ground that the documents "on their face appear to be an abuse of process of the Court or frivolous or vexatious". Mr Rahman sought a review of this, which was dismissed on 9 February 2009 by Tamberlin J. 
Rahman versus Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations <case>
On 16 February 2009 Mr Rahman filed an application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal in respect of the decision of Cowdroy J (Rahman versus Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations  <case> Foster J noted (at [8]) that - "The affidavit sworn by the applicant on 16 February 2009 in support of the present application is expressed in language which is difficult to follow, confusing and somewhat rambling. In some respects, the affidavit contains scandalous material." 
The affidavit did not contain an explanation for the failure to file a notice of appeal within the required time.
Mr Rahman alleged that Cowdroy J was biased against him because he was not of the same social class or race as his Honour. He alleged that the decision was a "sham and derision" and his Honour was "improperly influenced by some extraneous (but unidentified) factor or circumstance when making the decision". In oral argument Mr Rahman stated that he wished to add that Cowdroy J was biased because he was representing himself and was not a qualified lawyer; and his Honour favoured the solicitor who represented the respondent because his Honour knew that solicitor; and his Honour did not give any or any proper consideration to the applicant's arguments. Foster J stated - "[47] On the material before me, there is no prospect that any of these allegations would be made out at the hearing of any appeal." 
His Honour concluded, after considering the arguments of Mr Rahman as to the errors he contended had been made, that the foreshadowed appeal was hopeless.
The application was therefore dismissed with costs.
It is submitted by the plaintiff that these proceedings were vexatious in that the notice of appeal had no prospects of success, and Mr Rahman sought to re-litigate issues that had already been determined by the Court. The plaintiff also claimed that the proceedings were conducted in such a way as to annoy, harass, cause delay or detriment, or achieve another wrongful purpose because the notice of motion contained allegations against a sitting judge that the Court found to be "unsubstantiated, unsupported and scandalous", which the plaintiff claims was pursued without reasonable grounds.

Social Security Proceedings
Mr Rahman was paid a Parenting Payment Single (PPS) until, on 16 December 2004, Centrelink cancelled his payments on the ground that his assets exceeded the applicable value. That decision was set aside by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on 16 January 2006. On 10 February 2006 the payments were again cancelled on the ground that assets were worth more than the permitted limit. In substance, this occurred because the value of his property had increased. Mr Rahman applied for a review by the Tribunal, which was partly successful but upheld the finding that his assets exceeded the limit.

Rahman versus Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations <case>
Mr Rahman appealed the Tribunal's decision to the AAT. In his appeal, Mr Rahman alleged, inter alia that "there was a conspiracy within Centrelink to cancel his PPS" and with the Australian Valuation Office to overvalue the property. As the Senior Member observed (at [14]), "there was no evidence whatever to substantiate this contention".
Mr Rahman took issue with the fresh review of his entitlement to the PPS, although he had himself initiated the review by producing a new valuation to Centrelink. The Commonwealth Bank provided Centrelink with statements indicating that Mr Rahman had a Mortgage Interest Saver Account with the Commonwealth Bank, which had not been disclosed to Centrelink and included in previous assessments. 
On 13 November 2006 the AAT affirmed Centrelink's decision of 10 February 2006, finding that Mr Rahman had assets that were above the maximum value to entitle him to receive the PPS.
The plaintiff submits that this proceeding was vexatious on the grounds that it had no real prospects of success as well as being conducted in such a way as to harass or annoy or achieve another wrongful purpose.

Rahman versus Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations <case> 
Mr Rahman sought to challenge the 13 November 2006 decision by appealing to the Federal Court, seeking remittal to the AAT for reconsideration. The respondent sought to strike out the notice of appeal as incompetent since it did not set out any questions of law required to be determined as required by [s 44](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aata1975323/s44.html) of the [Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/aata1975323/) (Cth), nor was a jurisdictional basis pleaded as a basis for the relief sought. Moore J summarised the notice of appeal as follows - "The notice of appeal [7] Mr Rahman is unrepresented. The notice of appeal is 21 pages in length. It identified three decisions as being those from which appeal was sought, being decisions of Centrelink, the SSAT and the AAT. However, the notice of appeal was made under O 53 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules, which provides for appeals from the AAT. Much of the notice of appeal is difficult to follow. Under the heading 'The Questions of Law', it lists a number of statutes. The next section, headed 'Concern', makes various allegations about the AAT, SSAT and
Centrelink, including allegations of corruption and claims that the Tribunal members lacked "functional legal expertise" and were 'not legally qualified with legal experience'. The nine pages which follow contain mostly extracts of legislation.
 [8] The next section is headed 'Order sought'. Five orders are identified. The first is an order pursuant to [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fcoaa1976249/s22.html) of the [Federal Court of Australia Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fcoaa1976249/) (Cth) setting aside the decision of the AAT of 13 November 2006. The second order sought is for an order pursuant to <case> of the Federal Court Act to issue writs or interlocutory orders under ss 203 and 204 of the [[Social Security
Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ssa1999338/) (Cth)].
The third order sought is the costs of the proceedings. The fourth order sought is 'cost for psychological stress and mental tortures since 2004'. The fifth order is for any other costs the Court thinks 'most appropriate in these long standing proceedings'.
 [9] The section which follows is headed 'Grounds' and is eight pages in length. This section is difficult to follow. In part it summarises the applicant's dealings with Centrelink since it first cancelled his parenting payment in December 2004. There is a claim that in cancelling his payment a second time, Centrelink "failed to follow and abused" a number of sections of the SS Act and SSA Act. It also claims that the SSAT and AAT ignored the evidence which the applicant provided regarding the valuation of the property, other assets and liabilities. There is a list of 28 questions and statements, interspersed with extracts of legislation. The questions relate to the decisions of Centrelink, the SSAT and the AAT. By way of example, one such question is: 
On what basis of [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), did the
Tribunal Members AAAT&SSAT determined and validate the value of the appellant's property is $350,000 and $340,000 and uphold for decisions $340,000, when on 16 January 2006, AAT's judgment confirmed the value is $330,000 on 2004 and $300,000 for November 2005, with an effect decline of property values with increase of interest rate twice by the federal Reserve
Bank of Australia (Documents in the File)? [10] Under the same section, the application goes on to make a number of other claims and pose other questions, which appear to relate to Centrelink's reliance on a valuation provided by the AVO.
 [11] Mr Rahman has also filed a number of other documents. One is a notice of motion filed 6 December 2006 seeking 'convictions' under the SSA Act, which reflects the second order sought in the notice of appeal. The applicant has also filed a document entitled 'notice of amendments', the intended effect of which appears to be to name additional respondents to the motion, the additional respondents being identified as 'Chief Executive Officer,
Centrelink, Agency of the Department of Human Services, Department of
Employment and Workplace Relations and other Commonwealth Departments'. Six individuals who in the notice of motion appeared under the heading 'name each party affected by orders sought' would, by virtue of the notice of amendments, appear as parties against whom Mr Rahman moves the Court. Those individuals appear to be four officers of Centrelink, and two officers of the AVO." 
His Honour noted that Mr Rahman - "... makes various allegations about the AAT, SSAT and Centrelink, including allegations of corruption and claims that the Tribunal members lacked "functional legal expertise" and were "not legally qualified with legal experience."
The matter was heard before Moore J on 24 May 2007, with judgment dismissing Mr Rahman's application and notice of motion with costs on 5 July 2007. His Honour, in substance, concluded that the notice of appeal did not comply with the Rules requiring a clear statement of the question or questions of law raised on the appeal and the grounds relied on and there was no jurisdictional basis demonstrated for the grant of the relief of law sought. 
The plaintiff contends that this was also a vexatious proceeding for a number of reasons, primarily the lack of any prospects of success. Further, the plaintiff submits the adding of the four Centrelink officers and the two officers of the AVO constituted conduct of the proceedings in such a way as to harass or annoy, cause delay or detriment, or achieve another wrongful purpose.

Rahman versus Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations <case>
Mr Rahman appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court (though this was done somewhat informally without filing a notice of appeal, or an application for leave to appeal). The Full Court (Emmett, Stone and Jacobson JJ) heard the matter on 5 November 2007, treating it as an application for leave to appeal.
The Court understood, on the basis of what Mr Rahman had said in oral submissions that his grounds of appeal, were - "(1) The primary judge was absolutely wrong and did not specify under what provisions he made orders.

The primary judge misconstrued the law and the process.

The primary judge did not specify the basis upon which the proceedings should be dismissed against some parties.

The primary judge failed to deal with the parties who were absent for contempt.

The primary judge misconstrued <case> of the SSA Act.

The Secretary did not make an order and his Honour did not say who made the order.

His Honour failed to afford Mr Rahman justice and, therefore, Mr Rahman should not be required to pay the costs."
Mr Rahman's written submissions were described (by Emmett J, Stone and Jacobson JJ agreeing) as follows - "[21] They do not address grounds of appeal. I find them quite incomprehensible. They do not address the grounds to which Mr Rahman alluded in the course of oral argument ... Mr Rahman was unable to formulate or identify the question of law that he says he wishes to raise. The reference to s 192 of the SSA Act is meaningless because that is not a provision to which the primary judge referred in the course of his reasons.
 [22] I can find nothing in the written submissions of Mr Rahman that indicates a question of law that would give jurisdiction to, or found jurisdiction for the Court in this proceeding. I do not consider that there was any error on the part of the primary judge. I certainly do not consider that the judgment and orders of the primary judge are attended with any doubt. Nevertheless, if leave is required, I would be disposed to give leave, only because of the finality of the proceeding. However, I would dismiss the appeal.
 [23] As I have said, it may well be that leave is not required. If leave is not required, I would dismiss the appeal. No notice of appeal has been filed but I would treat the submissions filed by Mr Rahman as a notice of appeal."
The Court accordingly ordered that, to the extent that it was required, leave to appeal was granted, but the appeal was dismissed with costs.
The plaintiff submits that this proceeding was also a vexatious proceeding as Mr Rahman sought to re-litigate matters that had already been decided and had no prospects of success.

Rahman versus Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations  <case>
Mr Rahman then applied for special leave to appeal in the High Court, which was heard on 16 July 2008. The Court (Gleeson CJ and Heydon J) found there were no prospects of success (at [3]) and that "[n]othing in the application for special leave to appeal to this Court reveals any reason to doubt the correctness of" the decision of the Full Federal Court (at [2]).
The plaintiff argues that it was vexatious as it had no prospects of success.

Privacy Proceedings
The submissions of the plaintiff usefully set out the background to this set of proceedings (emphasis original) - "By letter dated 23 August 2006, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) disclosed details of Mr Rahman's bank account to Centrelink. The information was disclosed pursuant to a notice given to the CBA under <case> of the SSA
Act, which relevantly provides: "The Secretary may require a person to give information, or produce a document that is in the person's custody or under the person's control, to the
Department if the Secretary considers that the information or document may be relevant to one or more of the following: the question whether a person who has made a claim for a social security payment is or was qualified for the payment.
 ..." 
On 21 December 2006, Mr Rahman complained to the Privacy Commissioner that the
CBA had breached National Privacy Principles (NPPs) of the [Privacy Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/pa1988108/) (Cth) by disclosing personal information to Centrelink.

In a letter dated 8 January 2007, an officer employed in the Office of the
Privacy Commissioner (the Officer) informed Mr Rahman that it appeared his complaint did not constitute a breach of the NPP and that she was, therefore, declining to investigate the complaint (the first decision).

On 15 January 2007, Mr Rahman protested against the first decision in a facsimile to the Privacy Commissioner.

In a letter dated 1 February 2007, the Officer reversed her decision stating she would make preliminary inquiries into Mr Rahman's allegations.

On 28 February 2007, the officer wrote to Mr Rahman stating that there had been no interference with his privacy as the information had been required by law (the second decision)." 
Rahman versus Ashpole <case>
On 5 February 2007 Mr Rahman made an application under the Federal Court Rules for an order of review of the first decision. The first respondent (Ms Ashpole) and the second respondent (Mr Barker) were officers of CBA and the third respondent was the Privacy Commissioner. The first two respondents filed a notice of motion, supported by the third respondent, seeking summary judgment under [s 31A](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fcoaa1976249/s31a.html) of the [Federal Court of Australia Act 1976](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/fcoaa1976249/) (Cth). On 20 June 2007, summary judgment in favour of the respondents was given. 
Buchanan J noted that the first decision was revoked and, Mr Rahman refusing to amend his application to seek relief in respect of the second decision, said (at [14]) "...the conclusion seems to be inevitable that the proceedings against the Privacy Commissioner have no prospect of success". His Honour, however, dealt also with the validity of the second decision, concluding that there was no reasonable prospect of success against any of the respondents, adding - "[25] In my view Mr Rahman's contentions and his application, wherever they are, or might be, directed are misconceived and without any foundation. It is inevitable that the application be dismissed for that reason and I will so order." 
Dealing with the application for indemnity costs, Buchanan J said - "[31] ... I can see no basis for the application whether in an unamended or an amended form. Mr Rahman's insistence on pursuing it in an unamended form rendered it, if this was possible, even more hopeless than otherwise. I think that the first and second respondents are entitled to be protected so far as possible, if they seek it, against the unnecessary expenditure of costs which
Mr Rahman's application has caused."
The plaintiff submits that this proceeding was vexatious as it had no prospects of success.

Rahman versus Ashpole  <case>
On 27 June 2007, Mr Rahman filed a notice of motion seeking leave to appeal from the decision of Buchanan J. Mr Rahman sought to appeal his Honour's findings as well as the decision to make the indemnity costs order. Graham J concluded - "[33] It is demonstrably clear that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting his case for review ... Nothing has been said in the applicant's submissions suggesting that the decision of the primary judge was attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration in the circumstances." 
As to the costs order, his Honour held (at [37]) that "it was plainly open to the primary judge to treat the applicant's case as a hopeless one" and refused leave to appeal, awarding indemnity costs in respect of the application.
The plaintiff again submits that this was a vexatious proceeding for the as it had no prospects of success. 
Australian Public Service Employment Proceedings
The written submissions of the plaintiff again usefully set out the background to these proceedings - "Mr Rahman applied for employment with the Department of Immigration and
Multicultural Affairs (DIMA). In accordance with the process of considering that application, Mr Rahman appeared before a selection panel.

On 27 July 2006, DIMA informed Mr Rahman that his application was unsuccessful after the selection panel had recommended that he not be employed and forwarded Mr Rahman's individual assessment to him.

On 14 August 2006, Mr Rahman sent a facsimile in response to DIMA, which DIMA responded to on 16 August 2006." 
Rahman versus Dayeh <case>
The matter came up for directions before Smith FM on 10 November 2006. The directions, inter alia, sought to deal with the issue that was raised by Mr Rahman regarding subpoenas. Mr Rahman submitted to the Court that he wished to issue subpoenas "going to 'the whole process' of his job interview and the selection process". The Court declined to grant discovery, which the Court determined was the effect of Mr Rahman's subpoenas. Included with other directions that are not relevant here, was the direction that Mr Rahman was not to issue subpoenas without prior leave of the Court.
On 21 December 2006 Mr Rahman who, by this time had not sought leave to issue any subpoena, filed a notice of motion seeking disqualification of Smith FM for bias and, maintaining that he was entitled to the subpoenas and or discovery which he had previously sought. His Honour said - "[20] Mr Rahman appeared when the matter was called today, and maintained his application that I should disqualify myself. I invited Mr Rahman to elaborate his arguments for my disqualification, but he declined to make any submissions to me. I indicated that I would not disqualify myself. At that point Mr Rahman expressed his continuing lack of confidence in me, and left the courtroom without waiting to hear my reasons for declining to disqualify myself.
 [21] The ground stated in the notice of motion is that he has "no confidence" in my continuing to constitute the Court in the matter. This unparticularised state of mind in a litigant cannot, of itself, provide a reason why I should disqualify myself, but I have considered whether his lack of confidence might be based on any matter which would provide grounds for disqualification under doctrines of apprehended bias ...
 [22] Mr Rahman's notice of motion did not give clear particulars of any action or conduct which he relied upon as raising such a reasonable apprehension, other than his disagreement with paragraphs 7 and 8 in my previous directions.
However, I have read the transcript from the last occasion, and do not think that anything was said by me which might cause the relevant apprehension. Nor do I consider that my inclusion of paragraphs 7 and 8 in the orders of the
Court might give rise to such apprehension...
 [23] Mr Rahman was afforded a full opportunity to show me today how the
Court's processes could appropriately be ordered in the interest of the administration of justice in his application, and in accordance with principles set out in the authorities which I have referred to above. He declined to take up that opportunity at today's hearing."
The application remained in the list for final hearing. 
It is argued by the plaintiff in the present proceedings that the notice of motion was a vexatious proceeding had no prospects of success and simply sought to defeat interlocutory orders that were, clearly, properly made.

Rahman versus Dayeh and Ors (No 2) <case> 
This proceeding was the substantive proceeding of the matter immediately above for which directions were ordered. Smith FM noted (at [5]) that the application "does not give particulars of any ground of legal error in relation to their activities" and added - "The stated grounds of the application otherwise contain general allegations of abuse of power, breach of rules of natural justice, failure to follow procedures and other general allegations framed in terms of s.5(1) and (2) of the AD(JR) Act without any particulars. The documents attached to the applicant's affidavit do not in my opinion provide any substance to these general allegations."
His Honour concluded - "[7] ... I am not satisfied that there was any legal defect in relation to the appointment of the selection panel, or in the procedures followed by the panel. I therefore consider that the application has no merit and should be dismissed."
The plaintiff claims that this proceeding was vexatious as it never had any prospects of success and, also, sought to re-litigate matters that had already been determined. 
Rahman versus Dayeh <case> 
On 24 May 2007, Mr Rahman made an application for leave to appeal, with an application for extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal from the interlocutory decision as to disqualification as well as the substantive decision. The matter proceeded by way of written submissions. 
Madgwick J noted (at [5]) that Mr Rahman's "submissions and draft notice of appeal are not easily comprehensible as to any ground of appeal or even clear reasons as to why the applications currently before the Court should be granted". His Honour added, Mr Rahman "also fails to explain clearly his delay in bringing each of the appeals. He seems to suggest that it was due to the failure of Smith FM to draw the time limit for appeal to his attention". Magwick J observed that Mr Rahman in the interlocutory hearing did not provide reasons as to why Smith FM should disqualify himself, and had not provided any reasons on the leave application as to why his Honour should have disqualified himself, or why his Honour was in error in refusing that application.
The Court concluded - "[9] The applicant has also failed to demonstrate any arguable appealable error of law made by his Honour in the final judgment in the matter. The draft notice of appeal and additional submissions filed in support of this application are lengthy but do not disclose any ground of appeal such that the granting of an extension of time would be justified. I agree with the submission of the respondents that any appeal would be futile in this matter.
The application for extension of time in this matter is also refused."
Mr Rahman was ordered to pay costs assessed at $1800.
The plaintiff submits that the notice of appeal and the application for an extension for time was a vexatious proceeding on the grounds that neither had any prospects of success and aspects of the appeal were pursued without reasonable cause as Mr Rahman made no submissions either initially or during the appeal as to why Smith J should disqualify himself.

Rahman versus Dayeh & Ord <case>
Mr Rahman applied in the High Court for special leave to appeal. On 27 March 2008 leave was refused (Kirby and Heydon JJ). After setting out the history of the proceedings, their Honours said - "[7] The applications to this Court are embarrassing in a technical sense. For the most part they are not intelligible, other than so far as they contend that the court below pre-judged the applications. There is no evidence to support a conclusion that the Federal Magistrate exhibited actual or ostensible bias against the applicant. Nor is reason shown to doubt the correctness of Madgwick J's refusal to grant an extension of time within which the applicant could apply for leave to appeal from the orders of the Federal
Magistrates Court. The first application relates to nothing more than a simple interlocutory question. No issue of principle requiring the intervention of this Court is demonstrated. Similarly, the second application is devoid of demonstrated legal merit. There are no reasonable prospects of success in either matter, were special leave granted.
 [8] ... He has not made out a case to warrant the grant of special leave.
Specifically, his argument that costs were ordered below as a punitive measure, is not correct, given the law and normal practice on costs in this country. The applications fail."
It is argued by the plaintiff that this was a vexatious proceeding on the basis that it had no reasonable prospects of success.

Costs Assessment Proceedings
The submissions of the plaintiff usefully set out the background to this set of proceedings - "On 1 February 2011, Hidden J made a costs order in favour of Ms Dubs against
Mr Rahman in respect of a Notice of Motion he filed in the UTS proceedings ...
Ms Dubs applied for an assessment of her entitlement to costs pursuant to that order. An assessment was undertaken by Mr John Sharpe, a costs assessor duly appointed under the [Legal Profession Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/lpa2004179/). Mr
Sharpe determined that Mr Rahman was to pay $8,067.25 plus the costs of the assessment (the First Sharpe Assessment).

On 4 April 2011, Registrar Bradford made a costs order against Mr Rahman in respect of a Notice of Motion he filed in the UTS proceedings ... Ms Dubs applied for an assessment of her entitlement to costs pursuant to that order.
An assessment was undertaken by Mr Sharpe. Mr Sharpe determined that Mr Rahman was to pay $12,159.13 as well as $891.59 for the costs of the assessment (the Second Sharpe Assessment).

Costs assessments were also made by Michael Eagle in respect of costs orders obtained in favour of Ms Dubs on 27 May 2011 and 23 September 2011." [Emphasis original].

Rahman versus Sharpe (District Court , Delaney DCJ, 13 February 2012, unrep)
On 25 July 2011, Mr Rahman commenced proceedings by summons in the District Court appealing the First Sharpe Assessment. He named as defendants, Mr Sharpe, Mr James Howard, the Manager Costs Assessment, Mr Paul Baram, a partner of the firm who acted for Ms Dubs, Mr John Hartigan, the Registrar of UTS, Ms Shirley Alexander, the Deputy Vice Chancellor and Ms Dubs. The defendants filed a Notice of Motion seeking various orders, including summary dismissal. Mr Rahman appeared when the motion was first mentioned and adjourned to 2pm that day. He did not appear at 2pm when it was called for hearing and the matter was heard in his absence. On 13 February Delaney DCJ struck out the summons, giving leave for Mr Rahman to replead within 21 days. 
Whilst neither transcript nor reasons have been located and, consequently, have not been produced, an assessment of the prospects of Mr Rahman's case can be made on the basis of the summons and affidavit which he filed. The thrust of the summons may be sufficiently gathered from the following extract from the first (of four) paragraphs under the heading "Appeal Grounds" - "1. This appeals mechanism serves to ensure fairness and consistency in any decisions of a Court of a fair Parliamentary Democratic Government and its principles is to 'establish Dicey's rule of law' and 'precept of concurrence jurisprudence of the world' and so serves to uphold public confidence in the justice system where the justices may not are of value neutral as is evident from the alleged decisions of: Registrar Bradford C & Justices McCallum J, Supreme Court and Hodgson J and Acting Justice
Tobias which are of: wrong, without statute, without 'rule of law', and without any authority and in its interpretations and applications of enactments and provisions in both of the domestic law and emerging new international law in global context. - 'a view that judges do not make law' as was expressed by Gibbs J but they violated the provisions UCPR and [Supreme
Court Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/sca1970183/)'." 
The ensuing paragraphs make allegations against the integrity and competence of various judicial officers, without any arguable basis. Nowhere does Mr
Rahman articulate any ground for disputing the assessment.
A further summons was filed on 1 March 2012. It was no improvement over that which had been struck out. On 26 July 2012, it was struck out for want of due despatch. An application for summary dismissal would have been irresistible. 
The plaintiff submits that Mr Rahman's proceedings were doomed to fail. It was also offensive. Accordingly, they were vexatious proceedings.

Rahman versus Sharpe (No 1) [[2012] NSWDC 48] 
Mr Rahman appealed to the District Court from the second Sharpe assessment by way of summons filed on 2 March 2012 (the second Sharpe assessment), naming the same six defendants as in his appeal against the first Sharpe assessment. 
Mr Rahman sought an order that there were unlawful determinations of costs and orders against Ms Dubs for alleged perjury and against Messer's Sharpe, Howard and Baram pursuant to the ICAC Act for "corrupt conduct" as well as relief "for the 'heinous' crime of submitting false cost assessments". Notices of motion seeking to have all defendants except Ms Dubs removed and for summary dismissal were heard by Johnstone DCJ on 5 April 2012. His Honour first removed the first and second defendants and was going on the hear the other applications when Mr Rahman left the courtroom, despite his Honour's warning that the hearing would nevertheless proceed in his absence. 
As was inevitable, the remaining defendants except for Ms Dubs were also removed. There was never a proper basis for joining them. The judge described the summons as - "[12] ... a rambling hotchpotch of complaints about a wide range of matters, none of which appear to relate to the assessment, itself. The numbering is confused and it is impossible to filter out of the mass of material in the
Summons just what the precise grounds of appeal might be." 
Dealing with the so-called grounds of appeal, his Honour said - "[25] None of these three grounds of appeal, so far as I can discern, raises a decision as to a matter of law arising in the assessment proceedings.
 [26] But the saga does not end there." 
His Honour then summarised 18 further complaints in the Summons, saying of them - "[45] ... It is apparent from this summary of the matters set out in the
Summons that the document is embarrassing and vexatious, and a clear abuse of process.
 [46] There is no doubt in my mind that the Summons should be struck out on this basis alone.
 [47] None of the matters to which I have referred identifies any decision, let alone any error, on the part of the costs assessor on a question relating to a matter of law that could ground an appeal under <case> of the LPA 2004 and as presently "pleaded" the appeal is utterly unarguable and has no prospects of success at all.'
His Honour found - "[53] ... [Really] all Mr Rahman wants to do is to re-litigate all the grievances he thinks or believes or perceives have been visited upon him by the University of Technology, by the Supreme Court, and by the costs assessment process. No doubt, in due course, the District Court will be included amongst those persons." and concluded - "[59] In my view the appeal never had any prospects of success and was totally hopeless from the outset. To the extent that the plaintiff sought to rely upon s 384 of the LPA 2004 in relation to an appeal as of right, such an appeal never had any prospects of success. No application was made for leave to appeal under <case>." 
The summons was dismissed with indemnity costs.
The Plainitff submits that the whole of the proceedings, including the unnecessary joinder of the additional five defendants, was a vexatious proceeding as there were no prospects of success. Mr Rahman's allegations of serious offences against the parties showed that the proceedings were designed to harass or annoy them. 
Rahman versus Eagle (District Court , Neilsen DCJ, 2 December 2011, unrep)
On 2 December 2011, when he failed to appear, a Notice of Motion naming Mr Eagle and five other defendants Mr Rahman seeking orders related to a costs assessment made in Mr Eagle's favour was dismissed by Neilson DCJ. His Honour removed the third, fourth and fifth defendants as parties and, stating that the appeal "is both frivolous and vexatious", dismissed it and ordered indemnity costs. Mr Rahman then filed notices of motion seeking to relitigate the matter, as well as the summary dismissal. These were similar in most respects to the claims made in relation to Ms Dubs assessment. 
The Bankruptcy Proceedings
After obtaining a judgment following the costs assessment, Ms Dubs issued a Bankruptcy Notice and, consequential upon non-compliance, sought a sequestration order. In relation to the Bankruptcy proceedings, Mr Rahman, I think, submits in this proceeding that the Federal Court and the Federal Magistrate's Court do not have the jurisdiction to deal with these matters as they are "violations for the whole class of people who are always vulnerable". Mr Rahman also says - "Noble Solicitors/ Counsels of Australia [social lineage of colonial backgrounds] have lost their morals and ethics in such areas of law . They never have brought such challenge what the Federal Court of Australia and
Federal Magistrates Court of Australia ,- and its employee -Judges /
Magistrates are engaged not moral acts but corrupt practices and such challenges under sovereignty of the Constitutions." 
Dubs versus Rahman <case>
The application came before Raphael FM in the Bankruptcy Duty List on 25 June 2012. Mr Rahman objected to the application for a sequestration order and filed a notice purporting to state grounds of opposition and an affidavit in support. His Honour said, "Both documents are embarrassing as that term is known to the law" and ordered Mr Rahman to file and serve his grounds again. He did so but, as his Honour said, "with no greater clarity".
Mr Rahman objected to Raphael FM hearing the matter, as he was not happy with the orders previously made by his Honour. Raphael FM rejected the suggestion and also rejected his application to have the proceedings transferred to the Federal or High Court for determination on the basis that the Federal Magistrates Court did not have jurisdiction. 
In relation to the new document filed and served by Mr Rahman, the Court noted that "the document is not easy to comprehend". The points distilled in oral argument were that the Court had no jurisdiction in the matter, that Constitutional issues were raised that required referral to the Federal Court or the High Court, that the debt was created in a state court and thus outside Federal jurisdiction, that the solicitors had changed their name, that the Bankruptcy Notice had not been properly served, and he wished to seek leave to appeal the judgment upon which the debt was based, this application being due to be heard on the following day. Raphael FM was, however, satisfied that there was no merit in the notice of objection and dismissed it. His Honour made the sequestration order but stayed it for 21 days to give Mr Rahman an opportunity to argue that the judgment should be set aside. 
It was submitted by the plaintiff that the proceeding, despite not being instituted by Mr Rahman, was conducted in a vexatious manner so as to harass or annoy, given his application that Raphael FM should disqualify himself. 
Rahman versus Dubs <case>
On 2 August 2012, the date upon which the stay expired, Mr Rahman filed an application in the Federal Court applying for a stay of the orders made by Raphael FM "up to and including the hearing of an appeal". Jacobson J said - "[7] Mr Rahman addressed me at great length during which he made a number of very strong, if not scandalous, allegations against the judgment creditor and the solicitors who represent the judgment creditor. He did not put anything to me today to suggest other than that the issues which he wishes to agitate on the appeal are identical to those on which he lost comprehensively before the
Federal Magistrate. Notwithstanding the fact that the appeal in the Supreme
Court appears to be ongoing, nothing has been put before me today to show why
I ought to grant a further stay of proceedings under the sequestration order.
 [8] ... It does not seem to me that anything which was put to me today shows any prospects of success on that appeal, or at least sufficient prospect to warrant the grant of a stay. I do not need to say anything about the notice of appeal, but the observations made by the Federal Magistrate as to the difficulties in understanding the documents and the submissions put by Mr
Rahman apply equally to today's application."
The application was dismissed.
The plaintiff submits that this application was vexatious on the basis that Mr Rahman clearly only sought to re-litigate points that had already been determined against him by Raphael FM. Further, Mr Rahman had made serious allegations against Ms Dubs and her solicitors without evidence to support them. 
Rahman versus Dubs (No 2) <case> 
On 5 October 2012 the appeal from Raphael FM's decision on 19 July 2012 was decided by the Federal Court (Flick J). Mr Rahman had appeared unrepresented on 12 September 2012 and sought an adjournment on two grounds - being that a challenge to one or more of the underlying proceedings were still on foot and that he wished to be represented telling the Court that counsel had agreed to represent him, but was "unwilling to name the counsel". Flick J said, "with some considerable hesitation, the hearing was adjourned", so that Mr Rahman could be represented. When the matter next came before the Court on 26 September 2012, Mr Rahman was still unrepresented, but told the Court "that he was ready to proceed". 
In relation to the oral and written submissions made by Mr Rahman, Flick J said - "On many occasions during his oral submissions Mr Rahman repeated himself and the content of his written submissions. On a number of occasions he was invited to confine himself to making only new or different submissions. Even though considerable latitude should (perhaps) be extended to an unrepresented party to develop his submissions in the manner that he sees fit, Mr Rahman trespassed well beyond the boundaries of what was appropriate."
His Honour went on (emphasis original) - "[8] The Notice of Appeal filed in this Court on 2 August 2012 fails to comply with the Federal Court Rules 2011 (Cth). The purported "Grounds of
Appeal" are, to say the least, difficult to comprehend. To the extent that meaning can be given to them, it would appear that Mr Rahman seeks to contend (inter alia) that: - Ms Dubs is "not the official of the UTS" and that there has been some form of "fraud" committed by the solicitors for the Respondent; - there are outstanding challenges pending in the Supreme Court of New South
Wales to the costs orders that resulted in the Bankruptcy Notice; - there has been non-compliance by the Federal Magistrate with the requirements of [s
B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/s78b.html) of the [Judiciary Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ja1903112/) (Cth); - there are matters "arising under sovereignty of the Constitutional questions", including whether the [Constitution](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/coaca430/) "give[s] power for the ITSA, Official Receiver and Federal Magistrate Court for such arbitration"; and - a denial of procedural fairness.

The purported "Grounds of Appeal" extend to some three pages and the above is by no means an exhaustive account of what is there set forth. The "Orders
Sought" are also difficult to comprehend. But it is understood that Mr Rahman seeks: - an order setting aside the judgment of the Federal Magistrate, including the sequestration order; - an order that he be awarded costs "for fixed amount ... 'as your Honour pleases' ..." under the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) ; and - the conviction of the Respondent and her solicitor pursuant to (inter alia) the [Crimes Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/) (Cth).

It certainly does not advance whatever case Mr Rahman may have to repeat his assertions in the Notice of Appeal that Ms Dubs is a "fugitive party in these proceedings whom made false Affidavit ..." or his assertion that there has been "fraud identity and acts of crime". It should be noted, however, that such assertions find absolutely no support in any of the evidence and are entirely without merit.
 [9] The confusing manner in which the "Grounds of Appeal" and the "Orders
Sought" are expressed is such that the preferable course is to consider the
Federal Magistrate's reasons for decision afresh. If some appellable error is discernible, the fact that an unrepresented party has poorly expressed his arguments - or has failed to identify an available argument - should not stand between him and success. Separate consideration should also be given to those arguments that can be discerned from his Notice of Appeal or the written submissions he has filed.
 [10] Approached in such a manner, it is considered that the appeal should be dismissed."
As to other arguments made by Mr Rahman, the Court (at [14]) held that "no question arises as to the constitutional competence of the Commonwealth Parliament to enact the Bankruptcy Act or to make provision for the issue of a bankruptcy notice or the making off the sequestration order" and, (at [16], [18], [19]) the Federal Magistrate's conclusion that his Honour "was not satisfied that Mr Rahman had an "arguable case" and, in making the sequestration order, had committed no appellable error, indeed "it is respectfully concluded that the Federal Magistrate was manifestly correct in the order made." The Court dismissed the appeal (with costs, including the costs thrown away by the adjournment on 12 September 2012), holding (at [24]) that it was "without substance".
It is submitted by the plaintiff that this was a vexatious proceeding as the appeal clearly had no real prospects of success. It also contends that Mr Rahman, again, made a number of baseless allegations against his opponent, which had the effect of the proceedings being conducted in such a way as to harass or annoy or achieve another wrongful purpose. 
Mr Rahman asserts here that there were "false notions" by Flick J in respect of the jurisdictional issue and adds - "As mentioned in the above submissions the nature of whole spectrum of NSW
Judiciary and its Officials [ except few] are in continuous practices of violations and transgress of the substantive enactments against the Ethnic citizens for favour to their social'GENOMES' -the Officials of the
Government Department . They are acting as lawmaker and make laws of their whim of minds whatever He /SHE [McCallum J, P.Garling, Johson , Facferling and others and Registrar Bradford C.

Rule of law'- The natural justice that has been violated by those Officer that has given birth - injustice , crimes under acts mentioned and judicial bias -judicial racism' by the judicial mafias of Supreme Court of NSW must be restrict, restrained and restraining order be made for the applicant and other citizens - (for all Ethnic Australians) under Internal Criminal Court
Act ( Ratified as Nation State )for the true administration of justice under
International standard order be made and therefore for its relief accordingly.

As it is evident all the above decision by the those 'Quorum of Judges' '
JUDGE in the High Court and Supreme Court ' are of the violation and breach of 'procedural fairness and rules of law the Supreme Court of NSW as well as High
Court of Australia as it is established that those Judicial mafias has hijacked the Justices and engaged in taking the life , wealth and property of the Ethnic Australian whom sought justice for the cause of unlawful acts by those white lineage but in the name of justice take away property, from them , incarceration for default of payment , or any other hardships and render into homeless , property less ,breaking of families and children , other social norms of customs and bereft them from happy life but enormous tragedy living in a country whom - Government declares for Australia 's Democratic ethics by ratified the International Treaties for human dignities but Judicial members [ except few] are in continuous practices of 'Crimes against humanity; as they did by the Nazi to its Jews - Holocaust .

Likewise Australia is in constant practice of 'Neo -Holocaust against its Ethnic Australian ' [' when there no law as like the <case> [ Aborigines not to be counted as citizens) and Aborigines - (Stolen Generations- by the
Judges , Supreme Courts [States] and High Court of Australia , Commonwealth
Government in disguise through its Judicature members(s) [ whom employment are racial and without transparency but political motives] since long time
Specially Supreme Court and High Court engaged by such crimes against the domestic law and International Human rights covenants and other International law by breaching and transgress as a neo-holocaust and it must be arrested without impunity and thereby relief for the victim -Ethnic Australian by the
International Criminal Court under statutes.

Such a neo- holocaust as devised and are in practises by the judicial mafias of Australia as did by the Nazi Court of Germany to penalise the non-German ethnicity -Jews and consequent holocaust and for the Aborigines -Stolen Generations' by the Regimes - inhuman crime against humanity, when Hon.Spigelman , Ex-Chief Justice , Supreme Court, NSW (Resign on 30 June 2011) is one the survivor of such holocaust remains silence when knowing every affairs within his jurisdictions as being Chief of the Judicature NSW Supreme Court as well Hon. Robert Fanchis, Chief Justice High Court, as appointed by the Labor Government - after retirement of the Hon.Gleeson CJ as Political principles and as transparency.

Long time spans of time the Australian Judiciary has compounded that 'sin' / transgression [unlawful decisions without statute] by legitimising all the acts of the Executive -Departmental Officials who took law in to their own hands- a decisions based not on points of law- ' but a frightening signal from the Australian judiciary'.

As it is evident that Gregory .Smith, A.G, the Applicant has totally failed and frustrated His Ministerial responsibility- as Attorney-General, for the
Good Government of Liberal' for the 'Administrations of Justice'. But on the contrary he has applied ' A declaratory relief' against the Defendant to infringe' the Right' Justice -Human Dignity - under International covenant for an Ethnic minority , having different social, cultural and education background- doing a Juris Doctor, Post -Graduate , Law, UTS [ to qualify for
Solicitor / Barrister ] having profound knowledge and skills in Administrative law, Constitutional Law, International Law, Human Rights Law and
Jurisprudence.

But His Hon.G.E.Smith ,Attorney-General is seeking a 'significant curtailment of a citizen's right; whom the order is sought in good faith against the
Defendant(s) proceedings from Judicature members who are in practices of:' 'jus cogens 'discretions by not obedient to the 'rule of law' for binding norms of adjudication -Jones versus Skyring <case>; [(1992) 109 ALR 303] at 306 ,Toohey J-High Court Rules 0.36 rule 6(1) 
In submitting such Dictum of Statutory and substantive law' the Defendant is seeking order for himself and on behalf of common citizens of the Australia [whom have constrain of access to the judiciary is such right issues] that
Your Hon will frustrate and prohibit such notions of ' encroachment of Human
Dignity ' by Gregory Smith for serious crimes of concern to the Defendant and, other Ethnic Citizens of distinct educational, socio-cultural and religious affiliations and as well did with the Aborigines by Australian Judiciary for centuries - Crimes of 'Stolen Generation' legalise for penalty and took over their wealth , pecuniary and property ownership by the Judiciary's' identical pronouncement / judgments are nothing but absolutely crimes as well as to the whole international community". <case> 
On 1 November 2013 Mr Rahman applied for special leave to appeal from the judgment of Flick J. Amongst other things, the application states - "The judgment Order as made by the FLICK J on 5 October 2012 are the violation of the' Legality of Party' in these proceeding - Respondent '
Rosalind versus Dubs 'is of FRAUD" identity as claimed 'Non -
Executive Director' C/ Norton Rose, Australia , is ' misnomer' ( a
Simile like 'Hobo or Immoral woman') having no 'Permanent Residence' for legal correspondence , in Australia . But R V Dubs under care of an
Agents' -Paul Baram, who is also under 'cover of fraud identity. Both of them are engaged in 'Crimes 'as perpetrator under both State (s) and
Commonwealth [Crimes
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/)" .When evidence of Judgments were made by the Judges of the NSW Supreme Court and
Court of Appeal for'Fraud Respondent-RV Dubs,and thereby order sough for penalty -s327- liable to imprisonment for 10 years but was denied as discretions.
 ...

But His Hon. FLICK J, made wrong order as favour toward the Respondent
RV Dubs,-DOC18, as of 'discretions' by not obedient to the 'rule of law as liable for penalties for -Conviction, imprisonment s327-Perjury, s329,s333 -subornation of perjury - is liable to imprisonment for 14 years under Crimes Acts for crimes of 'FRAUD' as perpetrator, DOC.Y and
DCOC.Z". [Emphasis original].
Since the decision on the application was given after the hearing in this matter concluded, I have not given it any consideration. However, I think I am entitled to consider this application with all the other material given that Mr Rahman, in his written submissions in this Court, referred to the case, submitting that Flick J had erred in respect of the Constitutional issues he had raised and alleging fraud by Ms Dubs. The application for special leave is all of a piece with the other documents created by Mr Rahman in complaining about the decisions of the courts which are adverse to him and shows a consistent attitude both to those decisions and the response which he believes he is entitled to make respecting them. 
Discussion
I bear in mind the considerations to which Davies J referred in Gargan, quoted above, in particular the caution with which the issue of making vexatious proceedings order must be undertaken. The three main elements here relied on by the plaintiff are the habitual, frequent and persistent undertaking of proceedings which were "an abuse of process" and or "instituted or pursued without reasonable ground" (vide [s 6(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/s6.html) and (b)) and proceedings which were "conducted in such a way as to harass or annoy, cause delay or detriment or achieve another wrongful purpose" (vide [s 6(d)).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca191482/s6.html) In relation to the last of these, the plaintiff has pointed to the scandalous and baseless allegations he has made of both judicial officers, and persons involved in the litigation he has instituted. This habit has continued its expression in the submissions made by Mr Rahman in the present proceedings. Whilst I do not doubt that, so far as the non-judicial persons against whom such allegations were made would have been likely to harass and annoy them and, I think, intentionally so, I would not make such a finding in respect of judicial officers, whose duty is to disregard such calumnies though no doubt with the irritation that the introduction of baseless or irrelevant material creates.
I take into account that Mr Rahman has come to this country, as I understand it, when he was an adult and might therefore have some difficulty in understanding the legal system. Although it is obvious that English is not his first language, he is quite fluent, has a substantial vocabulary and, though the formulation of his notions is somewhat disorganized, he is well capable of conveying the thrust of what he wants to say. I am quite satisfied that he understands fully what he says and what is said to him. I have given careful consideration to whether his possible ignorance of the legal system and difficulty with language provides any explanation or possible excuse for his frequent unsubstantiated allegations, insults and abuse. Making every possible allowance, however, I have concluded that neither of these factors have played any significant role in his conduct or the substance of his contentions. 
It is clear from Mr Rahman's submissions in this proceeding that he still considers, as stated above, he was entirely justified in undertaking the proceedings which form the basis of the plaintiff's application and, moreover, making the allegations to which I have referred. I should, in all justice, make the point that not only has he never produced the slightest iota of evidence to prove these allegations, the record shows that he has consistently been treated with patience and courtesy. Whether he actually believes the allegations does not matter very much. He is clearly unwilling to accept any adverse decision made by persons having statutory or judicial responsibilities and refuses to accept the finality of litigation. 
In my view it is plain, when the course and character of the proceedings undertaken by Mr Rahman is considered at as a whole, that he has persistently undertaken proceedings which were bound to be futile as they had no proper basis either in law and fact and, to bolster his cases, has resorted to allegations of corruption, bias and incompetence. He is unable, or unwilling, to accept that any view other than that for which he contends can be correct and has continually attempted to bypass adverse decisions by commencing fresh proceedings dealing with the same issue. 
Mr Rahman's abuse and manipulation of the system of justice has resulted in the incurring of substantial costs by those who have been unfortunate enough to have fallen afoul of his interests or indignation. Though costs orders have been made (leaving aside orders for indemnity costs), it is obvious that the entire expense of resisting his claims cannot be recovered. Further, other costs in time and trouble are simply thrown away. There has also been a massive waste of judicial resources in dealing with his futile claims.
I take into account, of course, that granting the orders sought will present a significant obstacle for Mr Rahman in obtaining access to the courts and tribunals of this State. However, this follows from the appropriate application of the Act in his case. All these cases present issues of degree. There is no bright line that marks the boundary indicating that a litigant has acted vexatiously. In this case I have reached the conclusion, which I think is inevitable, that Mr Rahman has habitually and persistently instituted and conducted proceedings that are an abuse of process and have been conducted without regard to the real issues. Furthermore, it is evident from his submissions in this case that he has no insight into his behaviour and no intention of changing his approach to the institution or conduct of proceedings. 
Conclusion
The orders of the Court are as follows - 
Mr Rahman is prohibited from instituting proceedings in New South Wales without first obtaining leave of the Court; no further steps are to be taken by Mr Rahman in any proceeding already instituted by him in New South Wales without leave of the Court; all proceedings already instituted by Mr Rahman in New South Wales are stayed pending leave of the Court to proceed; the defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs.
