EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
HER HONOUR: These proceedings were commenced by statement of claim filed in December 2012. By notice of motion filed December 2013, the second defendant sought orders under [Rule 28.2](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/s28.2.html) of the [Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolreg/ucpr2005305/) for the separate determination in advance of the trial of a question as to which of two insurers is liable to indemnify Silver City Drilling against legal costs and liability for compensation arising from the plaintiff's claim. 
Today, the parties have appeared seeking orders in terms which are agreed on the footing that the question which has arisen be determined prior to the hearing. 
The plaintiff is a quadriplegic who is presently receiving benefits paid by one of the insurers and there is some urgency in having this question resolved. 
It is apparent from the submissions which the parties have advanced that it is appropriate for the matters which are agreed to be determined prior to the hearing. 
The questions hinge on whether at the material time the second defendant was an employer in the coal industry. That will be resolved by evidence as to the nature of its business. That is an issue which concerns only it and the two insurers and one in which the plaintiff and the first defendant do not need to be engaged.
Its resolution is an important one, however, for the proceedings and will resolve that part of the litigation expeditiously, so that those not properly involved in the proceedings will no longer be caught up expending unnecessary time and cost. 
In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the parties' agreement should be given effect consistently with the requirements of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/). The orders sought are made in terms of the short minutes which I will mark MFI 1 as amended at the hearing so far as order 7 is concerned. Costs are reserved. 
The matter is adjourned on that basis to a date to be fixed.
