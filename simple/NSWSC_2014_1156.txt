EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
The Crown has made an application pursuant to [s 32](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s32.html) of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/) to permit the witness, Mr Gove Junior, to attempt to revive his memory in the witness box by way of reference to a document, namely Crown voir dire exhibit BB. 
I have considered the provisions of [s 32](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s32.html) and, in particular, [s 32(2)(b)(i)(ii).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ea199580/s32.html) I have also considered the aspects that need to be taken into account with regard to a grant of leave by way of [s 192](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s192.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/). Without running through each of those seriatim, I consider that those factors as a whole argue in favour of the application being granted. 
Furthermore, I regard the evidence of what the accused allegedly said in Livingston Avenue on the afternoon of 20 June 2011, in particular with regard to alleged threats of retaliations, as highly probative. 
In the circumstances, I do not see any basis upon which, by way of any discretion, the procedure pursuant to [s 32](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s32.html) should not be permitted. 
In short, having taken into account [ss 32](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s32.html), [55](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s55.html), [137](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s137.html), and [192](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s192.html) of the [Evidence Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), I propose to grant the Crown leave to have the witness use voir dire exhibit BB in an attempt to revive his memory in the witness box.
