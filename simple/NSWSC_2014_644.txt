EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT
These proceedings were commenced by summons in May 2009, supported by an affidavit sworn by Mr Spark, the NSW Crime Commission's then Assistant Director, Financial Investigations, who deposed to his suspicions that the defendant Rodney John Tyas, had engaged in serious crime related activities, namely cultivating by enhanced indoor means, prohibited drugs, namely cannabis and supplying cannabis contrary to [s 23(2)(a)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s23.html) and [s 25(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/s25.html) of the [Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/dmata1985256/) , respectively, as well as knowingly dealing in the proceeds of crime, contrary to <case> of the Crimes Act 1900 , for reasons there explained. 
On 22 May 2009, Kirby J made restraining and other orders under [s 10](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s10.html) and [12](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s12.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) , in respect of Mr Tyas' interests in certain property (see New South Wales Crime Commission versus Tyas (Supreme Court of New South Wales, 27 May 2009, unreported).
In January 2012, Gzell J made further orders by consent under [s 27](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/s27.html) of the [Criminal Assets Recovery Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara1990272/) and [s 101](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/s101.html) of the [Civil Procedure Act 2005](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa2005167/) as to interest. 
The parties now ask the Court to make further orders by consent, varying the restraining order to permit further satisfaction of the proceeds assessment order to be given, by sale of a property.
Having considered the terms of the order sought and the circumstances in which they are pursued, I am satisfied that the Court's discretion should be exercised in the terms which the parties have agreed. 
Accordingly, I make orders in the terms sought.
