Before: 
Garling J  
Decision: 
Pursuant to [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s103.html) of the [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), I grant leave to counsel for the accused to cross-examine Mr Perkins with respect to those five offences  
Catchwords: 
CRIMINAL LAW - procedure - witnesses - cross-examination - CRIMINAL LAW - evidence - judicial discretion to admit or exclude evidence - [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/); [s (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s103.html) - leave to adduce evidence in cross-examination of criminal convictions; application for - otherwise contrary to [Evidence Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/); [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s102.html) - credibility rule - five dishonesty offences - reliability and credibility of witness  
JUDGMENT - APPLICATION TO ADDUCE CREDIBILITY EVIDENCE
Miss Traill, counsel for the accused, makes an application for leave to adduce evidence in the cross-examination of Mr Grant Perkins which would otherwise be contrary to [section 102](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s102.html) of the [Evidence Act 1995](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), namely, the credibility rule. 
Miss Traill's application deals with five convictions commencing on the 28 January 2009 and concluding on 13 July 2012. The identified offences for which Mr Perkins was convicted in that period would, in my view, be properly regarded as offences which bespeak dishonesty. They are matters which affect the credibility of Mr Perkins and, consequently the reliability of his evidence, which is a most important factor in the case. 
Mr Grant Perkins gives some evidence as to what he saw and heard at the time of the shooting. That evidence would, if accepted, be antithetical to the accused's case that, at the time of the shooting, he was acting in selfdefence.
Accordingly, I am satisfied that cross-examination in respect of those five offences may or could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of Mr Perkins. 
Orders
I make the following order: 
Pursuant to [section (1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/s103.html) of the [Evidence
Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ea199580/), I grant leave to counsel for the accused to cross-examine Mr Perkins with respect to those five offences. I note that the Crown does not oppose the grant of leave.
