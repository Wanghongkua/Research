JUDGMENT - EX TEMPORE
By Originating Process filed 26 November 2013, the Plaintiffs, Messrs Resnick and Silvia, as liquidators ("Liquidators") of DJG Securities Pty Ltd ("Securities") sought a declaration that the transfer of 1,000 shares in the first defendant, DJG Equities Pty Ltd ("Equities") by Securities to the second defendant, Mr Hitchings, on or about 14 May 2013 was voidable under [s 588FE](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s588fe.html) of the [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) (Cth) and an order under [s 588FF](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s588ff.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) that the transfer was void as at and after the date it was made. By short minutes of order proposed at the hearing of that Originating Process, the Plaintiffs also sought an order that the register maintained by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") in relation to the shareholding in Equities be rectified to record Securities as the holder of the 1,000 shares in Equities, the position prior to the challenged transfer. 
In my judgment delivered on 7 February 2014 ([2014] NSWSC 36), I made the first and second orders sought in the Originating Process, declaring the relevant transfer to be void, but did not make an order for rectification of the register maintained by ASIC in respect of Equities where ASIC was not party to the proceedings and had not been given notice of that application. I granted leave to the Liquidators to restore the matter should they pursue the application to rectify the register after having given notice of that application to ASIC. 
By Interlocutory Process filed by leave on 20 February 2014, the Liquidators pursued an application for rectification of the register maintained by ASIC in respect of Equities. The Second, Third and Fourth Defendants consent to the orders sought. The First Defendant, Equities, is not in a position to do so since it currently has no directors. The Liquidators' solicitors have given notice of the application to ASIC, which has indicated that it neither opposes nor consents to the orders sought. 
The application is brought under [s 1322(4)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1322.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) which provides that the Court may, on the application of an interested person, make an order directing the rectification of any register kept by ASIC under the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/). The Liquidators are plainly interested persons, where the position presently recorded in ASIC's records in respect of Equities reflects the result of the transfer by which Securities was deprived of its shareholding in Equities, which I have held to be void. The application raises two questions of law, first, whether the register marked by ASIC which is sought to be rectified is a register which is capable of rectification under [s 1322(4)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1322.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) and, second, whether the power of rectification under [s 1322(4)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1322.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) permits rectification of such a register where a dealing was required to be notified by statute, but the content of that notification was incorrect. Each of those questions has been considered in recent authorities. 
First, the power of rectification of a register under [s 1322(4)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1322.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) extends to permit the rectification of a register maintained by ASIC under [s 1274](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1274.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), which requires ASIC to keep such registers as it considers necessary in such form as it thinks fit, and also to those registers that are prescribed under reg 9.1.01 of the [Corporations Regulations 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolreg/cr2001281/) (Cth). In Re MIG Property Services Pty Ltd (No 2) <case>; [(2012) 92 ACSR 234], Robson J similarly ordered that ASIC's register of companies be rectified where his Honour found that a change to the shareholding recorded in that register had not been validly made. 
I would adopt the broader view of the scope of [s 1322(4)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s1322.html) of the [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/) taken in the authorities to which I have referred above. In this case, the process leading to entry of the current information in ASIC's register of the shares in Equities was invalid, so far as it was founded on a notification to ASIC of a share transfer that the Court has held to be void. The correct position, reflecting the invalidity of that transfer, is that which the Liquidators seek to have recorded in the register maintained by ASIC. This seems to me to be sufficient to support the order for rectification of the ASIC's register now sought by the Liquidators. Such an order will not, of course, require ASIC to take any action in respect of those forms which were previously filed with ASIC from which ASIC extracted the information now included in the prescribed register of companies, which may remain accessible as a matter of record, as distinct from recording the true position reflecting the outcome in my earlier judgment in the register as it now stands.
Accordingly, I make the following order: 
That the Australian Securities & Investments Commission register in relation to the shareholding of DJG Equities Pty Limited (ACN 147 086 780) (the first defendant) be restored to record DJG Securities Pty Limited (ACN 852 792) (in liquidation) (the first plaintiff) as the holder of all 1,000 shares in DJG Equities Pty Limited (ACN 147 086 780).
