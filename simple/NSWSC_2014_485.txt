Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/) - whether sentence infected by Muldrock error - application granted - matter referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal  
JUDGMENT
The applicant was convicted of an offence of aggravated sexual assault under [s 61J(1)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/s61j.html) of the [Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ca190082/) . The maximum penalty for that offence was 20 years imprisonment. The standard non-parole period was 10 years (see [s 54B](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1999278/s54b.html) of the [Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1999278/) ). In November 2010, Lakatos DCJ sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment of 6 years, 6 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years. An appeal against conviction was dismissed, but a Crown appeal on sentence was allowed, with the result that the applicant was re-sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 years and a non-parole period of 6 years (see FB versus Regina; Regina versus FB <case> He is eligible for release on 8 August 2015.
The applicant seeks a review of that sentence under [s 78](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/s78.html) of the [Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/) . He requests that his case be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal as an appeal against sentence, under [s 79(1)(b)](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/s79.html) of that Act. The basis for the application is error in the Court of Criminal Appeal's sentencing decision of the kind discussed in Muldrock versus The Queen <case>; <case> - [27].
Submissions have been made both by the applicant and by the New South Wales Attorney General. The Attorney General submitted that Muldrock substantially changed the way a sentencing court is to apply the provisions of [Part 4](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/index.html#p4), Division 1A of the [Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cpa1999278/), with a standard non-parole period no longer being a dominant factor in sentencing. The Attorney General conceded that in the result, a fair reading of the appeal judgment established that the decision to allow the Crown appeal was made on the application of erroneous legal principle. The Attorney General accepted that the circumstances were such that the application ought to be granted, there being no discretionary reasons for its refusal.
The applicant's circumstances are briefly that he was convicted of having penile/vaginal intercourse with a 14 year old, year 8 student of a school of which he was Principal, after giving her two tablets, while she was staying at his family home. She later awoke to find him having intercourse with her.
At the time of sentencing the applicant was already serving a custodial sentence for other sexual intercourse offences. This offence had occurred earlier in time. It was found by the sentencing judge to have fallen just below the mid-range of objective seriousness. The sentence imposed was made concurrent with the sentence already being served.
The grounds of appeal pressed by the Crown were that the sentence did not adequately reflect the objective seriousness of the offence, given the finding that it fell just below the middle range of objective seriousness and that it was manifestly inadequate.
The sentence was found to be manifestly inadequate. As to the standard non-parole period it was observed at [150] - [154]: It is plainly the position, the respondent having been found guilty after trial, that the standard non-parole period had direct application by force of statute. It was not merely there to serve as a guidepost on sentence in the situation where a plea of guilty has been entered (R versus Way <case>; <case>).
The sentencing judge was obliged to have regard to both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period (R versus Achurch <case> per Garling J at [180]).
 In the present matter, the sentencing judge concluded that the objective gravity of the offence fell "just below the mid range of objective seriousness". Although perhaps somewhat generous to the respondent, there was no challenge by the Crown to this finding.
 The real question arising on the Crown appeal is whether there was any justification, in the findings his Honour made in relation to subjective circumstances or otherwise, that would permit the imposition of a non-parole period of no more than four years. The standard period for this offence if it were in the mid-range of objective seriousness was 10 years. In my opinion, with all due respect to the sentencing judge, I have been forced to conclude that his Honour's reasoning fails to justify such a substantial departure from the standard non-parole period.
 First, it may be observed that the non-parole period imposed is only 40 per cent of the standard non-parole period. Secondly, the overall term of the sentence was 6 years, a sentence itself well below the standard non-parole period. Each of these factors in itself is sufficient, in my opinion, to suggest or point strongly to error, unless the apparent discrepancy can be explained by the respondent's subjective circumstances, or by some other matter.
 However, there is nothing in those subjective circumstances, or elsewhere in the sentencing material, that would warrant such a substantial departure from the standard non-parole period. The respondent was entitled to have the sentencing court take into account his depressive state and the judge did so.
However, this circumstance could not, in the present matter, possibly outweigh or undermine the objective seriousness of the offence. As the courts have repeatedly stated in this context, ill health cannot be allowed to become a licence to commit crime, nor should offenders expect to escape punishment because of the condition of their health. Of course, it will be the responsibility of the Correctional Service authorities to provide appropriate care and treatment for prisoners with illness and disabilities (R versus Vachalec [(1981) 1 NSWLR 351] at 353 - 354). This factor could not have explained the selection of a four year non-parole period.
The parties' agreement that these observations reveal Muldrock error must be accepted, it having there been concluded that R versus Way <case>; [60 NSWLR 168] it was concluded that a Muldrock error such as here occurred, can constitute a relevant "mitigating circumstance". In the result it was ordered that: "[79] The form of the declaration should take account of the fact that Latham
J was persuaded that the sentencing judge and Court of Criminal Appeal had applied sentencing principles which should not have been applied in the light of the High Court's judgment in Muldrock: at [9]. Both courts approached the sentencing exercise on an erroneous view of the law. That was an error capable of giving rise to a doubt or question as to the correctness of the sentence imposed. The court should make a declaration in the following terms: 
Declare that an error of law on the part of the sentencing judge and, on appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal, which may have caused a sentence to be imposed of greater severity than would otherwise have been the case, constitutes an aspect of the proceedings giving rise to the sentence which may form the basis of a doubt or question as to circumstances having the potential to mitigate the sentence imposed, for the purpose of considering an application for an inquiry under [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/s78.html) of the [Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/) .
If such a situation is established, the whole case is referred to be dealt with as an appeal, including all questions of fact and law involved (see Mallard versus R <case>; <case> - [13]).

Conclusion
In the result I am satisfied that there is sufficient evidence of Muldrock error in this case to justify the referral of the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The common position of the applicant and the Attorney General that the Court of Appeal's reliance on R versus Way has sufficiently infected the sentence imposed that the Court must now intervene by granting this application, should be accepted as raising the sense of disquiet necessary to be established, before a reference under [s 79](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/s79.html) is made (see Application of Peter James Holland under [s 78](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/s78.html) [Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/) <case> at <case>).
The Crown raised the question of whether before such a reference, an inquiry should be held under [s 79(1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/s79.html) The result of such an inquiry may also lead to a referral of the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal under [s 82(2).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/s82.html)
This is not a case where the applicant seeks to rely on new evidence, but rather where the application of sentencing principles arises for consideration. Despite conceding the Muldrock error, the Crown does not concede that the sentence imposed on appeal was inappropriate. Given that there is no issue as to the nature of the error here in question, in my view the application should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to determine whether the Muldrock error affected the sentence imposed on the applicant as the result of the Crown appeal. 
In the circumstances, that is a matter which must be determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal and does not require prior investigation under [s 79(1)(a).](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/cara2001219/s79.html)
The application is accordingly granted and the matter referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal as an appeal under the [Criminal Appeal Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/caa1912137/).
