JUDGMENT
Questions about whether a private manager of a protected, or other form of managed, estate is entitled to any (and, if so, what) remuneration for the performance of the functions of a manager have been the subject of consideration by the Court in several judgments (including Gell versus Gell <case>; [(2005) 63 NSWLR 547] at 241-243 provided guidance as to the principles governing the appointment of managers of the estates of people in need of protection.
Prima facie, the office of manager of the estate of a managed person (as defined by [s 38](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/s38.html) of the [NSW Trustee and Guardian Act 2009](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/) NSW), or any analogous office, is a gratuitous one.
If a manager of such an estate is to be allowed remuneration out of the estate under management there must be an order of the Court, or legislation, permitting it to be allowed. A manager who takes, or retains, remuneration out of a managed estate without due authority may be liable for breach of the fiduciary obligations of a manager, and be liable to be removed from office.
In response to an observation made in the Ability One judgment <case> at <case>, and upon consideration of the orders required to give effect to that judgment, the NSW Trustee and Guardian ("the NSW Trustee") invited the Court to make an order (under [s 64](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/s64.html) of the [NSW Trustee and Guardian Act 2009](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/)) providing for it to be authorised, in defined circumstances, to allow a private manager of a managed estate remuneration out of the estate.
The orders and notations set out below are made today so as to provide a framework within which the NSW Trustee can, in an appropriate case, allow remuneration to a private manager (subject to review by the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal, and by the Court in the exercise of its statutory and inherent jurisdiction).
In accordance with established principle, any such remuneration must be limited to an amount that is just and reasonable in the context of the particular estate; and the NSW Trustee must be satisfied, inter alia, that it is in the best interests of the managed person that remuneration be allowed.
For reasons that are more fully considered in the Ability One judgment, it remains important: (a) that estates under management be the subject of practical supervision by the NSW Trustee in discharge of its statutory functions; and (b) that persons interested in such an estate have a framework within which decisions affecting the estate can be dealt with in an orderly manner.
The NSW Trustee has had an opportunity to be heard about, and takes no objection to, the content and form of the orders and notations today made.
The orders will remain under review in the light of experience.
The orders may be discharged or amended from time to time, as circumstances may require.
Having regard to the role of the NSW Trustee in the management, or monitoring, of the estates of managed persons in this state (outlined in M versus M  <case>, it is important for all persons interested in the due management of such an estate to take into account the activities of, and to endeavour to work constructively with, that corporation.

ORDERS
I make the following orders and notations: 
Note that: these orders are made by the Court pursuant to the [NSW Trustee and
Guardian Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/) NSW, [s .](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/s64.html) nothing in these orders is intended to limit: the operation of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/s115.html) of the [NSW Trustee and Guardian Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/) NSW; or the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to the management of estates or the guardianship of persons.
 by operation of [s ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/s70.html) of the [NSW Trustee and Guardian Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/ntaga2009258/) NSW, a decision made by the NSW Trustee and Guardian under Order 3 may be the subject of an application to the Civil and Administrative Tribunal for an administrative review under the Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997
NSW.
 the Court reserves an entitlement, of its own motion, or on the motion of any person interested in the estate of a managed person, to review a decision made by the NSW Trustee and Guardian under Order 3.

Order, subject to further order, that Order 3 applies if and only if, in relation to the particular estate of a managed person in respect of which a claim for remuneration is made by a manager of the estate, the manager has been authorised, by an order of the Court or by legislation governing a "Trustee Company" within the meaning of the [Trustee Companies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consolact/tca1964208/) NSW, to charge fees for performance of the functions of the manager of the estate.

Order, subject to any order of the Court, that the NSW Trustee and
Guardian be authorised (upon the passing of accounts of the manager of the estate of a managed person or otherwise) to allow, out of the estate of the managed person, such, if any, remuneration (including expenses) of the manager as may be just and reasonable, subject to being satisfied that: the manager has duly performed the functions of a manager; and it is in the best interests, and for the benefit, of the managed person to do so.

Order, subject to further order, that, within three months after 30 June each year or within such other time as the Court may allow, the NSW Trustee and Guardian provide to the Court a written report on the operation of these orders, including a statement of the frequency, nature and quantum of any remuneration allowed by the NSW Trustee and Guardian during the immediately preceding year ended 30 June.

Reserve to the NSW Trustee and Guardian liberty to apply generally for an order that these orders be discharged or varied.
