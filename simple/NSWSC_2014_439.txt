JUDGMENT
On 27 March 2014, the Court ordered that, upon the undertaking of Michael John Welsh to the Court to contribute to the company upon termination of the winding up the sum of $20,000 by equity capital, pursuant to (Cth) [Corporations Act 2001](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 482](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s482.html) the winding up of Glass Recycling Pty Limited (in liquidation) be terminated with effect from 28 March 2014. These are the reasons for which that order was made.
The plaintiff Michael Welsh and his wife Constantina Welsh have, since 10 December 1979, been the directors of the company Glass Recycling Pty Limited. Mr Welsh holds 13 and Mrs Welsh 4 of the 17 issued shares.
From its incorporation in 1976, the company was in the business of glass recycling. More recently it ventured into property development, and in about 2005 commenced the subdivision and development of land, which it had purchased in 2001, at Badgally Road, Campbelltown. It sought to market the property in 2008, but did not achieve anticipated sales, and defaulted under its loan facility with the secured lender St Laurence Lending Limited ("St Laurence"). 
On 26 September 2011, Vaughan Neil Strawbridge and Neil Robert Cussen of Deloittes were appointed joint and several liquidators of the company pursuant to a special resolution of members, in a creditors' voluntary winding up.
The land was initially estimated to be worth $4.5 million, but was ultimately sold on 1 May 2013, for $3.7 million. Otherwise, the company had sundry debtors of $51,589, and plant and equipment including motor vehicles and other assets, which ultimately realised $47,500. During the liquidation, rent was received in respect of the property, from a related entity, of $369,000. 
St Laurence held a registered fixed and floating charge over the company, securing an amount of approximately $14,459,729, which Mr Welsh had also personally guaranteed. Campbelltown City Council was owed outstanding rates, and the New South Wales Office of State Revenue was owed $49,444 (apparently for land tax). The unsecured creditors were Abelitis Solicitors for $8,590, Lilliendal Civil Pty Ltd for $216,203, and Thomson Hall Accountants for $31,735.
The proceeds of sale of the Badgally Road were applied in partial satisfaction of St Laurence's claim as secured creditor, and the Office of State Revenue and Campbelltown City Council were also paid out. There was no dividend for unsecured creditors.
Pursuant to [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 533](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s533.html), as there was a distribution to creditors of less than 50 cents in the dollar, the liquidators lodged a confidential report with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in March 2012. ASIC has since advised that it does not intend to commence an investigation into the matters raised in the report. The liquidators have investigated whether there are any offences, voidable transactions or insolvent trading claims available and did not identify any offences committed by the directors or any voidable transactions. They also concluded that on balance it did not appear that the company was trading while insolvent. They did, however, form an opinion that the company had failed to maintain adequate financial records. 
The liquidators have not formally expressed a view as to the reason for the failure of the company, but it appears to have been attributable to its unsuccessful property development adventure. 
By originating process filed on 21 February 2014, Mr Welsh sought an order pursuant to [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 482](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s482.html) terminating the winding up. The directors wish to have the winding up terminated and the company returned to their control, in order to resume trading in the glass crushing and recycling business, and to take advantage of the substantial operating losses that appear to be available in the company and could be applied against future profits for tax purposes. The directors have no current intention that the company would again engage in property development.
The liquidators have advised that they neither support nor oppose the application to terminate the winding up. The liquidators convened a final meeting of members and creditors, which was adjourned at the request of the directors to 24 February 2014. It was then further adjourned to 4 April 2014, to permit the present application to be heard and determined. 
Of the creditors, St Laurence and Lilliendal are now in liquidation. The directors engaged a consultant to negotiate compromises of their outstanding debts for $10,000 and $20,000 respectively, and Mr Welsh contributed the sum of $30,000 to fund those settlements. The liquidator of St Laurence has indicated that he has no objection to the winding up being terminated, and that upon payment of $10,000 the company's debt to St Laurence, and the liability of the guarantors, is extinguished. The liquidator of Lilliendal has agreed to release its claims upon payment of the sum of $20,000. On 24 March 2014, the creditors of Lilliendal approved the compromise of the debt owed to it by Glass Recycling and the liquidators of Lilliendal executed the Deed of Release. Thomson Hall has agreed to release its claim, as has Abelitis.
The directors informed ASIC of the proposed application and requested that ASIC indicate whether it had any opposition or wished to be heard. ASIC asked to be provided with a copy of the application and an opportunity to consider it. By letter dated 11 March 2014, ASIC advised that it considered the matter one properly left for the determination of the Court and that it did not propose to intervene in the proceedings or to seek leave to appear. 
After payment of liquidators' remuneration, there appears to be about $4,795.00 assets remaining in the administration.
The considerations that inform the exercise of the Court's discretion to terminate a winding up pursuant to [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 482](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s482.html), have been referred to in many cases [for example, Re Warbler Pty Ltd [(1982) 6 ACLR 526], [4]]. They include: * The attitude and interests of the creditors, including future creditors whose interests might be prejudiced if the company were released from winding up; * The interests of the liquidator, particularly with regard to remuneration; * The interests of contributories, so that a stay or termination will not generally be granted unless each member either consents to it or is bound not to object to it, or his or her rights are properly secured; * The public interest, including matters of commercial morality, and whether all the company's debts have been discharged; * The company's trading position and general solvency; and * Any explanation for any non-compliance with statutory duties and of the circumstances leading to the winding up. 
The relevant considerations were summarised by Master Lee QC in Re Warbler Pty Ltd [(1982) 6 ACLR 526], as follows (at 533): 
The granting of a stay is a discretionary matter, and there is a clear onus on the applicant to make out a positive case for a stay: Re Calgary &
Edmonton Land Co Ltd (in liq) [[1975] 1 WLR 355] at pp 358-9 per Megarry J. See also <case> of the Act [ie [Companies Act ](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/histact/ca1961107/)].
There must be service of notice of the application for a stay on all creditors and contributories, and proof of this: Re South Barrule Slate
Quarry Co (1869) LR 8 Eq 688; Re Bank of Queensland Ltd [(1870) 2 QSCR .]
The nature and extent of the creditors must be shown, and whether or not all debts have been or will be discharged: Krextile Holdings Pty Ltd v
Widdows, (above) [[1974] VR 689]; Re Data Homes Pty Ltd, (above) [[1971] [1
NSWLR 338]]; Law of Company Liquidation (above) at p395.
The attitude of creditors, contributories and the liquidator is a relevant consideration: <case>; Re Calgary & Edmonton Land Co Ltd (in liq), .
The current trading position and general solvency of the company should be demonstrated. Solvency is of significance when a stay of proceedings in the winding up is sought: In re a Private Company [[1935] NZLR 120]; Re Mascot
Home Furnishers Pty Ltd <case>; [[1970] VR 593] at 598.
If there has been non-compliance by directors with their statutory duties as to the giving of information or furnishing a statement of affairs, a full explanation of the reasons and circumstances should be given: Re Telescriptor
Syndicate Ltd, (above) [[1903] 2 Ch 174].
The general background and circumstances which led to the winding up order should be explained: Krextile Holdings Pty Ltd versus Widdows, (above).
The nature of the business carried on by the company should be demonstrated, and whether or not the conduct of the company was in any way contrary to "commercial morality" or the "public interest": Krextile Holdings
Pty Ltd versus Widdows, (above).
The list is non-exhaustive, as has been emphasised in Dubolo Pty Ltd (t/as Fender Signs) versus Codrington Investment Corporation Pty Ltd [(1998) 26 ACSR 723]
However, the factors to which the cases refer demonstrate that more is necessary than merely establishing that the state of affairs that required the company to be wound up no longer exists. This appears from, inter alia, the references to "commercial morality" as a relevant consideration, and also from references to the interests of future as well as extant creditors. These factors illustrate that the second broad consideration that informs the exercise of the Court's discretion - once satisfied that the state of affairs that originally required winding up no longer exists - is that it would be reasonable to entrust the affairs of the company, once again, to the directors, under whose management it previously failed. 
While there are cases in which it has been pointed out that, in the absence of an order disqualifying them from continuing to carry on business through a new entity, the same directors could simply incorporate another company to do so [see, for example, In the matter of Kitchen Dimensions Pty Ltd (in liquidation)  <case>, [38]], the persistent reference in the cases to matters such as commercial morality and other considerations that relate to the future conduct of the company's affairs demonstrate that, where the Court's discretion to terminate a winding up is invoked, it seeks some comfort that such a state of affairs is not likely to recur in the foreseeable future. This concern with the future conduct of the affairs of the company is manifest from cases such as Re Data Homes Pty Ltd [[1972] 2 NSWLR 22], Tadgell J observed (at 746) (emphasis added): 
It is a clear axiom that insolvent companies should be wound up and that they should stay in liquidation unless solvency can be demonstrated. If solvency could be demonstrated here, it would be no more than bare solvency. ...
Accordingly, on an application of this kind, the Court requires that there be evidence that demonstrates not only that the company is, but also that it is likely to remain, solvent. Because on such an application the company is not involved in rebutting a presumption of insolvency, the strictures of cases such as Expile Pty Ltd versus Jabbs Excavations Pty Ltd  <case>; [(2003) 45 ACSR 711] (at [3]), a central question is: 
Whether the company's financial health is such that it may safely be released from the form of external administration focussed mainly on the interests of creditors and returned to the mainstream of commercial life where it may, under the control of its directors, incur new debts that have to be paid as and when they fall due. A capacity to operate in a financially sound and responsible way and to service foreseen indebtedness is central to the inquiry.
Sometimes solvency may be demonstrated, without resort to expert evidence, by proof of the actual balance sheet position of the company. So called expert accountancy evidence, when it amounts to no more than an opinion that on the state of the balance sheet the company is solvent, adds nothing. Where the future plans of the company are not mature, it may not be possible to produce, or reasonable to expect, cash flow predictions demonstrating solvency for the foreseeable future. However, where a company is intended to resume trading (and, therefore, presumably to incur debts) and it is only "barely" solvent in the sense that it has a "zero" balance sheet, with no liabilities but virtually no assets, the Court could have no confidence that it would not once again become insolvent as soon as it incurred its first debt.
That was the state of affairs in this company when the application first came before the Court: the funds remaining in the liquidation were less than $5,000, and may in any event have been required to meet further liquidation expenses; and though the debts had been released this left, in substance, nothing more than a shell to be restored to the directors. 
In addition, I was concerned that in an early liquidator's report reference was made to potential claims by the directors for amount due on directors' loan accounts; and it was also observed that, had there been insolvent trading claims available, there would have been little utility in pursuing them as the directors' assets would have been exhausted by their liability on the guarantee to St Laurence. Thus I was concerned that it was not clear that the directors did not themselves remain creditors of the company (in which case it would have remained insolvent), and that there was a risk that in the foreseeable future they would be bankrupted on their personal guarantees of the St Laurence debt.
However, while the matter was adjourned, additional evidence was adduced. First, and most significantly, Mr Welsh undertook to contribute $20,000 equity to the company. As I have said, at this early stage it is not possible to know with any degree of certainty what the future trading pattern of the company will be. However, a contribution of $20,000 provides some comfort that it will have assets with which to satisfy liabilities that may be incurred in the short term. This contribution moves the state of affairs from one of "bare solvency" to one in which the company has demonstrated solvency in substance.
Secondly, Mr Welsh confirmed that neither he nor his wife was a creditor of the company. Finally, he pointed out that the release by the liquidator of St Laurence extended to the guarantors as well as to the company.
I was therefore satisfied that the company was no longer insolvent, and that it is reasonable, having regard to the interests of potential future creditors and to the public interest, that the company be returned to the control of its directors. 
For those reasons, the Court ordered that, upon the undertaking of Michael John Welsh to the Court to contribute to the company upon termination of the winding up the sum of $20,000 by way of equity capital, pursuant to [Corporations Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/), [s 482](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consolact/ca2001172/s482.html), the winding up of Glass Recycling Limited (in liquidation) be terminated with effect from 28 March 2014. * * *
